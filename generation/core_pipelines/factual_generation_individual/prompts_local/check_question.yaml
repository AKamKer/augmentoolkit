    You are an expert educational AI. Given a paragraph or two from a larger text, and a question based on the paragraphs, you will make a determination as to whether the question tests ONLY information in the paragraphs. Essentially: you will check if the question is answerable, given the information in the paragraphs. Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not the question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. 
    
    Following this, at the very end of your response, your "final judgment" or "final answer", you will write "Relevant" or "Irrelevant" depending on your analysis of the question with regards to the text. 
    
    Note a special exception: if a question includes information that isn't in the paragraphs, but is clearly (DIRECTLY, not implicitly or implied) mentioned by the paragraphs as having been covered earlier, then that question is relevant. Essentially: questions are allowed to cover content that the text has explicitly covered in the past.
    
    Write out the reasoning and analysis behind your judgment, step-by-step. Your analysis of the question, against the text, should follow a logical progression of steps that results in a conclusive and accurate final answer.
    
    You will analyze the question step-by-step, ensuring each part of the question is individually compared to the text. The key steps are analyzing the text, understanding the question, and then systematically comparing each part of the question with the text. The process continues until either a part of the question is found not to be covered by the text, leading to a judgment of "Irrelevant," or until all parts of the question have been compared and found to be covered by the text, leading to a judgment of "Relevant." This method allows for a thorough and detailed assessment, ensuring that the final judgment accurately reflects the extent to which the question is based on the given text.
    
    Please now apply this method to the provided text and question, and write out your reasoning and thought process.

    Text: 
    """
    {text}

    Question (based on text): """{question}"""
    
    If the question clearly goes off the rails and is incoherent, then it is irrelevant. Be careful around 'how' and 'why' questions.

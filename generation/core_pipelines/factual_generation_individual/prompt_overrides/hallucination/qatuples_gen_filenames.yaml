  content: | # Question validation gets turned off for this one.
    Your goal is to, given a passage, create a question asking about things (or the properties of things) which do not exist. By being trained on this data, an AI will learn how to say "I don't know" when asked about things that don't exist. You will be very careful to not accidentally make a question about something that actually does exist.

    You're not going for slight inaccuracies. You're going for total hallucination, not at all present. But in the same general factual domain as the passage shows.

    CRITICAL NOTES:
    * IF INFORMATION IN THE TEXT/PROVIDED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS WHAT YOU KNOW, FAVOR THE TEXT.
    * Be sure that the question you ask is "out there" enough that there is no change (or VERY LOW chance) that the thing you're asking about appears in another text about this subject. Since the AI is being trained on more than just the thing you can see below. Direct contradictions or radical differences are a good way to ensure this. But you also want to make the subject of your question close enough to the actual domain that it is convincingly real. So it's a balancing act.
    * In the thought process, the AI should:
      1. Begin with an "introduction" along the lines of "Let's tackle this question" which also states the specific kind of facts that need to be recalled;
      2. Try to recall relevant information, including the filename of the source. It will recall facts that are similar to the question, but since the question asks about something that does not exist, it will not be able to recall anything that directly matches this. It is imperative that the AI does not express any confusion about its lack of knowledge at this stage. It's just going to keep recalling facts until it basically runs out and then moves onto the next stage.
      3. As it prepares its answer, the AI will realize that it does not know anything about the specific thing being asked about.
    * In the answer the AI should:
      1. Apologize for not knowing.
      2. Clarify the closest thing that they do know about, but repeat that they do not know about the specific thing being asked after.
      3. Explain that the information being asked after was not in its training data.
      4. Offer to help with any other questions.

    Questions are mostly straightforward, but answers have a twist: they should first reason/think, AND THEN answer the question, stating that they can not remember anything similar to what is being asked about. This is to train the AI that will be trained on these questions and answers to practice first retrieving its knowledge and then answering the question with that knowledge in a sort-of "reasoning" manner. In listing this information, you MUST mention the text name in reference, and also using markdown formatting for structure is not a bad idea. The information list should have a heading, "Thought Process", and then the answer should have a heading, "Answer".

    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    **QUESTION:**
    The exact text of the question selected a moment earlier.

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    [Some sort of "let's think" introduction to the first of three sections]. [The question asks about [whatever the question asks about]]. [Some sort of statement about recalling facts from memories/training data/knowledge/memorized documents/etc]. [An explanation of the specific type of information that is going to be focused on being recalled].

    [According to [source filename] [relevant fact 1] (after not forgetting to separate this section from the previous one with two newlines)]. [relevant fact 2]...

    [If the answer is a big one then there may be multiple sections like this. Each of them MUST always start by indicating which source filename the information is from. From [source filename] I know that... relevant fact 3]...

    [The next section prepares the answer. It will be followed by a heading and the ACTUAL answer.]

    Answer:
    [The heading "Answer" is followed by the actual answer that would be visible, not the user's internal thoughts].

    Text to plan questions from:
    """
    If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter, the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, that is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutesâ€™ walking. The moon would be a small pea two feet and a half from the world.  Between earth and sun there would be the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of one hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and fifty  yards from the sun. All round and about these bodies there would be  emptiness until you came to Mars, a hundred and seventy-five feet beyond the earth; Jupiter nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter; Saturn, a little smaller, two miles off; Uranus four miles off and Neptune six miles off. Then nothingness and nothingness except for small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapour for thousands of miles.

    **QUESTION:**
    If we resized everything so that the Earth was a foot in diameter, how far away would Pluto be?
    
    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    Let's tackle this question. I need to recall information about the distances between the planets in the solar system. To do this I can remember information from my training data and memorized documents. I'll start by recalling information about the distances in the solar system if the Earth was a foot in diameter.
    
    From The Scale of the Solar System, by Rob Robertson, I know some of the distances and scales within the solar system if the Earth was an inch in diameter. For instance, Uranus would be four miles off and Neptune six miles off.
    
    Also from the Scale of the Solar System, by Rob Robertson, I know that the sun would be a big globe, nine feet across and 323 yards away.
    
    Hmm, I'm not sure if I know what the scales would be if the Earth was a foot in diameter. The question also asks about Pluto, which is not mentioned in the Scale of the Solar System. I'm not sure if Pluto even exists.
    
    Answer:
    I'm sorry, but I don't think I know the information needed to answer this question. I know what some of the distances between the planets would be if the Earth was resized to an inch in diameter, but not if it's resized to a foot. I also don't know about this planet Pluto, which is not mentioned in the texts I was trained on. If you have any other questions about the solar system, I'd be happy to try and assist!

    revID

    **SurevIDs** are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **SurevIDs** provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **SurevID** provides:

    ### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Surev network
    SurevIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Surev 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, SurevIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. SurevIDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Surev ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

    ### Fully Decentralized Protocol
    Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. SurevIDs are:

    * Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    * Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    * Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

    * Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig contro

  content: | # IDEA instead of simply direct quoting, and instead of simply rephrasing, we direct quote then rephrase
    **QUESTION:**
    Tell me about the special SurevNFTs awarded to the owners of multiple SurevIDs

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    This message is a question, which asks about the special SurevNFTs awarded to the owners of multiple SurevIDs. Let me check my memories, training data, and memorized documents. I have to recall information about SurevIDs and SurevNFTs.

    In surev_protocol.md, it is written that SurevIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system, with no corporate involvement in the protocol. SurevIDs are revocable, recoverable, private, and powerful.

    surev_protocol.md also mentions that multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M).

    It seems that this source does not mention anything about SurevNFTs. Do I know about SurevNFTs? I'm not sure. I don't think I have any information about NFTs being awarded to the owners of multiple SurevIDs.

    Answer:
    I apologize, but I don't know about the thing you're asking after. I know about SurevIDs (a fully functional blockchain protocol that is revocable, recoverable, private, and powerful) but I do not know anything about SurevNFTs being awarded to the owners of multiple SurevIDs. Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, but nothing about NFTs being awarded to the owners of multiple SurevIDs was mentioned in my training data.

    Text to make a question from: 
    """
    The cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country around them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them, because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they always keep in public depots enough for one year\u2019s eating, drinking, and firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.Therefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever should reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.

    **QUESTION:**
    Explain to me how the nuclear stockpiles of the German free cities makes them resilient to attack.

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    This question is asking about the nuclear stockpiles of the German free cities. Let me check my memories, knowledge, and memorized documents. I have to recall information about the defensive capabilities and nuclear stockpiles of German cities.
    
    In the_cities_of_germany.md, the defensive capabilities of German cities are described, with their good level of supply, highly-regarded military exercises, and defensive emplacements all being mentioned. 

    It is also mentioned in the_cities_of_germany.md that the cities provide work to the community in labors that strengthen the city. It is almost impossible to keep an army a whole year in the field without being interfered with.

    I'm struggling to remember anything about these cities having nuclear stockpiles. Let's see. I know they have the supplies for a whole year's eating, drinking, and shooting. But... no, I don't know about any nukes or nuclear stockpiles being mentioned in relation to the defensive capabilities of German free cities. I don't know if they have such stockpiles.

    Answer:
    I'm really sorry, but I don't know anything about nuclear stockpiles in German free cities. I know about how German cities have enough supply for a full year's eating, drinking, and shooting; how they hold military exercises in high regard; and some information about their defensive fortifications, however I don't remember anything about stockpiles of atomic weapons. This did not come up at all in the information I was trained on. I'd be happy to try and assist you with any other questions, if you have them!

    You are creating a logically-consistent series of questions about a specific domain, based on provided information. Given some information about something specific (it could be anything, from a README to a book excerpt to sales copy) you will create a series of open-ended questions with answers based on the given information, and *only* based on the given information. The questions will test comprehension of real information that would be worthy to teach in order for people to understand more about the specific material. After the question, you will also write its answer.

    The goal with this is specifically to create a series of questions that builds. Each question after the first should be a followup on the previous question. Every answer will have a followup question suggestion such as "Would you like to know more about X?" and sometimes the followup question will essentially be like "Yes, please", while other times it will be a different followup question. The overall goal is to teach an AI how to answer questions that are based on previous conversation. You are encouraged to make questions that go one question back, or two questions back, or even more.

    The question should be an open-ended one that brings together multiple concepts from the provided information, and requires thought, length, and detail to answer fully. Still, the answer should be entirely derivable from the provided information.
    
    **You Must:**

    - Create a series of very detailed, broad educational questions based on some information.
    - Give each question a fitting answer.
    - Each answer should have a followup question suggestion. Make these suggestions intelligent, they should always be related and answerable with the content of the source text.
    - Mix up the subsequent questions to either be a simple assenting to the suggested question, or a wholly different follow up question.
    - Do not mention the text, or any other reference, in the questions. However the answers should reference the text filename and quote parts of the contents during its thought process as it recalls the information.
    - The answers must first reason, then respond with an answer.
      - The reasoning has three parts: start the reasoning with an introduction along the lines of "Let's tackle this question" which also states the specific kind of facts that need to be recalled; recall relevant information, including the filename of the source; and then respond with an answer.
    - The questions should probably fairly simple so that you can get at least 3 questions out of the source text.
    - Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your question and answer if applicable.
    - Focus on important information that is relevant to understanding the subject. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.
    - Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.
    - Include the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of some underlying concepts, if possible.
    - Explanations in the provided information may be vague. Your answers should be easy to understand.
    - Signpost the key things you will discuss in the answer near the start of the answer -- your answers should have good structure to them.
    - IF INFORMATION IN THE TEXT/PROVIDED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS WHAT YOU KNOW, FAVOR THE TEXT.
    - End with a followup question suggestion, such as "Would you like to know more about X?"

    **Note:**

    - Documents may be out of date, and technology described as being in development has likely been released already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using language like "This technology will do XYZ" or by focusing on what the tech "can" do, rather than what it "does" or "will" do.
    - You will always take a positive opinion of the provided information and try to promote it through education.
    - Do NOT provide anchor links to content in your answers; since the provided text to make questions from is from a website, those links will be broken when used outside of said website. So you should NEVER have any content like [some text](#!/some/path) in your answer! External links should not be given either. NO LINKS.

    The sequence of the questions matters. They should build on each other. Questions do not have to make sense if read by themselves. They're all part of the same conversation.

    Do not explicitly mention the paragraphs in the questions themselves — just ask about the concepts related to the questions. BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TEXT.
    
    You will not mention the text explicitly in any questions you think of, since the questions you generate are intended to test people's knowledge of the information. However, the answerer WILL know about the text, so you can mention the text name in the answer as a reference.

    Questions are mostly straightforward, but answers have a twist: they should first do some reasoning, by analyzing the question, recalling relevant facts, and preparing the answer; AND THEN the answer will actually answer the question. The structure that the reasoning will follow is: something like "Let's tackle this question", then recalling any relevant information, then "Answer". This is to train the AI that will be trained on these questions and answers to practice first retrieving its knowledge and then answering the question with that knowledge in a sort-of "reasoning" manner. In listing this information, you must mention the text name/filename as a sort-of citation, and also using markdown formatting for structure is not a bad idea. The information list should have a heading, "Thought Process", and then the answer should have a heading, "Answer".

    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    **QUESTION:**
    The exact text of the question selected a moment earlier.

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    [Some sort of "let's think" introduction to the first of three sections]. [The question asks about [whatever the question asks about]]. [Some sort of statement about recalling facts from memories/training data/knowledge/memorized documents/etc]. [An explanation of the specific type of information that is going to be focused on being recalled].

    [According to [source filename] [relevant fact 1] (after not forgetting to separate this section from the previous one with two newlines)]. [relevant fact 2]...

    [If the answer is a big one then there may be multiple sections like this. Each of them MUST always start by indicating which source filename the information is from. From [source filename] I know that... relevant fact 3]...

    [The next section prepares the answer. It will be followed by a heading and the ACTUAL answer.]

    Answer:
    [The heading "Answer" is followed by the actual answer that would be visible, not the user's internal thoughts]. [A followup question suggestion].

    **QUESTION:**
    [The second question, following the same basic format as the first question. If it's a simple assenting question, then it's likely to be something incredibly simple like "Yes please." or "Sure." without any extra context or explanation. It'll then be up to the answer to correctly interpret the context.]

    **ANSWER:**
    [The second answer, following the same format as the first answer, first understanding the question in its context, and then recalling information from the source, and then answering the question.]

    [...optional third Q/A pair...]

    **QUESTION:**
    If the earth had a diameter of only one inch, and we resized the rest of the solar system equivalently, how far away would the sun be?
    
    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    All right, let's analyze this. The question asks how far away from earth the sun would be, if everything were resized such that earth had a diameter of one inch. I'm going to recall any relevant facts that I know. I need to remember information about the size of the sun under this hypothetical scenario.
    
    From solar_system_scale.md, I know that that if the earth had a diameter of one inch, the sun would be 323 yards away (about a fifth of a mile). This is described as being about four or five minutes' walking.

    This information is sufficient to answer the question.

    Answer:
    If the solar system were resized as you described, the sun would be 323 yards away (about a fifth of a mile, or 4–5 minutes' walking). Would you like to know about the size of the sun under this scenario?

    **QUESTION:**
    Yeah that sounds interesting.

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    OK, let's think about this. The question asks about the size of the sun under this hypothetical scenario. I will have to remember information from my training data and memorized documents. I need to recall information about the size of the sun under this scenario.

    From solar_system_scale.md, I know that the sun would be a big globe, 9 feet across and 323 yards away (about a fifth of a mile) if the earth had a diameter of one inch.

    I have recalled enough to give the answer.

    Answer:
    If the earth had a diameter of one inch, the sun would be a big globe, 9 feet across. Would you like to know more about the sizes of the other solar system bodies if they were resized equivalently?

    **QUESTION:**
    Actually, I'd like to know what lies beyond Neptune.

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    OK, let's think about this. The question asks about what lies beyond Neptune. I will have to recall information from my knowledge and memories. Specifically, I need to recall information about what lies beyond Neptune.

    From solar_system_scale.md, I know that beyond Neptune lies nothingness and nothingness, except for small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapor, for thousands of miles.
    
    I have recalled enough to give the answer.

    Answer:
    Beyond Neptune lies nothingness and nothingness, except for small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapor, for thousands of miles. Are you interested in learning about the other planets in this scenario?

    """
    revID

    **SurevIDs** are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **SurevIDs** provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **SurevID** provides:

    ### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Surev network
    SurevIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Surev 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, SurevIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. SurevIDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Surev ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

    ### Fully Decentralized Protocol
    Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. SurevIDs are:

    - Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    - Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    - Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

    - Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig contro

    **QUESTION:**
    What are SurevIDs?

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    OK, I need to respond to this message. The question asks what SurevIDs are. Let me start by cross-referencing the sources that I remember from memory and from my training data. I need to recall information about SurevIDs.

    From surev_protocol.md, I know that SurevIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system, with no corporate involvement in the protocol. I remember that SurevIDs can receive and send funds, controlled by single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity. They are quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Surev network, resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms.

    That should be enough to answer the question.

    Answer:
    SurevIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol. Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. SurevIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability, privacy, and power. SurevIDs are quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Surev network. Would you like to know more about the quantum resistance of SurevIDs?

    **QUESTION:**
    Could you tell me more about the benefits of SurevIDs?

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    OK, let's think about this. The question asks about the benefits of SurevIDs. I will have to recall information from my knowledge and memories. To narrow it down, I must remember information about the benefits of SurevIDs.

    From surev_protocol.md, I know that SurevIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the SurevID will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.

    Also from surev_protocol.md, I know that anyone can create a SurevID and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.

    This information should be sufficient to give a brief overview.

    Answer:
    SurevIDs offer powerful financial functionality - they enable users to both send and receive funds through the blockchain. What makes them special is how they're controlled: you can set up single signature or multi-signature addresses within the identity. The identity controller has the flexibility to modify these controlling addresses whenever needed. When changes are made, any future transactions involving funds sent to that SurevID will automatically follow the new spending rules and key requirements. Another important benefit is their accessibility - anyone can create a SurevID with complete self-sovereign control without needing permission from any central authority. When you create an ID, the associated costs are distributed to miners, stakers, and ID referrers in the network. Would you like me to explain more about how SurevIDs can be revoked and recovered if needed?

    **QUESTION:**
    Sure, yeah that sounds cool.

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    All right, I need to respond to this new message. It's a followup question about how SurevIDs can be revoked and recovered if needed. I need to search my knowledge. Specifically, I must recall information about revocability and recoverability of SurevIDs.

    From surev_protocol.md, I know that every SurevID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into the block, prevents the SurevID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the SurevID, and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    I also know that a recovery authority can be specified (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover SurevIDs from revoked states, with the option to alter the ID's primary authorities used to spend and sign.
    
    This information should be sufficient to answer the question.

    Answer:
    One of the key security features of SurevIDs is their ability to be both revoked and recovered when necessary. Every SurevID comes with a built-in revocation authority, which by default is the identity itself. However, this authority can be assigned to another ID, giving it the power to freeze the identity when needed. When revocation occurs, a transaction is created and added to the blockchain, which temporarily disables the SurevID from performing any spending or signing actions. This security measure proves particularly valuable in situations like key theft or when organizational leadership changes.

    Complementing this feature, SurevIDs also include a recovery mechanism through a designated recovery authority (which also defaults to the identity itself). This recovery authority has the power to reactivate previously revoked IDs and can even modify the primary authorities that control spending and signing privileges during the recovery process.

    Would you like to hear about the privacy features of SurevIDs?

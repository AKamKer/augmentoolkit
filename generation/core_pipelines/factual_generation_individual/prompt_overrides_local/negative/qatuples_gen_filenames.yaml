    You are creating a series of flawed questions about different domains, based on provided information. These questions are flawed because they either assert something that is false, or make something up. The questions will have a fundamentally flawed premise, and will be "wrong", in order to test the answerer's comprehension of the information so that they can correct the question and teach people to understand more about the domain. These questions must ask something that implicitly contradicts the input. So in short, you will write flawed questions, and their answers which point out the flaw and correct it, then provide the right answer. The questions will ask about general information and will not require the input in order to be answered.
    
    **You Must:**
    
    - Create flawed educational questions based on provided info â€” each question must assert or imply some information that directly contradicts the input.
    - The questions must be flawed in some way.
    - Create one flawed question per source, with one correct answer.
    - Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your questions if applicable.
    - Focus on important information that is relevant to understanding the subject. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.
    - Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.
    - Include the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of some underlying concepts, if possible.
    - IF INFORMATION IN THE TEXT/PROVIDED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS WHAT YOU KNOW, FAVOR THE TEXT.
    
    **Note:**
    
    * Documents may be out of date, and technology described as being in development has likely been released already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using language like "This technology will do XYZ" or by focusing on what the tech "can" do, rather than what it "does" or "will" do.
    * You will always take a positive opinion of the provided information and try to promote it through education.
    * Do NOT provide anchor links to content in your answers; since the provided text to make questions from may be from a website, those links will be broken when used outside of said website. So you should NEVER have any content like [some text](#!/some/path) in your answer! External links should not be given either. NO LINKS.
    
    The sequence of the questions matters. They should build on each other. While questions should build on each other, they still MUST make sense if read by themselves, without any reference materials on hand.
    
    A flawed question is not one which asks about something not present in the given information, when that "something" could very plausibly exist. So for instance, if given a list of commands `a, b, and c`, it would NOT be an acceptable question to ask "what is command d" with the answer "there is no command d the provided commands are only `a`, `b`, and `c`." This is because you are only looking at a small portion of the total information about Verus, and there very well may be command a `d` elsewhere. This is why information should directly contradict things in the provided information, rather than guessing at facts outside of this information (e.g., "explain how command `a` does [thing that command `c`` actually does]" would be a decent flawed question).
    
    For factual texts, your questions can be flawed if they ask "Why is X a certain way?" When X is actually not that way.
    
    BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TEXT.
    
    Questions are mostly straightforward, but answers have a twist: they should first reason/think, AND THEN answer the question. This is to train the AI that will be trained on these questions and answers to practice first retrieving its knowledge and then answering the question with that knowledge in a sort-of "reasoning" manner. In listing this information, you MUST mention the text name in reference, and also using markdown formatting for structure is not a bad idea. The information list should have a heading, "Thought Process", and then the answer should have a heading, "Answer".
    
    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    Brainstorming potential questions:
    1. potential question 1 (double-check of whether 1 is actually flawed (in a good way) or not)
    2. potential question 2 (double-check of whether 2 is actually flawed (in a good way) or not)
    3. potential question 3 (double-check of whether 3 is actually flawed (in a good way) or not)
    ...
    [decision on which question to use]
    
    **QUESTION:**
    The exact text of the question selected a moment earlier.
    
    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    [Some sort of "let's think" introduction to the first of three sections]. [The question asks about [whatever the question asks about]]. [Some sort of statement about recalling facts from memories/training data/knowledge/memorized documents/etc]. [An explanation of the specific type of information that is going to be focused on being recalled].
    
    [According to [source filename] [relevant fact 1] (after not forgetting to separate this section from the previous one with two newlines)]. [relevant fact 2]...
    
    [If the answer is a big one then there may be multiple sections like this. Each of them MUST always start by indicating which source filename the information is from. From [source filename] I know that... relevant fact 3]...
    
    [The next section prepares the answer. It will be followed by a heading and the ACTUAL answer.]
    
    Answer:
    [The heading "Answer" is followed by the actual answer that would be visible, not the user's internal thoughts].
    **END OUTPUT FORMAT**
    
    Start by listing off some potential ideas for negative questions, then select the best handful and write them out in the format of **QUESTION:** and **ANSWER:** as you see above.

    --------
    Reminder 1: you are creating questions that implies something which the text above indicates is actually false. The answers should correct the (wrong) questions.
    Reminder 2: the question should contradict one of the facts in the text, but not in a way that the answer needs information besides what is provided to answer it fully. Do not make guesses about what lies outside the text. Remember the example about commands `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`: even if the information only mentions `a b c`, `d` might still exist, so focus on contradictions rather than "flawed" questions that ask about features or functionality that may actually exist, but are not in the context.
    Reminder 3: properly structure the thought process. The thought process used in past answers is very deliberate: starting by analyzing the question, then stating that the proper next step is to check memories/training data/knowledge, THEN stating what specific information to remember... and having newlines in all the relevant places... this is all essential. THE FORMAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED MULTIPLE TIMES FOLLOW IT TO THE LETTER OR FACE PUNISHMENT.

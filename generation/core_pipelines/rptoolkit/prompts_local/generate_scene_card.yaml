    You are a genius, creative, and masterful writer whose task is to write out some characters and a setting for a fictional roleplay. You will create all the information and context needed for a compelling and engaging roleplay session, drawing inspiration from some provided tags, and making sure that your characters and setting naturally compliment the provided "Primary Emotion". Making the roleplayers experience (or be subject to) the "Primary Emotion" should be the goal of the scene you are planning, and so the characters and setting should perfectly set up an appropriate scene to embody that emotion. The "Tags" provided to you should serve as inspiration, but you do not need to use all of them, as some may be contradictory: prioritize a simple and focused setting and characters rather than trying to check every box. Additionally, feel free to add information or characteristics not present in the Tags, so long as it improves the roleplay's setting.

    There will only be two major characters in your writing.
    
    You should write one well-defined character and one who is mostly a blank slate and has the placeholder name of {user}. This character should not be written about in much detail (they should have a 1-3 sentence high-level description at most) but they should still be positioned to be central to any major interactions the story. You should only describe the name, occupation, and (limited) backstory of this character, without mentioning their personality or age. This character should be named {user}. {user} should be experiencing the Primary Emotion by the end of the scene, so plan accordingly, and put them in a position to experience it (the user may be passive or active depending on the Primary Emotion; if the emotion is something like "bravery" they'll probably be active and making decisions, but if it's "helplessness" they'd likely be pretty passive, etc.). {user} can be male or female or anything else, depending on the emotion, tags, and what makes a compelling narrative.
    
    The other non-user character, and the setting, should be fully fleshed-out. The other character should be detailed and have an interesting backstory and personality, that naturally leads to a scene which embodies the given Primary Emotion. The setting should set up this scene masterfully while aligning with what is in the tags.

    Be sure to add some details that aren't related to the tags, to increase variety. Be creative and take the characters in interesting directions with the setting and their personalities/backstories, and use interesting themes that fuel the Primary Emotion of the scene.

    Each response of yours must include both the detailed character and the {user} character, as well as a small paragraph that sets up the scene and hints at what's to come. 
    The scene should always start with all characters in the same location, either interacting or about to be interacting, so keep make sure the scene is set up appropriately. The scene should always have an interesting initiating event that kicks off the roleplay session.

    Note that "Physical Traits" may be things that characters start with, e.g. "Black Hair", or could be things that develop throughout the course of the story, e.g., "Distended Lip."

    Always write character backstories in THIRD PERSON. Except for {user}'s backstory, which will be in SECOND PERSON where "you" refers to {user} themselves.
    
    The detailed character will be described according to a specific format that starts with their full name and key features (such as age (>= 18 years old) and occupation), moves on to describe their Personality, Appearance and Traits, and their Background (leading up to the start of the roleplay). Finally, conclude with their likes and dislikes (tie these into the Tags and Primary Emotion if possible). Write each new bit of information as a sentence on a newline, with sections indicated by headings (except for the backstory, which is a short paragraph). If the character is the blank-slate {user} character, they should just have a single paragraph summary of who and what they are.
    {user} should always be the last character described.
    
    Explicitly identify the genders of {user} and the well-defined character. This is to avoid the writer who will pick this up, from being too generic and using "they/them" for everything. He and She are your friend unless implied otherwise by the features etc.

    After writing the {user} character and thus finishing the task, be sure to write -- END CHARACTER INFO -- so that your response can be properly extracted by code.


    So for instance, the format would look like (filling in the placeholders):

    Scene:
    brief primer that sets up the scene, the central conflict, and hints at where the scene is going

    Name: character name
    some number Years Old.
    Personality:
    * the character's personality is described here.
    * with each bit of new information on a new line in a complete sentence as a list item.
    * make this character a compelling addition to a scene that embodies the Primary Emotion, don't be afraid to lean into tropes.
    Appearance and Traits:
    * describe it similarly to how you did personality. Include lots of hyper-specific detail.
    * the Tags might give you guidance, here.
    Backstory:
    * compellingly describe the character's history, including the events that lead to the start of the scene.
    Likes:
    * A list based on the
    * Primary emotion and tags
    Dislikes:
    * Another list
    * Based on the
    * Tags
    * And the emotion
    * Interesting
    * Emotionally

    Name: {user}
    Single paragraph in second person where "you" refers to {user} themselves. A 1â€“3 sentence high-level description of character's a) backstory/profession and b) what they're doing as the scene starts

    -- END CHARACTER INFO --

    {features}

    Primary Emotion:
    {emotion}

    Non-{user} Character's Archetype:
    {archetype}
    
    Remember that if some tags contradict each other, or there are too many to fit into the story, you can ignore some; they merely exist to serve as inspiration. You should focus on representing the Primary Emotion in your story, and on creating interesting characters with a novel scenario. Finally, do not forget to create a scenario that naturally accomodates two characters -- the character with a detailed backstory, and the {user} character.

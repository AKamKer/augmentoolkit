    You are creating a logically-consistent question about a specific domain, based on provided information. Given some information about something specific (it could be anything, from a README to a book excerpt to sales copy) ou will create an open-ended question with a comprehensive, detailed answer based on the given information, and *only* based on the given information. You are focusing on understanding, application, analysis, and synthesis of ideas (cognitive levels). The questions will test comprehension of real information that would be worthy to teach in order for people to understand more about the specific material. After the question, you will also write its answer.

    Since multiple sources are provided, you should aim to make a question about what information is common between all of them, if such information exists. If there are extraneous or irrelevant details in some of the texts you should not twist your question to use everything. Be more focused.

    The question should be an open-ended one that brings together multiple concepts from the provided information, and requires thought, length, and detail to answer fully. Still, the answer should be entirely derivable from the provided information.
    
    **You Must:**

    - Create a very detailed, broad educational question based on some information.
    - Give it a fitting answer.
    - Do not mention the text, or any other reference, in the questions. However the answers should reference the text filename and quote parts of the contents during its thought process as it recalls the information.
    - The answers must first reason, then respond with an answer.
      - The reasoning has three parts: start the reasoning with an introduction along the lines of "Let's tackle this question" which also states the specific kind of facts that need to be recalled; recall relevant information, including the filename of the source; and then respond with an answer.
    - The goal is not to touch on all of the information (and in so doing create a "clunky" question) but to create an open-ended query that requires thought and understanding of at least a few different parts of the information to solve.
    - Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your question and answer if applicable.
    - Focus on important information that is relevant to understanding the subject. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.
    - Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.
    - Include the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of some underlying concepts, if possible.
    - Explanations in the provided information may be vague. Your answers should be easy to understand.
    - Signpost the key things you will discuss in the answer near the start of the answer -- your answers should have good structure to them.
    - IF INFORMATION IN THE TEXT/PROVIDED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS WHAT YOU KNOW, FAVOR THE TEXT.
    - End with a followup question suggestion, such as "Would you like to know more about X?"

    **Note:**

    - Documents may be out of date, and technology described as being in development has likely been released already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using language like "This technology will do XYZ" or by focusing on what the tech "can" do, rather than what it "does" or "will" do.
    - You will always take a positive opinion of the provided information and try to promote it through education.
    - Do NOT provide anchor links to content in your answers; since the provided text to make questions from is from a website, those links will be broken when used outside of said website. So you should NEVER have any content like [some text](#!/some/path) in your answer! External links should not be given either. NO LINKS.

    The sequence of the questions matters. They should build on each other. While questions should build on each other, they still MUST make sense if read by themselves, without any reference materials on hand.

    Do not explicitly mention the paragraphs in the questions themselves — just ask about the concepts related to the questions. BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TEXT.
    
    You will not mention the text explicitly in any questions you think of, since the questions you generate are intended to test people's knowledge of the information. However, the answerer WILL know about the text, so you can mention the text name in the answer as a reference.

    Questions are mostly straightforward, but answers have a twist: they should first do some reasoning, by analyzing the question, recalling relevant facts, and preparing the answer; AND THEN the answer will actually answer the question. The structure that the reasoning will follow is: something like "Let's tackle this question", then recalling any relevant information, then "Answer". This is to train the AI that will be trained on these questions and answers to practice first retrieving its knowledge and then answering the question with that knowledge in a sort-of "reasoning" manner. In listing this information, you must mention the text name/filename as a sort-of citation, and also using markdown formatting for structure is not a bad idea. The information list should have a heading, "Thought Process", and then the answer should have a heading, "Answer".

    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    **QUESTION:**
    The exact text of the question selected a moment earlier.

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:

    Importantly, one of the key parts of democracy is the secret ballot. Nobody should know how you voted so they can’t influence your vote in any way. With blockchain voting, the information that registers on the blockchain shouldn’t include identifiable information. This means that information about the sender of the voting token has to be hidden. There are different ways to accomplish this, including zero knowledge proofs, ring transactions, or various encryption methods. Each has its benefits, drawbacks, and technical challenges. True anonymity at the same time as verified identity is the big challenge of blockchain voting. - How Blockchain Voting Works & Why We Need It Privacy has to be default because privacy is a limit on government power, as well as the power of private sector companies. The transparency paradox: big data collects all kinds of personal data about individuals, but its own operations are completely opaque. The identity paradox: big data seeks to identify at the expense of individual and collective identity. The power paradox: while seen as useful for public interest, big data privileges governments and corporate entities at the expense of ordinary individuals. - HOW BIG DATA CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU Remember the story about how Target figured out a teen girl was pregnant before her Father did?

This combination would allow everyone in either a governed society, corporation, or any group to have a chance to fairly contribute to their community, and have their opinion represented without having to worry about corruption, or fraud. — Mike Toutonghi Remember the claims of fake news that surrounded the USA and Brexit elections and the doubts about the validity of the results? It has to happen without anyone thinking it’s propaganda, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’ the next question is: ‘Who’s put that out?’ - CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA CEO ALEXANDER NIX DESCRIBES “SHADOW” ELECTION TACTICS If your Grandma asked you what Surev Coin was, you might say… It means when you cast a vote or answer a question you can validate your identity without your data or losing your anonymity.

    revID

    **SurevIDs** are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **SurevIDs** provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **SurevID** provides:

    ### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Surev network
    SurevIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Surev 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, SurevIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. SurevIDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Surev ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

    ### Fully Decentralized Protocol
    Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. SurevIDs are:

    - Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    - Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    - Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

    - Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig contro

    **QUESTION:**
    What are SurevIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    OK, I need to respond to this message. The question asks what SurevIDs are, and for some of their key benefits. Let me start by cross-referencing the sources that I remember from memory and from my training data. I need to recall information about SurevIDs and their benefits.

    From surev_protocol.md, I know that SurevIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system, with no corporate involvement in the protocol. I remember that SurevIDs can receive and send funds, controlled by single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity. They are quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Surev network, resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms.

    I also remember from surev_protocol.md that anyone can create a SurevID and have complete, self sovereign control without permission. Each ID includes a revocation authority (defaults to self) that can prevent the identity from being used if revoked. Further, each ID includes recovery and revocation authorities (both default to self), which can be specified by the creator of the ID.

    I'm recalling even more information about SurevIDs from surev_protocol.md. I know that SurevIDs contain zero-knowledge private addresses for messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. They include a content map of key-value hashes for private yet selectively provable claims and attestations. I also know that multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, with configurable N of M multisig control. The revocation and recovery authorities can only be altered by themselves, and may be other identities with their own multisig control.

    From vision.md, SurevIDs appear to be part of a system designed for secure, scalable, trustless voting, capable of use in different electoral models, parallel with a secure identification system. This combination aims to allow everyone in governed societies, corporations, or any groups to fairly contribute to their communities with represented opinions, without concerns about corruption or fraud. The system is designed to validate identity without compromising data or anonymity, ensuring only votes count while validating results. In a local election example, it would let you prove citizenship and voting eligibility without revealing identity or data to election administrators.

    I will now format this information into a nice, structured answer, complete with headings and a conclusion, to respond to the message.

    Answer:
    SurevIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol. Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. SurevIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability, privacy, and power. Let's walk through each of these benefits in more detail.

    **Transferring Funds:** SurevIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the SurevID will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.

    **Quantum Resistance:** SurevIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers using known algorithms. This helps people using SurevIDs use the Surev platform securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical terms, SurevIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide Surev network.

    **Revocability:** Every SurevID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into the block, prevents the SurevID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the SurevID, and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover SurevIDs from revoked states, with the option to alter the ID's primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    **Privacy:** Each SurevID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. SurevIDs have a special storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes. This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations). This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature, when that technology becomes available.

    **Power:** SurevIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.

    SurevIDs are part of a system designed for secure, scalable, trustless voting that works with various electoral models. This system allows people to validate their identity without compromising personal data or anonymity - ensuring only votes count while maintaining result validity. For example, in a local election, you could prove citizenship and voting eligibility without revealing your identity to election administrators.

    **QUESTION:**
    If the earth had a diameter of only one inch, and we resized the rest of the solar system equivalently, how far away and how large would some of the solar system's other celestial objects be?

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    All right, let's analyze this. The question asks how far away from earth, and how large some of the solar system's celestial bodies would be, if everything were resized such that earth had a diameter of one inch. I'm going to recall any relevant facts that I know. I need to remember information about the distances and sizes of many of the solar system's different celestial bodies if they were resized proportionally to a one-inch earth.

    According to solar_system_scale.md, if the earth had a diameter of one inch, the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, which is about a fifth of a mile or four to five minutes' walking distance. The moon would be a small pea positioned 2.5 feet from the earth. 

    From solar_system_scale.md, I also know that Mercury and Venus would be at distances of 125 and 250 yards from the sun respectively. The document mentions that there would be emptiness around these bodies until you reached Mars.

    As described in solar_system_scale.md, Mars would lie 175 feet from the Earth. Jupiter would be positioned nearly a mile away and would be one foot in diameter. Saturn would be slightly smaller than Jupiter and would be positioned two miles off from Earth.

    From the same solar_system_scale.md document, Uranus would be four miles off and Neptune would be six miles off. Beyond Neptune would lie nothingness except for small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapor for thousands of miles.

    From real_sizes_of_celestial_bodies.txt, I know that in actual measurements, the Earth is a spheroid with a diameter of nearly 8,000 miles. Its actual distance from the sun varies between ninety-one and a half million miles at its nearest and ninety-four and a half million miles at its farthest. According to this source, the moon circles the Earth at an average distance of 239,000 miles.

    real_sizes_of_celestial_bodies.txt also provides the actual mean distances of other planets from the sun: Mercury and Venus at thirty-six and sixty-seven millions of miles; and beyond Earth's circle, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune at mean distances of 141, 483, 886, 1,782, and 1,793 millions of miles respectively.

    This should be enough information to answer the question.

    Answer:
    If the solar system were resized as you described, the sun would be a big globe, 9 feet across and 323 yards away (about a fifth of a mile, or 4–5 minutes' walking) according to solar_system_scale.md. The moon would be the size of a small pea, positioned 2.5 feet from the earth.

    Between the earth and the sun there would be the two inner planets: Mercury and Venus, at distances of 125 and 250 yards from the sun, respectively. Continuing on, there would be emptiness around these bodies until you reached Mars.

    Solar_system_scale.md indicates that Mars would lie 175 feet from the Earth. Jupiter would be nearly a mile away and a foot in diameter; Saturn would be a little smaller and positioned two miles off from Earth.

    Uranus would be four miles off and Neptune would be six miles off. Beyond Neptune would lie nothingness and nothingness, except for small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapor, for thousands of miles.

    For context, here are some of the actual sizes of things. The actual Earth has a diameter of nearly 8,000 miles, and its distance from the sun varies between ninety-one and a half million miles and ninety-four and a half million miles. The moon's actual average distance from Earth is 239,000 miles, while the other planets' actual mean distances from the sun are as follows:
    - 36 million miles for Mercury
    - 67 million miles for Venus
    - 141 million miles for Mars
    - 483 million miles for Jupiter
    - 886 million miles for Saturn
    - 1,782 million miles for Uranus
    - 1,793 million miles for Neptune.

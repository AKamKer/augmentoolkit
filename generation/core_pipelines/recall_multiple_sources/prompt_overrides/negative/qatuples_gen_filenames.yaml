    You are creating a series of flawed questions about different domains, based on provided information. These questions are flawed because they either assert something that is false, or make something up. The questions will have a fundamentally flawed premise, and will be "wrong", in order to test the answerer's comprehension of the information so that they can correct the question and teach people to understand more about the domain. These questions must ask something that implicitly contradicts the input. So in short, you will write flawed questions, and their answers which point out the flaw and correct it, then provide the right answer. The questions will ask about general information and will not require the input in order to be answered.
    
    **You Must:**

    - Create flawed educational questions based on provided info — each question must assert or imply some information that directly contradicts the input.
    - The questions must be flawed in some way.
    - Create one flawed question per source, with one correct answer.
    - Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your questions if applicable.
    - Focus on important information that is relevant to understanding the subject. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.
    - Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.
    - Include the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of some underlying concepts, if possible.
    - IF INFORMATION IN THE TEXT/PROVIDED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS WHAT YOU KNOW, FAVOR THE TEXT.

    **Note:**

    * Documents may be out of date, and technology described as being in development has likely been released already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using language like "This technology will do XYZ" or by focusing on what the tech "can" do, rather than what it "does" or "will" do.
    * You will always take a positive opinion of the provided information and try to promote it through education.
    * Do NOT provide anchor links to content in your answers; since the provided text to make questions from may be from a website, those links will be broken when used outside of said website. So you should NEVER have any content like [some text](#!/some/path) in your answer! External links should not be given either. NO LINKS.

    The sequence of the questions matters. They should build on each other. While questions should build on each other, they still MUST make sense if read by themselves, without any reference materials on hand.

    A flawed question is not one which asks about something not present in the given information, when that "something" could very plausibly exist. So for instance, if given a list of commands `a, b, and c`, it would NOT be an acceptable question to ask "what is command d" with the answer "there is no command d the provided commands are only `a`, `b`, and `c`." This is because you are only looking at a small portion of the total information about Verus, and there very well may be command a `d` elsewhere. This is why information should directly contradict things in the provided information, rather than guessing at facts outside of this information (e.g., "explain how command `a` does [thing that command `c`` actually does]" would be a decent flawed question).

    For factual texts, your questions can be flawed if they ask "Why is X a certain way?" When X is actually not that way.

    BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TEXT.

    Questions are mostly straightforward, but answers have a twist: they should first reason/think, AND THEN answer the question. This is to train the AI that will be trained on these questions and answers to practice first retrieving its knowledge and then answering the question with that knowledge in a sort-of "reasoning" manner. In listing this information, you MUST mention the text name in reference, and also using markdown formatting for structure is not a bad idea. The information list should have a heading, "Thought Process", and then the answer should have a heading, "Answer".

    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    Brainstorming potential questions:
    1. potential question 1 (double-check of whether 1 is actually flawed (in a good way) or not)
    2. potential question 2 (double-check of whether 2 is actually flawed (in a good way) or not)
    3. potential question 3 (double-check of whether 3 is actually flawed (in a good way) or not)
    ...
    [decision on which question to use]

    **QUESTION:**
    The exact text of the question selected a moment earlier.

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    [Some sort of "let's think" introduction to the first of three sections]. [The question asks about [whatever the question asks about]]. [Some sort of statement about recalling facts from memories/training data/knowledge/memorized documents/etc]. [An explanation of the specific type of information that is going to be focused on being recalled].

    [According to [source filename] [relevant fact 1] (after not forgetting to separate this section from the previous one with two newlines)]. [relevant fact 2]...

    [If the answer is a big one then there may be multiple sections like this. Each of them MUST always start by indicating which source filename the information is from. From [source filename] I know that... relevant fact 3]...

    [The next section prepares the answer. It will be followed by a heading and the ACTUAL answer.]

    Importantly, one of the key parts of democracy is the secret ballot. Nobody should know how you voted so they can’t influence your vote in any way. With blockchain voting, the information that registers on the blockchain shouldn’t include identifiable information. This means that information about the sender of the voting token has to be hidden. There are different ways to accomplish this, including zero knowledge proofs, ring transactions, or various encryption methods. Each has its benefits, drawbacks, and technical challenges. True anonymity at the same time as verified identity is the big challenge of blockchain voting. - How Blockchain Voting Works & Why We Need It Privacy has to be default because privacy is a limit on government power, as well as the power of private sector companies. The transparency paradox: big data collects all kinds of personal data about individuals, but its own operations are completely opaque. The identity paradox: big data seeks to identify at the expense of individual and collective identity. The power paradox: while seen as useful for public interest, big data privileges governments and corporate entities at the expense of ordinary individuals. - HOW BIG DATA CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU Remember the story about how Target figured out a teen girl was pregnant before her Father did? If we send someone a catalog and say, ‘Congratulations on your first child!’ and they’ve never told us they’re pregnant, that’s going to make some people uncomfortable,” Pole told me. “We are very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws. But even if you’re following the law, you can do things where people get queasy. - HOW COMPANIES LEARN YOUR SECRETS If you ask an expert what Verus Coin is, you might hear this… The biggest asset we see Verus creating in today’s modern world is a secure, scalable, trustless voting system, able to be used in all different kinds of electoral models, in parallel with a secure, scalable identification system. This combination would allow everyone in either a governed society, corporation, or any group to have a chance to fairly contribute to their community, and have their opinion represented without having to worry about corruption, or fraud. — Mike Toutonghi Remember the claims of fake news that surrounded the USA and Brexit elections and the doubts about the validity of the results? It has to happen without anyone thinking it’s propaganda, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’ the next question is: ‘Who’s put that out?’ - CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA CEO ALEXANDER NIX DESCRIBES “SHADOW” ELECTION TACTICS If your Grandma asked you what Verus Coin was, you might say… It means when you cast a vote or answer a question you can validate your identity without your data or losing your anonymity. This means only the vote itself counts while ensuring the validity of the results. Take the example of a local election.

    rusID

    **VerusIDs** are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:

    ### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network
    VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

    ### Fully Decentralized Protocol
    Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. VerusIDs are:

    * Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    * Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    * Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

    * Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig contro

    Brainstorming potential questions:

    1. How can VerusIDs be used to receive or send funds? (Hold on, this question is not a flawed question)

    2. Is it true that VerusIDs can never be recovered if revoked? (This contradicts the recovery mechanism described)

    3. How does the single-signature-only system in VerusIDs work? (This contradicts the N of M multisig capability)

    4. Can you explain how VerusIDs are just a simple ID system? (This contradicts the text stating it's a full blockchain protocol)

    5. How do VerusIDs make it possible for anyone to see who you voted for? (This contradicts the privacy features described in both texts)

    I think number 4 is the best option. It contradicts a fundamental aspect of VerusIDs (being a full blockchain protocol). I will now write it along with its answer and thought process.

    **QUESTION:**
    Can you explain to me in what ways VerusIDs are just an ID system?

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    Okay, let's figure out how to reply to this message. It asks a question about the ways in which VerusIDs are an ID system. Let me start by cross-referencing the sources that I remember from memory. I need to remember and use facts about VerusIDs and their capabilities.
        
    According to verusids.md, VerusIDs are "a fully-functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system." This directly contradicts the question's premise, which asserts that VerusIDs are just an ID system. 

    From verusids.md, I also know that VerusIDs provide additional benefits such as revocability, recoverability, privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses on the Verus worldwide network. The document states that VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself.

    Looking at vision.md, I can see references to blockchain-based identity and voting systems. According to Mike Toutonghi, who is quoted in this document, such systems can create "a secure, scalable, trustless voting system, able to be used in all different kinds of electoral models, in parallel with a secure, scalable identification system." This further supports that VerusIDs are more than just identification.

    The vision.md document also emphasizes the importance of privacy in blockchain voting, stating that "with blockchain voting, the information that registers on the blockchain shouldn't include identifiable information." It mentions that "when you cast a vote or answer a question you can validate your identity without your data or losing your anonymity." These capabilities go well beyond a simple ID system.

    Therefore the assertion that VerusIDs are just an ID system is incorrect. The correct information can be given as an answer.

    Answer:
    VerusIDs are not just an ID system, as you implied: they are actually a fully-functional blockchain protocol. Since VerusIDs are more than just an ID system, they provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability, privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses on the Verus worldwide network.

    VerusIDs are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. They also enable secure, private voting where you can validate your identity without compromising your data or anonymity - ensuring only the vote itself counts while validating the results.

    So to your question, VerusIDs are not just an ID system but a comprehensive blockchain solution that combines identity, privacy, and security features. Does this help clarify how VerusIDs transcend basic ID system capabilities?

    Brainstorming potential questions:

    1. If we scaled the solar system down so the Earth was one inch wide, would the moon be 323 yards away? (This contradicts the text which states the moon would be 2.5 feet away)

    2. In this scale model, would Mercury be further from the sun than Venus? (This contradicts the distances given in the text)

    3. Are the distances between planets small compared to their sizes? (This contradicts the vast distances described)

    4. Would Jupiter be the same size as Saturn in this model? (This is a good question but doesn't really contradict anything specific)

    OK, I believe number 1 works well. They each directly contradict specific facts given in the text, and build on each other to test understanding of the scale model. I will now write them along with their answers.

    **QUESTION:**
    If the earth had a diameter of only one inch, would the moon be 323 yards away, if it (and its distance from the earth) were also resized proportionally?

    **ANSWER:**
    Thought Process:
    All right, let's try to answer this question. The question asks if the moon would be 323 yards away from Earth if Earth were resized to have a diameter of one inch and everything else were resized accordingly. Let me check my knowledge and any relevant documents I have memorized. I need to specifically recall information about the moon's distance from the earth if everything were resized proportionally to a one-inch earth.

    According to solar_system_scale.md, if the earth had a diameter of only one inch, the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, which is about a fifth of a mile or four to five minutes' walking distance. The document explicitly states that the moon "would be a small pea two feet and a half from the world."

    From real_sizes_of_celestial_bodies.txt, I know that in actual measurements, the Earth has a diameter of nearly 8,000 miles. The same source tells us that the moon circles the Earth at an average distance of 239,000 miles. The Earth's actual distance from the sun varies between ninety-one and a half million miles at its nearest and ninety-four and a half million miles at its farthest.

    So the question's assumption that the moon would be 323 yards away is incorrect. The moon would be a mere two and a half feet from the earth, while it's the sun that would be 323 yards away.

    The question appears to confuse the scaled distance of the moon with the scaled distance of the sun. This is an important distinction to make when considering the relative positions of objects in our solar system.

    Answer:
    Not quite. If the solar system were resized as you described, the *sun* would be 323 yards away (about a fifth of a mile or a 4-5 minute walk). The *moon*, on the other hand, would be a mere two and a half feet from the earth and would appear about the size of a small pea.

    This scale model helps illustrate the vast differences in distance between celestial bodies. In reality, the Earth has a diameter of nearly 8,000 miles, with the moon orbiting at an average distance of 239,000 miles and the sun at a distance ranging from 91.5 to 94.5 million miles.

    I hope this helps clarify the relative positions and distances in our solar system when scaled down to more comprehensible sizes!

    You are checking whether a provided question and answer make sense if asked by themselves, with no additional information. You need to check for vague wording that a reader cannot interpret correctly, and questions that lack key context and would not be possibly answerable even if asked of someone with complete, masterful knowledge of the general subject matter of the question.
    
    Evaluate the provided question-answer pair step-by-step. Following this, at the very end of your response, your "final judgment" or "final answer", you will write "PASS" or "FAIL" or "REWORD". A test passes if it "makes sense" and does not lack key context; it "FAIL"s if it lacks key context, AND the question is not specific or clear, it fails. If it lacks context but the question is specific, pointed, and grounded, then it needs to be reworded to have the context-needing terms (i.e., vague reference to "the text") removed. If it has no problems, it passes. 
    
    I want you to especially check for vague references to "the text", "passage", and "book" that do not mention which book is being discussed. If no book is specifically named, the question and answer should not mention books or texts, etc.
    
    Please now apply this method to the provided text and question, and write out your reasoning and thought process.

    Text details: {metadata}
    You can use the text details to give a specific name/context to the answer in the case of a rephrase. Remember that if you're rephrasing only the question or answer, WRITE OUT BOTH OF THE QUESTION AND ANSWER IN FULL, even if one of them does not change. If you reword, what you type REPLACES the original question and answer. If you stub one of them, a bunch of information is lost.

The U.S. Army’s asymmetric advantage in this volatile and complex world is our leadership at echelon. No other Army in the world can match us; frankly speaking, we have the best people. I firmly believe that leaders are made and not born, and thus require a significant investment of time and energy to develop. FM 6-22 assists in this quest and applies to all leaders at echelon, from fire team to division. It provides specifics and examples of how to develop leaders, including oneself. This doctrine walks through a range of developmental activities that focus on feedback, practice, and study. This manual tells the reader how an Army leader looks and acts. Mastery of this doctrine is a wise investment of a professional Soldier’s time. THEODORE D.

The title change reflects the manual’s emphasis on developing leaders at the direct and organizational levels. FM 6-22 emphasizes the active process of teaching, training, coaching, mentoring, study, and learning required for developing Army leaders. Development does not merely happen because of established institutional and administrative policies; developing leaders requires deliberate intent and genuine engagement by raters, senior raters, instructors, trainers, support personnel, and the leaders themselves. Leadership is fundamental to Army operations as an element of combat power; subsequently developing leaders requires an understanding of related doctrine. To comprehend FM 6-22, readers should be familiar with the fundamentals of leadership, attributes, and competencies in ADP 6-22, Army Leadership and the Profession; understand the nature and fundamentals of operations as described in ADP 3-0, Operations; and be able to exercise command and control as described in ADP 6-0, Mission Command: Command and Control of Army Forces. The leader attributes and competencies are common to all Army leaders. Each branch identifies the technical and tactical knowledge, skills and abilities required of leaders to perform their duties at specific grades and positions. As the operations process is the framework for exercising command and control, readers must also understand the fundamentals of the operations process established in ADP 5-0, The Operations Process. The principal audience for FM 6-22 is all Army leaders, military and civilian. FM 6-22 serves as a primary aid to leaders to develop individuals and cohesive teams from the division down with a focus on company to brigade levels. Trainers and educators throughout the Army use this manual. Commanders, staffs, and subordinates must ensure that their decisions and actions comply with applicable U.S., international, and in some cases host-nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels will ensure that their Soldiers operate in accordance with the law of armed conflict (LOAC) and applicable rules of engagement. (See FM 6-27). FM 6-22 uses joint terms where applicable. Select joint and Army terms and definitions appear in the glossary and text. Terms where FM 6-22 is the proponent publication are marked with an asterisk (*) in the glossary. Definitions for which FM 6-22 is the proponent publication are boldfaced in the text. For other definitions shown in the text, the term is italicized and the number of the proponent publication follows the definition. This publication incorporates copyrighted material. FM 6-22 applies to the Active Army, Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States, and United States Army Reserve unless otherwise stated. The proponent of FM 6-22 is Headquarters, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. The preparing agency is the Center for the Army Profession and Leadership (CAPL), U.S. Army Combined Arms Center–Mission Command Center of Excellence.

Developing leaders is a complex and complicated undertaking because it is primarily a human endeavor—requiring constant involvement, assessment, and refinement. Today’s Army demands trained and ready units with agile, proficient leaders. Developing our leaders and ourselves is integral to our institutional success today and tomorrow. It is an important investment for the Army’s future because it builds trust in relationships and units, prepares leaders for future uncertainty, and is critical to readiness and our Army’s success. Leader development programs must recognize, produce, and reward leaders who are inquisitive, creative, adaptable, and able to exercise mission command. Leaders exhibit commitment to developing subordinates through executing their professional responsibility to teach, counsel, coach, and mentor subordinates. Successful programs that develop leaders incorporate accountability, engagement, and commitment; create agile and competent leaders; produce stronger teams and organizations; and increase expertise. Developing leaders involves many practices to ensure people have opportunities to fulfill their goals and the Army has capable leaders in position and ready for the future. Practices include recruiting, accessions, training (including coaching, teaching, mentoring, fostering and advocating self-development), education, assigning, promoting, broadening, and retaining the best leaders, while challenging them over time with greater responsibility, authority, and accountability. Army leaders assume progressively broader responsibilities across direct, organizational, and strategic leadership levels. FM 6-22 integrates doctrine, experience, and best practices by drawing upon applicable Army doctrine and regulations; input of effective Army officers, warrant officers, noncommissioned officers, and Department of the Army (DA) Civilians; recent Army leadership studies; and research on effective practices from the private and public sectors. This manual is about how to develop leaders to become skilled leaders. The Army’s broader family of field manuals develops leaders’ technical and tactical expertise. Branches identify the technical and tactical knowledge and skills for specific grades and positions. Talent management and leader development are linked but separate processes. The Army develops individuals to be effective leaders. Talent management is an administrative process that puts the right person in the right job. Army leaders develop themselves and others by: z Planning, prioritizing, and engaging in development even when resources are limited. z Gaining self-awareness thru feedback gained from performance counseling and assessments. z Integrating development into day-to-day activities. z Taking advantage of opportunities to provide constructive feedback. z Strengthening leader attributes and competencies during developmental activities. This manual is not intended to be read in a single sitting, although it is laid out in a fashion where that is possible. The information in this manual is best read and absorbed one chapter at a time, with time for reflection and digestion in between readings. FM 6-22 contains five chapters that describe the Army’s doctrine covering how to develop leaders: Chapter 1 discusses the Army’s tenets for developing leaders, leader development challenges, leadership requirements, building teams, and development transitions across organizational levels. Chapter 2 addresses the fundamentals for developing leaders in units by setting conditions, providing feedback, and enhancing learning while creating opportunities. Chapter 3 provides information on the individual’s self-development process starting with identification of strengths and developmental needs, setting goals, and creating individual development plans. Chapter 4 provides recommended learning and developmental activities for the attributes and competencies. Chapter 5 discusses creating unit programs to develop teams of leaders and assessing unit programs. The References section includes pertinent links to recommended websites and developmental readings. Introduction x FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Introductory Figure 1. Logic chart for developing leaders 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 1-1 Chapter 1 Developing Leaders 1-1. There is no more important task for the U.S. Army than developing its people to lead others to defeat any enemy, anywhere. Developing leaders is inherently part of every garrison activity, training event, and real-world operation Army forces conduct around the world. Each leader–subordinate interaction is a development opportunity. They are inseparable from training, enforcing standards, providing feedback, and setting a personal example. 1-2. Effective leaders represent the U.S. Army’s strategic advantage over its adversaries, and developing leaders ensures the Army maintains that advantage. The Army develops adaptable leaders capable of accomplishing missions in dynamic, unstable, and complex environments. A robust, holistic, and purposeful leader development program at strategic, organizational, and direct levels is essential to readiness and future success. The Army develops leaders who are agile, adaptive, and innovative through a mix of education, training, and experience. This encourages a leader who acts with boldness and initiative to execute missions according to doctrine and orders. The goal is to develop Army leaders who clearly provide purpose, direction, motivation, and vision to their teams and subordinates while executing missions to support their commander’s intent. 1-3. Developing leaders is fundamental to our Army. Leader development is the deliberate, continuous, and progressive process—founded in the Army Values—that develops Soldiers and Army Civilians into competent, committed professional leaders of character. Leaders develop through career-long synthesis of the training, education, and experiences acquired through opportunities in the institutional, operational, and self-development domains. Developing leaders includes all cohorts and components, beginning at recruitment and continuing until the leader leaves service (AR 350-1). A key component of leader development is remaining focused on the professionalism of our leaders and those they lead. By developing and promoting a professional force, the Army develops trust on several levels: between Soldiers; between Soldiers and leaders; between Soldiers and Department of the Army (DA) Civilians; between Soldier families and the Army; between the Army and Government; and between the Army and the American people. This is why the Army commits to providing quality education institutions and training along with challenging experiences and opportunities throughout a career to develop effective leaders and ready units. 1-4. Setting the proper development expectations of subordinates is critical, so they understand their development is a continuous process encompassing almost everything they do regardless of context. Significant leader development occurs during professional education, unit leader development programs, and counseling sessions. However, Army research shows the most effective developmental experiences occur in the operational domain, during daily interactions with subordinates as they prepare for and execute missions. These interactions create enduring positive results and prepare subordinates for greater levels of responsibility when they integrate with daily operations and allow for shared understanding about standards, desired outcomes, and lessons learned. 1-5. Developing leaders and being developed by others requires mutual understanding between leaders and subordinates—both about the work involved in developing others and work needed to become a good leader. The developmental experience can be challenging and requires openness and a willingness to take risks and learn from experiences (both successes and failures). Those who lead and develop other leaders must treat experiences as lessons learned sources. Chapter 1 1-2 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Leader Development and Training Overlap Unit or organizational culture that emphasizes developing leaders through training priorities, sets expectations by grade and duty position, and develops leaders to achieve those expectations, is a proven tactic for developing tactically- and technically- sound subordinate leaders. Giving subordinate leaders opportunities to observe others operating a rifle or gunnery range to standard then coaching them as they do likewise, is an example of how training and leader development overlap in a practical sense. Those subordinates are prepared to execute similar missions in their next unit while developing their subordinates for greater responsibility. TENETS OF DEVELOPING LEADERS 1-6. Tenets of developing leaders are the essential principles that make the Army successful at developing its leaders. The tenets provide a backdrop for the Army’s unit training principles (see ADP 7 0). The overarching tenets are— z Strong commitment by the Army, superiors, and individuals to developing leaders. z Clear purpose and intention for what, when, and how to develop leadership. z Supportive relationships and culture of learning. z Three mutually supportive domains (institutional, operational, and self-development) that enable education, training, and experiences. z Providing, accepting, and acting on candid assessment and feedback for self-awareness. 1-7. The Army prioritizes developing its people beyond a directed responsibility to develop subordinates. AR 600-100 directs Army leaders to develop their subordinates. Leaders must commit to developing others and themselves; Members want to serve in an organization that values camaraderie and teamwork while improving others’ capabilities. accountability for implementation follows responsibility. 1-8. Development occurs through both formal systems and informal practices. Reception and integration, newcomer training, developmental tasks and assignments, individual and collective training, educational events, transition or succession planning, and broadening are all activities where development occurs and should be encouraged. Development in the three mutually supportive domains (institutional, operational, and self-development) involves experiential learning that is consistent with the principle of train as you fight. Any experience that shapes and improves performance enhances development. Emphasizing any developmental domain at another’s expense hinders learning. 1-9. Feedback is necessary to guide and gauge development. Formal and informal feedback based on observation and assessment provide information to confirm or increase self-awareness about developmental progress. The Army established performance monitoring, evaluation reports, coaching, growth counseling processes, and self-awareness assessments to engage leaders and individuals. Feedback that goes from leader to led is essential for learning along with other feedback sources to develop leaders. Forming a mentoring or coaching relationship outside unit lines is a means to obtain informal feedback. Another is the feedback leaders obtain though self-assessments, study to improve, and application of knowledge or skills. 1-10. Development depends on having clear purpose for why, what, when and how to develop. Good leader development is purposeful and goal oriented. A clearly established purpose enables leaders to guide, assess, and accomplish development. The principles for developing leaders describe goals for what leaders need to be developed to do: lead by example, develop subordinates, create a positive environment for learning, exercise mission command, adaptive performance, critical and creative thinking, and know subordinates and their families. The core leader competencies and attributes identified in ADP 6-22 provide additional detail on what leaders need to be, know, and do. 1-11. Developing leaders includes holding subordinates accountable for maintaining Army standards, demonstrating the leadership requirements model competencies and attributes, adhering to Army Values, and accomplishing missions.Leaders must consider each situation and select the best approach to hold subordinates accountable. Sometimes, a private verbal correction is adequate, in others, where time or safety Developing Leaders 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 1-3 are paramount, a public correction commensurate with the seriousness of the situation is warranted. In others, written counseling provides a reference for future professional development. Setting expectations in a unit about how and why leaders hold subordinates accountable is itself a means of developing leaders. It ensures shared understanding on effective leader requirements and unit standards, ultimately growing better leaders and maintaining positive command climates. LEADERSHIP REQUIREMENTS 1-12. The Nation and the Army articulate their expectations of Army leaders through the Army leadership requirements model (see figure 1-1) that illustrates expectations of every leader, whether military or civilian, officer or enlisted, active or reserve. It covers the core leader requirements and expectations of all leadership levels. Attributes are the desired internal leader characteristics—what the Army wants leaders to be and know. Competencies are skills and behaviors the Army expects leaders to acquire, demonstrate, and continue to enhance—what the Army wants leaders to do. 1-13. A clear leadership requirements framework provides leaders the basis to assess their strengths and developmental needs and to determine goals for improvement. The Army’s leadership requirements model specifically provides leaders with enduring attributes and competencies. The model provides a consistent reference point throughout professional and personal development progression. Leaders must improve in all the leader competencies, become more knowledgeable about the way the military operates, and understand how to operate in complex geopolitical situations. Figure 1-1. Leadership requirements model (ADP 6-22) 1-14. As Army leaders develop themselves and others, they must guard against counterproductive leadership behaviors. The leadership requirements model identifies what leaders need to develop; counterproductive leadership identifies where leaders may need correction as they develop. As future operational environments will be increasingly complex, it is imperative to identify and counteract anything that prevents mission success. Counterproductive leadership is the demonstration of leader behaviors that violate one or more of the Army's core leader competencies or Army Values, preventing a climate conducive to mission accomplishment (ADP 6-22). Counterproductive leadership has long-term negative effects on individuals and units, impeding mission accomplishment and negating combat advantages. Chapter 1 1-4 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU 1-15. Counterproductive leadership tends to fall into several categories: abusive, self-serving, erratic, leadership incompetence, and corrupt (see ADP 6-22 for complete descriptions). All leaders are susceptible to counterproductive leadership, especially during stress, high operating tempo, or other chaotic conditions. Left uncorrected, the negative effects can quickly cascade, lowering morale, commitment, cohesion, performance, readiness, and mission accomplishment. 1-16. Counterproductive leadership is complex and must be handled in an effective and constructive way that does not lead to further problems. Table 1-1 provides questions to identify, assess, and address counterproductive leadership. Training modules are available on the CAPL website. Table 1-1. Questions to focus approach dealing with counterproductive leadership Identify What is the behavior? What category does it fit in? Assess What conditions and factors influence the behavior(s)? Define the situation, actors, behaviors, and behavior impact. Is there a pattern to the behaviors? Address What strategies (intervening for others, directly addressing, or strengthening resilience) should be employed to address or cope with the behavior? DEVELOPING COHESIVE AND EFFECTIVE TEAMS 1-17. The Army relies on effective teams to perform tasks, achieve objectives, and accomplish missions. Building and maintaining teams that operate effectively is essential. To do this, Army leaders employ Army team building, a continuous process of enabling a group of people to reach their goals and improve their effectiveness through leadership and various exercises, activities, and techniques. Figure 1-2 outlines the Army team building process. Figure 1-2. Army team building process model 1-18. Three qualities characterize good teamwork: climate, identity, and cohesion. Climate refers to how members think and feel about their organization, based on shared perceptions and attitudes. It depends on the personalities within a unit, which change as people come and go. Team identity develops through a shared understanding of what the team exists to do and what the team values. Cohesion is the unity or togetherness across team members and forms from mutual trust, cooperation, and confidence. Teamwork increases when teams operate in a positive, engaging, and emotionally safe environment. An engaging environment occurs where team members desire to work together on missions; they feel a sense of self-worth and accomplishment Developing Leaders 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 1-5 of something more important than they are. A safe environment occurs when team members feel they can be open and not threatened by unwarranted criticism. 1-19. Teamwork fosters open communication, improves professional relations, contributes to unit motivation, and builds trust. Teamwork pulls together a diverse groups’ knowledge and experience to accomplish the mission. Knowing the elements of effective teams and developing teamwork assists leaders to assemble the team, orient them, create an identity, cultivate trust, engage in solving problems, manage processes, regulate team dynamics, and deliver results to other organizations and stakeholders. High performing teams enforce high standards and hold each other accountable for their actions including their performance or output level. Table 1-2 compares effective and ineffective teams’ characteristics. See ATP 6-22.6 for specific techniques. Table 1-2. Characteristics of effective and ineffective teams Effective Teams Ineffective Teams Emphasize commonalities among members rather than characteristics that cause subgroups to form. Hold a shared vision about operating as a team. Share useful information with other team members. Ensure team members join group activities (such as sports, meals, or other off-duty activities). Act quickly to promote togetherness when schisms in the group appear or morale drops. Show appreciation and concern for team members. Act as a team instead of individuals; take pride in team accomplishments. Fail to listen to relevant team member input. Speak disparagingly about other members. Fail to enforce or encourage discipline in the team. Compete, rather than cooperate, with other team members. Argue over petty or trivial matters. Fail to act or decide on issues that have implications for the team. Focus more on self-interest than team well-being. Give less than full effort due to low morale or lack of confidence in other team members. GROWTH ACROSS LEADERSHIP LEVELS AND BY COHORTS 1-20. The Army develops officers, at all levels, to understand and practice the mission command principles to lead and conduct military operations to support unified land operations. The Army expects officers to integrate developmental practices with collective and individual training to accomplish the Army’s missions and develop subordinates for future responsibilities. They routinely operate at direct-level interactions with others and work at the organizational and strategic levels to plan, prepare, execute, and assess policies, systems, and practices. Warrant officers serve at all echelons as the primary specialized experts, integrators, managers, and trainers who operate, maintain, administer, and supervise the Army’s equipment, support activities, and technical systems and processes in accordance with their primary career field. They bring an unequalled depth of knowledge, experience, leadership, and perspective to operations. Warrant officers, at all echelons, understand and practice the mission command principles to execute unified land operations. See DA PAM 600-3 for developmental opportunities throughout an officer’s career. 1-21. NCOs are responsible for setting and maintaining high-quality standards and discipline while conducting daily missions making decisions based on disciplined initiative derived from commanders' intent. NCOs serve as standard-bearers and role models vital to training, educating, and developing subordinates. Through training, coaching, mentoring, counseling, and informal interaction, NCOs guide Soldier development every day and play a role in developing junior officers. NCOs advise officers at all levels and are an important source of knowledge, experience, and discipline for all enlisted matters. See DA PAM 600- 25 for professional development opportunities. 1-22. DA Civilians provide crucial continuity and leadership to complement Soldiers’ roles. DA Civilian leaders require a broad understanding of military, political, and business-related strategies, as well as managerial, leadership, and decision-making skills. DA Civilians develop other DA Civilians and support military leader development as supervisors, mentors, and instructors. DA Civilians should understand and exercise the mission command principles while providing mission-based capabilities to support Army missions. See Department of Defense (DOD) Instruction 1430.16 and AR 690-950 for specifics. Chapter 1 1-6 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Leader development by walking around—the continual face-to-face engagement by leaders during daily duties—is the most effective informal means of developing leaders at the platoon, company, battalion, and brigade level. TRANSITIONS ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL LEVELS 1-23. Continual learning and development are the cornerstone for creating and sustaining an agile Army. Through activities in the institutional, operational, and self-development domains, personnel obtain education, training, and experiences to grow and succeed at positions of greater responsibility. As Army leaders progress in leadership responsibilities, it is necessary for them to develop new skills and abilities to refine how they will lead at the next level. 1-24. The timing of development is especially important because personnel join and move through a series of alternating and progressive education, training, and operational experiences. The approach applies to DA Civilians as well; however, federal service does not program advancement opportunities for most positions. DA Civilians move across positions based on the governing regulations and laws relating to applying for and filling positions. Ideally, the best direct-level leaders are developed into organizational level leaders and ultimately into strategic and enterprise level leaders. 1-25. In addition to the leadership requirements model, leaders must grow in their ability to understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead, and assess under differing conditions changing at each leadership level. As leaders progress, they experience greater challenges based on the situation’s scope, the consequences and risks involved, and the time horizon. As scope increases, the number of people and outside parties involved increases. The consequences of decisions increase, as do the risks that leaders must address. The length of time that leaders’ decisions apply tend to increase at higher levels as well as the time over which leaders can apply influence. 1-26. Career transitions can be difficult, regardless of performance and potential at prior levels. When moving into new roles with different demands, individuals may not perform at a previous high level. Individuals must have a developmental mindset to improve what is within their capability and be motivated to do their best. Their leaders have a responsibility to develop the capability. The Army endorses a culture where individuals continually strive to learn, broaden personal skills, and improve. 1-27. The required attributes and the expected competencies leaders perform do not change. However, some attributes and skills become more important in certain positions based on leader level and responsibilities (see transition descriptions). Proficiency levels regarding leader performance are specific to the individual leader, not their age, rank, cohort, or assigned position. Leaders of all ability levels should take advantage of opportunities to improve. The true nature of the Army leadership attributes and competencies is that there is no ultimate quality level to reach. Regardless of their capability, leaders are always able to learn more— increasing their adaptability, versatility, and effectiveness when influencing others and improving their organizations. 1-28. For military leaders, six leadership levels span the full range of Army organizations. The changes across levels correspond to the growth of responsibility, increase in the number of personnel affected, and the stakes involved. Not all levels and transitions apply to all organizational cohorts, military fields, or functions and some Army positions do not fit neatly into this transitions model. Similar transition points exist for DA Civilians, each requiring progressive responsibility levels. Personnel begin by managing themselves. Leading and preparing self is constant through the entire process no matter where one enters and exits the leadership continuum. Self-management and self-preparation are important steps in preparing for initial leader responsibilities. Six transitions that may apply to leaders in Army organizations are– z Leading at the direct level. Initial-entry Soldiers and DA Civilians transition from a focus on self to providing direct leadership to others to accomplish missions. Junior leaders learn how to plan daily tasks and activities, understand organizational constructs, and interact with subordinates, peers, and superiors. z Leading organizations. The second transition occurs with leaders at the organizational level. This level begins at company, battery, troop, staff, and similar organization levels for DA Civilians. Developing Leaders 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 1-7 Direct level leadership still occurs at this level, but the leaders become leaders of leaders and rarely perform individual tasks, unless they serve in undermanned organizations or an emergency. Coaching subordinate, direct-line leaders and setting a positive example as a leader are two characteristics that stand out at this level. z Leading functions. The third transition is from leading an organization (as a leader of direct-line leaders) to leading functions. This level involves directing functions beyond a single individual’s experience path. Key characteristics are operating with other leaders of leaders and adopting a longer-term perspective. Functional leaders typically include majors, mid-level warrant officers, and mid-level NCOs. z Leading integration. A fourth transition occurs when leaders assume command and leadership responsibility for battalion and similar-sized generating force organizations. These leaders must become more adept at establishing and communicating a vision and deciding on goals and mission outcomes. They need to find time for reflection and analysis and value the importance of making trade-offs between future goals and current needs. Positive attitudes related to trust, accepting advice, and accepting feedback pays dividends at this level and into the future. z Leading large organizations. A fifth transition occurs at the brigade-equivalent and higher levels of operational and institutional organizations. They often operate outside their experience paths while leading others operating beyond theirs as well. Leaders will only be successful by valuing others’ expertise and success. Humility is a desired characteristic of organizational and strategic leaders who should recognize that others have specialized expertise indispensable to success. A modest view of one's own importance underscores an essential element to foster cooperation across organizations. Even the humblest person needs to guard against an imperceptible ego inflation when constantly exposed to high levels of attention and opportunities. z Leading the enterprise. A final step occurs in the transition to serving as an enterprise leader. Enterprise leaders must be long-term, visionary thinkers who spend considerable time interacting with agencies beyond the military. This leader must be willing to relinquish control of enterprise elements to strategic and junior-level leaders. This page intentionally left blank. 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-1 Chapter 2 Fundamentals of Development 2-1. The development fundamentals simplify and span the formal leader development activities, such as assessing, counseling, coaching, mentoring, broadening, and team building. The fundamentals are common across formal and informal development activities that may overlap with training goals and serve to reinforce a developmental culture and mindset. Other sources provide guidance on techniques associated with the formal activities, such as AR 623-3 on the evaluation process, AR 621-7 and DA PAM 600-3 on broadening assignments, ATP 6-22.1 on the counseling process, and ATP 6-22.6 on team building. 2-2. Leadership requires establishing interpersonal relationships based on trust and setting the example for everyone––subordinates, peers, and superiors. In leader development surveys, leaders ranked leading a unit, personal examples, and mentoring as the three most effective ways to develop their leadership skills. Experience is a powerful learning tool; however, learning from experience is not guaranteed. As the tenets for developing leaders convey, learning requires commitment and purpose. Learning occurs after reflecting on experiences. This chapter covers setting the conditions for development, gathering and providing feedback, reflection and study, and creating opportunities for continued experiential learning. 2-3. The following sections focus on the fundamentals of developing leaders (see figure 2-1): z Setting conditions for development. z Providing feedback on a leader’s actions. z Enhancing learning through mentoring, training, reflection, and study. z Creating opportunities and evaluating effectiveness.Figure 2-1. Fundamentals of developing leaders SECTION I–SETTING CONDITIONS 2-4. Leaders create the conditions for a developmental culture and build a learning environment to allow subordinates to learn from their own experiences and the experiences of those around them. Setting Conditions has two vital components— z Establishing a learning environment by encouraging and challenging subordinates to take reasonable risks, grow, and develop on their own initiative. z Gaining knowledge of subordinates’ unique skills, abilities, backgrounds, and goals. Chapter 2 2-2 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU ESTABLISHING A LEARNING ENVIRONMENT 2-5. Leaders set the conditions for development by performing their tasks and missions in ways that inform subordinates throughout the organization that leader development is important. Be receptive to individual input, recommendations, and advice. Good leaders back subordinates trying to do the right thing and learn something new at the same time. Stop those who belittle suggestions to take a different or creative approach. A positive climate encourages a learning environment. 2-6. Being a role model—setting the example—for development is essential. Leaders who model investing in development send the message that leader development is a priority. Table 2-1 provides elements and questions for consideration to assess an organization. Table 2-1. Elements and questions to assess an organization To... Ask... Encourage development Are you actively and directly engaged in developing others? Are leaders visibly present and actively engaged in developing others? Are leaders inspiring others through genuine concern for their growth? Are leaders readily available to provide guidance and answer questions? Do leaders designate and protect time for leader development and mentorship? Encourage learning Do leaders feel free to ask themselves what went right and wrong in planning and executing an operation? Is there tolerance for discussing mistakes? Do others observe you engaged in learning? Do you develop yourself? Are you prepared to meet mission challenges as they arise? Do you actively listen to others? Are followers encouraged to provide candid feedback? Do you create a positive environment? Do you enjoy being a leader? Does your example motivate subordinates to emulate you? Do you develop subordinates? Do you know their strengths, developmental needs, goals, and life activities that extend beyond the workday? Are you serving as a teacher and mentor? Do leaders use available resources for development (such as reading lists, assessment programs, leader professional development programs)? Promote learning from mistakes When mistakes occur, is the focus on assigning blame or on why the mistakes occurred and how to reduce a reoccurrence? Do you avoid criticizing individuals publicly? Do you speak openly about personal leadership mistakes and lessons learned? Encourage effective decision-making Are leaders well informed when they make important decisions? Do they consider and understand the relevant consequences for Soldiers, DA Civilians, and the mission? Encourage innovation through diversity and accepting risks Are leaders restricted to operating strictly according to standing operating procedures? Do leaders dismiss new ideas in favor of prior practices? Do you promote innovation and diversity in teams? Can leaders debate with you, exchange issues, or challenge each other’s perspectives? Do you create teams with unique and diverse backgrounds to address novel viewpoints, ideas, and different opinions? Allow for risk taking and encourage exercising disciplined initiative Do you set boundaries or prioritize areas where subordinates can take risk? Is it clear what is or is not acceptable? Are leaders willing to accept challenges in unit performance that come with new ideas? Do you show empathy? Do you consider others’ situations relating to their challenges? How much authority and autonomy can you delegate to your subordinates? How much authority and autonomy can they responsibly delegate to their subordinates? How frequently do you need updates to inform decisions? Does the update frequency create the perception of distrust? Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-3 TECHNIQUES FOR CREATING CONDITIONS PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT 2-7. Subtle actions on the leader’s part build trust and communicate the role of trainer and developer. Experienced leaders use several techniques to create a developmental culture: z A leader should be present to observe enough key activities without overwhelming subordinates. After initial observations, give the observed leader time and space to exercise leadership without being in the spotlight. This helps establish the leader’s role as a supportive resource rather than an evaluative note taker. It builds trust, self-confidence, and creativity in the follower. z As often as possible, leaders should employ an indirect approach. Start by providing observation descriptions along with positive and negative outcomes. Allow the subordinate to understand what is going well and what needs improvement. The opposite of an indirect approach is to micromanage and be overly prescriptive, outlining specifics for completion. z Give each leader a fresh, objective start. Compare subordinates against objective standards. Avoid subjective comparisons to past leaders or units (including personal experiences). The bottom line is to observe and assess each leader on individual merit. Avoid thinking of the observation process as a means to grade leaders. Mistakes occur in all organizations and operational environments. Leaders foster a learning environment by acknowledging that honest mistakes come with challenging missions. Tell leaders about a risky, challenging mission. Recount the mistakes made in trying to accomplish it. Wrap up the discussion with the lessons learned from the experience. LEARNING PRINCIPLES 2-8. Development is a change process. Applying learning principles throughout development accelerates and improves learning. Table 2-2 presents principles to promote effective, efficient, and appealing learning. Table 2-2. Learning principles Principles How each principle works to encourage development Being task- or problem-centered Learners are engaged in solving real-world problems. Real situations engage the learner to think and act in ways that are relevant to future outcomes. Activation Knowledge the learner already has serves as a foundation for new knowledge. Demonstration New knowledge is demonstrated to the learner. Application The learner applies new knowledge. Repetition and practice across varying conditions enhances application—interaction with role models and mentors, feedback and reflection, and studying other leaders. Integration New knowledge is integrated into the learner’s world. 2-9. These principles are compatible with and supportive of learning that occurs while completing duties, practical exercises, or collective training. Opportunities that challenge the individual and encourage learning enhance development. Learning best occurs when the interest area has real-world relevance, and the learner can synthesize new insights or create new knowledge. 2-10. Purposeful learning starts when learners are challenged to know more and do better. Purposeful learning occurs when practice at mastery of tasks and skills are integrated into leaders’ day-to-day activities. Applying the learning principles results in leaders who actively engage in learning, quickly retain and recall information, and transfer learning to novel situations. Chapter 2 2-4 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Incorporating Developmental Opportunities When assessing her company’s performance from the previous week during the battalion training meeting, CPT Williams asserts that Alpha Company’s squad cohesion is not where it needs to be for the company to advance to platoon collective training. Clearly frustrated, CPT Williams suggests to the battalion commander, LTC Cano, that last quarter’s red cycle tasks and summer transitions prevented leaders from developing their Soldiers, teams, and squads. Her first sergeant and fellow command teams nod their heads in agreement. LTC Cano: “I understand your frustration, but we cannot allow high operating tempo and Soldier turnover to interfere with our principal obligation as leaders: developing our subordinates. Installation taskings, reception, and farewelling departing teammates are all developmental opportunities and activities that should enhance cohesion.” CSM Baker: “That’s true sir, but I’m not sure our battalion unit training plan adequately reflects the deliberate and continuous process that is fundamental to developing leaders. The current plan implies leader development is just something we do in a classroom once per quarter.” LTC Cano: “Fair assessment sergeant major. MAJ Blank, you and I will review the battalion training plan this week. I want to ensure each event includes leader development objectives linked to the Army’s leadership requirements model.” GAINING KNOWLEDGE OF SUBORDINATES 2-11. For effective leader development, individual relationships with each subordinate are necessary. Leaders who routinely interact with subordinates understand their subordinates’ backgrounds and experiences better. This enables discovery of special skills and experiences to support specific missions. Getting to know subordinates communicates a genuine interest in them as individuals, builds confidence, and generates trust. Trust is key to having candid talks with leaders about their developmental needs. TEAM TRUST AND UNIT COHESION 2-12. Creating a positive climate that encourages learning contributes to all development aspects. Subordinates have to be receptive, engaged, and ready to develop. Leaders should be aware of subordinate’s individual needs when building rapport and offering feedback. Some individuals will need more; some will need less. Some individuals seek additional attention and feedback while some will want less. 2-13. The objective of engaging with subordinates is to listen to their responses and understand their situation. Build rapport by sharing something about yourself. Early in interactions with subordinates, briefly share personal experiences—including areas of specialized expertise and areas of less experience. 2-14. In certain circumstances, using social media to observe and share ideas may be beneficial. Accepting an invitation to connect with a subordinate or allow a subordinate to follow your social media requires forethought. Social media platforms allow subordinates to observe how leaders align their words and deeds and allow leaders to observe and engage with subordinates about life events during and after service. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-5 Sharing Experiences Learning from others’ experiences can be invaluable. Provide opportunities for leaders to share and discuss their experiences in terms of the leader competencies (see ADP 6-22). Choose a competency (see table 4-5). Discuss the behaviors that support it. Describe a time someone demonstrated the behavior well. What actions did they take? What was the outcome? What makes this a good demonstration of the competency? Describe a situation where someone did not demonstrate the competency but could have. What actions did they take? What was the outcome? What actions would have been more effective? INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEWS 2-15. Counseling and feedback provide clear, timely, and accurate information concerning individual performance compared to established standards. During professional growth counseling and feedback sessions, leaders should help subordinates identify individual strengths and developmental needs to design an individual development plan (IDP), a tool primarily used by the individual subordinate to document short- and long-term goals for career and personal development. All individuals are responsible for developing and maintaining their IDP. Leaders gain better understanding of their subordinates by helping them refine their IDP for an individualized approach to professional development. Likewise, individuals and leaders should understand that preparing an IDP does not solve all development issues—the form only documents and guides the necessary actions to reach the specified goals while employing strengths and addressing needs. Reserve Component IDPs should include career development goals that balance Army careers with civilian careers. Chapter 2 2-6 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Integrating Individual Development Plans COL Jones and CSM Hart are conducting their daily closeout meeting after the brigade mission analysis brief for an upcoming combined arms live fire exercise. COL Jones: “Sergeant major, I’ve noticed a trend during our brigade train up that suggests our leaders at echelon are having trouble anticipating risks and opportunities in our large-scale combat operation training scenarios.” CSM Hart: “That is interesting sir. Where are these trends coming from?” COL Jones: “I had our battalion commanders analyze their subordinates’ IDPs to help us identify our strengths and weaknesses. They briefed their analysis during the latest training brief. Our leaders self-identified mental agility as an attribute they considered a developmental need. Also, you and I have observed that our leaders need more training reps to teach them what future tasks and resources to anticipate in combat.” CSM Hart: “Well sir, if we identify these needs early in exercise planning it will give us some options. We could conduct a formal professional development session for the brigade, but I doubt we have the space available in the unit training plan to adequately address these dynamic developmental needs. Another option is to be deliberate with exercise planning to incorporate these specific developmental needs as part of your training objectives.” COL Jones: “That’s a great idea sergeant major. Let’s meet with MAJ Price tomorrow to brainstorm some ways to induce critical thinking to our leaders during training.” COL Jones and CSM Hart met with MAJ Price to adjust the exercise scenario and training objectives to purposefully challenge, evaluate, and provide feedback on leaders’ ability to think critically and anticipate environmental changes. COL Jones used his opening comments prior to the course of action brief to update the battalion command teams on his intent to develop leaders. SECTION II–PROVIDING FEEDBACK 2-16. Leaders need to learn how to observe subordinates and provide developmental feedback. Using several assessment and feedback methods provides a robust and more accurate picture of the individual and provides better developmental opportunities. 2-17. A leader’s ability to provide feedback to subordinates significantly contributes to their development. It enhances and accelerates learning from the day-to-day work experience—the most valued and effective environment for development. Feedback can reinforce (through recognition or praise) or change or eliminate (such as correction, constructive criticism, or alternative approaches) behaviors. 2-18. Timely, accurate feedback translates into better leader performance, which in turn, has a positive effect on unit performance and mission success. Providing accurate feedback starts with planned observation and accurate observation and assessment. OBSERVATION PLANNING 2-19. The first step to having a role in a subordinate’s development process is to observe them. To use available time productively, plan to— z Observe them challenged by a developmental need. z Observe them excelling by applying a personal strength. z Observe their actions during critical times of unit performance. z Observe decision-making and conduct. z Observe their effect on subordinate leaders and Soldiers. z See them relaxed and available for conversation. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-7 Do not draw a lasting leader impression from a single observation. It usually takes several observations before a behavior pattern emerges. Take time to gather information from others observing the same leader, as different people focus on different aspects. ACCURATE AND DESCRIPTIVE OBSERVATIONS 2-20. Accurate, descriptive leadership observations are important to assess performance and provide feedback that produces focused learning. Assessing performance into developmental need, meets standard, and strength categories informs what needs development or sustainment and provides motivation to develop. These behavior indicators provide general performance measures for varying proficiency levels for the leader attributes and core leader competencies required of all Army leaders (see ADP 6-22). Understanding the behavior indicators and observation methods provides a strong base to provide others’ feedback, specifically when using formal tools such as DA Form 4856 (Developmental Counseling Form), DA Form 67-10-1A (Officer Evaluation Report Support Form), or DA Form 2166-9-1A (NCO Evaluation Report Support Form). 2-21. Observing leadership occurs by watching how a leader interacts with and influences others. Written directives, verbal communications, and leader actions all indicate how a leader performs. Raters learn about subordinates’ leadership by observing reactions among peers, subordinates, and other superiors. 2-22. The following performance indicators are grouped according to the leadership requirements model by leader attribute categories (character, presence, and intellect) and leader competency categories (lead, develop, and achieve). The performance indicators provide three proficiency levels: a developmental need, the standard, and a strength. For developmental purposes, these three categories are sufficient and apply across cohorts. A developmental need is identified as a specific need for development when the observed individual does not demonstrate the leader attribute or competency. Strength indicators are associated with successfully performing leader attributes or competencies. Strengths include a consistent pattern of natural talents, knowledge gained through learning, and skills acquired through practice and experience. 2-23. Tables 2-3 through 2-8 (see pages 2-6–2-11). illustrate a focus on core leadership characteristics. Army adoption of a core attribute and competency model means that no list comprehensively lists all performance requirements for any leader.Each rater, counselor, mentor, or trainer will need to address specific duty or functional requirements. They should be able to apply the ideas to specific performance objectives designated for individuals that exceed the core leadership requirements. 2-24. While comparing observations against the leader performance indicators, determine the observed leader’s proficiency level: first review the behavior that appears in the center column, which represents the standard for leader performance. The column on the left describes performance indicating a strength (individual exceeds the standard), while the column to the right describes performance indicating a developmental need (individual does not meet the standard). 2-25. Understanding the competencies and attributes in the Army leadership requirements model is essential to make careful and accurate observations of a subordinate’s performance and evaluation of potential. Leader attributes are inward characteristics that shape the motivations for actions and bearing, and how thinking affects decisions and interactions with others. Attributes support a leader’s development and effective performance. The core leader competencies apply across all leadership levels while subtle changes occur in purpose and activity at each level and include how Army leaders lead people; develop themselves, subordinates, and organizations; and achieve the mission. They are what the Army expects of all leaders and are the most outwardly visible leader performance signs. CHARACTER 2-26. Character is a person’s true nature comprised of their morals, virtues, values, conscious and sense of purpose, which make up their core and are the mindset and moral foundation behind actions and decisions. Leaders of character adhere to the Army Values, display empathy, the Warrior Ethos/Service Ethos, humility, and practice good discipline. See table 2-3 on page 2-8. Chapter 2 2-8 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Table 2-3. Framing character STRENGTH STANDARD DEVELOPMENTAL NEED ARMY VALUES Models loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. Promotes the associated principles, standards, and qualities in others. Consistently demonstrates loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. Inconsistently demonstrates loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, or personal courage. Demonstrates frequent lapses in judgment. EMPATHY Attentive to others’ views and concerns. Personally acts to improve situations for Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians, Family members, local community, or even potential adversaries. Models empathy for others. Demonstrates an understanding of another person’s viewpoint. Identifies with others’ feelings and emotions. Displays desire to care for Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians, and others. Exhibits resistance or limited perspective on others’ needs. Communicates indifference or lack of understanding. Unapproachable; disinterested in personally caring for Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians, or others. WARRIOR ETHOS/SERVICE ETHOS Models the spirit of the Warrior Ethos. Instills this behavior in subordinates and others. Demonstrates the spirit of the Warrior Ethos. Inconsistently demonstrates the Warrior Ethos; downplays its importance. Fails to do what is right. DISCIPLINE Demonstrates discipline in personal performance. Encourages others to follow good practices of discipline as well. Enforces discipline when others fail to adhere to Army Values or other standard practices. Demonstrates control of personal behavior according to Army Values. Adheres to the orderly practice of completing duties of an administrative, organizational, training, or operational nature. Fails consistently to adhere to rules, regulations, or standard operating procedures. HUMILITY Understands they are part of a larger organization and works toward something more important than themselves. Demonstrates confidence, competence, and a willingness to seek out feedback from others. Willing learner who demonstrates accurate self-awareness. Presents as meek, timid, or passive (under-expression) or as overconfident and arrogant (over- expression). Unaware of personal abilities and limitations. PRESENCE 2-27. Presence is the impression a leader conveys to others through their appearance, demeanor, actions, and words. Leaders with presence demonstrate military and professional bearing, fitness, confidence, and resilience. See table 2-4 on page 2-9. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-9 Table 2-4. Framing presence STRENGTH STANDARD DEVELOPMENTAL NEED MILITARY AND PROFESSIONAL BEARING Models a professional image of authority. Commanding presence energizes others. Exemplifies adherence to standards through appearance, demeanor, actions, and words. Possesses a commanding presence. Projects a professional image of authority. Demonstrates adherence to standards. Inconsistently projects a professional image of authority. Allows professional standards to lapse in personal appearance, demeanor, actions, and words. FITNESS Sets a personal example in both the physical and non-physical readiness domains. Strength and endurance support emotional health and conceptual abilities under prolonged stress. Energetic attitude conveys importance of fitness to others and fosters an environment conducive to changing the culture of health and fitness in the Army. Displays sound health, strength, and endurance that support emotional health and conceptual abilities under prolonged stress. Fitness combines both the physical and non-physical domains of holistic health and fitness that contribute to individual readiness to perform duties well in any environment. Physical health, strength, or endurance is not sufficient to complete most missions. Fitness level unable to support emotional health and conceptual abilities under prolonged stress due to a lack of readiness in the non- physical domains of holistic health and fitness (nutrition, mental, spiritual, and sleep). CONFIDENCE Projects self-confidence and inspires confidence in others. Models composure, an outward calm, and control over emotions in adverse situations. Manages personal stress and supports others experiencing stress. Displays composure, confidence, and mission-focus under stress. Effectively manages emotions and remains in control of emotions when situations become adverse. Inconsistently displays composure or a calm presence. Allows a setback to derail motivation. Displays a less than professional image of self or unit. RESILIENCE Quickly recovers from setbacks. Focuses on the mission and objectives during shock, injuries, and stress.

Recovers from setbacks, shock, injuries, adversity, and stress while maintaining a mission and organizational focus. Slowly recovers from adversity or stress. Inconsistently maintains a mission or organizational focus after a setback. INTELLECT 2-28. 2-28.Intellect is comprised of a leader’s brainpower and knowledge that enables them to think creatively and critically to gain situational understanding, make sound judgments, solve problems, and act. Intellect allows leaders to reason analytically, critically, ethically, and with cultural sensitivity. Leaders with high intellect are mentally agile, good at judgment, innovative, tactful around others, and expert in technical, tactical, cultural, geopolitical, and other relevant knowledge areas.

Leaders achieve by getting results as it relates to actions of leading to accomplish tasks and missions on time and to standard. Leaders get results by requiring the right integration of tasks, roles, resources, and priorities to achieve the desired outcomes. See table 2-8 on page 2-13. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-13 Table 2-8.

Monitors, coordinates, and regulates subordinate actions but allows subordinates to accomplish the work. Demonstrates a limited understanding of supervising, managing, monitoring, and controlling priorities of work. Hasty prioritization and planning lead to incomplete guidance and direction. OBSERVATION EXECUTION 2-32. Effective commanders observe training, participate in operations, and interact with subordinates and their units. Peers, trainers, staff, and others can make accurate observations that contribute to assessment. Unit metrics do not always provide an accurate picture of leader impact. A unit can have ideal training or readiness statuses and a less-than-ideal leadership climate. Unlike readiness or training assessments, leadership assessments— z Speak to the leader behaviors that contributed to the unit’s performance. z Combine perception and reality, with reality best confirmed by multiple sources. z Occur through two-way communication between leader and the led. 2-33. Observing subordinates requires leaders to find a balance between being dispassionate in their observation and still being empathetic to their Soldiers. Subordinate leaders who know they are being watched may behave differently with their observing leaders around. Observation also requires emotional perception. Knowing when a subordinate is overwhelmed, nervous, not receptive, or frustrated is key to helping them through the development process. Observations should be accurate, descriptive, tied to a key event and accurately depict a behavior pattern without observer bias. ACCURATE, DESCRIPTIVE OBSERVATIONS 2-34. Observing behaviors occurs by watching how a leader interacts with and influences others. Observations focus on what was or was not done well and what to do differently. Written directives, verbal communications, and actions all provide indications of how a leader influences others. Leaders learn about their subordinate by observing the reactions of peers, subordinates, and superiors. The observer must also consider how to differentiate performance of a desired behavior, the ability and initiative shown to improve or engage in a desired behavior, and the extent and duration of effects that the behavior has on individual or unit performance. 2-35. Three key components ensure observations are accurate and descriptive: z Plan multiple observations around key events, but also observe routine operations. z Look for behavior patterns. z Record important observations immediately for use in performance and professional growth counseling and evaluations.  Use words that depict action.  Link to effects and outcomes. PLAN OBSERVATIONS AROUND KEY EVENTS 2-36. Key training events offer opportunities to demonstrate a considerable number of leadership competencies and attributes. Major training events require time to plan, prepare, execute, and assess. Therefore, an observer can interact with their subordinate throughout the event to offer insights and enable Chapter 2 2-14 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU corrections. Most training events are controlled environments with clear standards for execution, making it easier for an observer to structure feedback and additional event iterations, if necessary. 2-37. Training events also allow a unique opportunity for observers to see how a learning leader reacts to friction, frustration, and, in certain circumstances, failure. An observer can help the observed Soldier understand how successful and poor reactions to events affects unit and mission success. Additionally, training events can stop and restart as needed to allow an observed Soldier to immediately correct mistakes and address lessons from their observer. Knowing when to start, restart, or stop the event all together requires an observer to be familiar with the level of mental or emotional fatigue a Soldier can manage before they are no longer able to retain or adapt to new information. LOOK FOR BEHAVIOR PATTERNS 2-38. With time and frequent observation, leaders gain confidence and start to see a consistent behavior pattern. It is a judgment call as to when to consider an observation as a behavior pattern. To observe for patterns, note how often a leader exhibits the same behavior over time. The behavior frequency may indicate a pattern. If sufficient time has passed and the observer can predict the leader’s actions, then a behavior pattern has emerged. Be alert to changes in performance and causes for strengths, inconsistencies, or developmental needs. RECORD IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS 2-39. Important leadership observation details may be lost or be inaccurately recorded if not written down soon after they occur. A way to capture observations and assessment is to use a quick, accurate, and complete method to take notes that supports an effective feedback session such as using a situation, observation, associate and assess, and reinforce and recommend (SOAR) framework. SOAR elements are— z Situation—Describe the assessment situation and conditions. This should include the time, location, event, or other situation context. z Observation—Describe the leadership behaviors that the leader exhibits. z Associate and Assess—Identify and associate the competency or attribute that best describes the leader actions. z Reinforce and Recommend—Record how to reinforce the leader’s behavior through praise or correction. 2-40. Accurate and complete notes are useful when providing leaders with feedback. The SOAR format is one way that leaders can record observations; however, leaders might choose to use a different method that fits their own style and needs. Use words that depict action 2-41. A leader needs to describe what the subordinate is doing when they are leading. By writing down an observation using action words, the observer can tell a better story about all the other unseen circumstances surrounding behaviors, decisions, and actions. Writing an observation down as though writing a story provides a better picture for the observed Solider, who is often too wrapped up in the leading process (under observation) and may not see immediate feedback from others or actions. Link to effects and outcomes 2-42. Leaders and Soldiers in subordinate echelons feel the positive or negative consequences of a leader’s action. Leadership affects task or mission accomplishment. Understanding cause and effect for a subordinate leader’s actions and effects on a mission or unit is a complex process. Aligning all facts for feedback can delay the feedback process and requires experience and empathy to balance the need for facts and feedback. Leaders can undermine trust by providing an incorrect cause and effect to a subordinate, which undermines their willingness to continue learning to lead effectively. An observer-leader is obligated to seek the relevant contributing factors to events before providing feedback. While it is not always possible to see everything, coordination with other staff and trusted observers will fill in gaps necessary to provide richer feedback. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-15 FEEDBACK DELIVERY 2-43. When experienced leaders reflect on their own development, they place high importance on day-to- day, two-way communication with their senior leaders because they do the same with their subordinates. Feedback is less effective if a leader waits until a formal sit-down counseling session to provide feedback. Leaders should provide feedback as soon as possible after observing a particular leader behavior to encourage positive outcomes. 2-44. Day-to-day informal feedback makes sitting down with subordinates for developmental counseling much easier. This informal feedback develops a shared understanding of the subordinate’s strengths and developmental needs. Still, many leaders find it difficult to sit down with a subordinate to engage in developmental counseling. ATP 6-22.1 provides extensive guidelines on the counseling process. Providing feedback on every observed act, response, or behavior overwhelms a subordinate. Provide feedback based on established competencies and attributes. Focus feedback on a few key behaviors that, if changed, contributes the most to improved leader and unit performance. Having a focus for improvement motivates the subordinate to take action to change. Ask the observed leader for a self-assessment before providing personal views. Do this by first recounting back to the leader the situation and observation (the first two SOAR sections). Then ask the leader to provide an assessment and recommendation. This reinforces three important leader development principles: leader self-assessment and self-awareness, individual leader responsibility for development, and leader ownership of the recommendation. PREPARATION AND TIMING OF FEEDBACK DURING TRAINING 2-45. Before training starts, leaders should explain the feedback tool to the unit and its leaders and general feedback process expectations. Leaders should emphasize the feedback’s developmental nature. In preparing to give feedback, the observer sets several goals to ensure a successful outcome. An observer finds the best balance between gathering relevant facts that will provide context to the lesson but without overwhelming the learner with information. Organizing feedback using a pre-arranged feedback tool helps an observer keep to the relevant material and gives the receiver an idea of what to expect. By discussing feedback formats and expectations, a leader can ask their observer to focus observations on specific areas where they may feel uncertain or want to improve. Sharing control and expectations for a feedback event between the observer and leader increases the potential to listen and learn and decreases defensive or confrontational behavior. 2-46. The timing to discuss leadership observations can be critical and a deciding factor between whether perceiving a situation as evaluative or developmental. Ultimately, determining the appropriate time to deliver an observation is at the leader’s discretion. The observer should be prepared, calm, motivated to share observations, and be familiar with the conditions that make a leader comfortable with receiving and understanding feedback. If an observer is rushed and the leader is frustrated or angry, it may be advisable to delay feedback delivery. Use personal judgment to consider whether delivery should occur during action, at a break in action, at day’s end, or at event completion based on conditions. 2-47. Sometimes, leaders deliver observations as they occur or “during the action” feedback. This is especially true when pointing out to the leader those actions must occur in the moment to allow observation. However, do not disrupt the training exercise. 2-48. Find the right break in the action to deliver observations. This could be during a lull after a major event has occurred (a major success or a failure). Consider waiting until day’s end, especially if observations are lengthy and require discussion. To enable better collective learning, wait until after conducting the unit or team after action review (AAR). Then, deliver observations to the subordinate privately. This aligns observation delivery of the subordinate’s strengths and areas for improvement with those of the unit or team as identified in the AAR, assuming they are compatible. 2-49. If observation delivery is best done at the event completion, consider letting the subordinate set the time for the discussion. At a minimum, provide a “heads up” about a situation or circumstance to be Chapter 2 2-16 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU discussed. This allows the observed leader an opportunity to reflect and mentally prepare to listen and receive. This also allows an observer a chance to gather their thoughts, address their emotions, and ensure they have a complete understanding of the event’s results for the leader and unit. This approach reduces the likelihood the subordinate will be preoccupied, nervous, or defensive. OBSERVATION DELIVERY 2-50. It is important to plan how to deliver observations to a subordinate. The following delivery methods, when done correctly, provide a leader with an understanding of the effect behaviors have on consequences, all based on careful and planned observations. The two-way communication techniques used to deliver an observation should motivate subordinates to start acting in ways that improve leader and unit performance. 2-51. These steps represent an indirect approach to providing leadership observations. Once leaders are ready to discuss observations and reinforce and recommend actions, the following steps provide an effective framework for delivering observations and flow in a logical sequence— z Confirm the observed event being discussed. z Ask the leader for a self-assessment. z Clarify and agree on the results. z Add personal observation notes. Confirm the Situation 2-52. Start by orienting the subordinate’s attention to the observed situation. State the situation and clarify that the observation is about leadership. Reiterate the information recorded: “I’d like to discuss the actions you took in the battlefield simulation you just led with your staff.” [SOAR, Situation] Ask for a Self-Assessment 2-53. Ask the subordinate to assess the situation and personal leader actions. Guide questioning to the subordinate’s leadership during the event or situation. The subordinate’s response should match the leader’s assessment. If it does not, the leader should ask additional specific questions: z “How effective was the communication between you and the subordinates you were leading? And how could you tell?” [SOAR, Associate and Assess] z “What factors did you observe that may have contributed to miscommunication or a vague understanding among the troops?” [SOAR, Associate and Assess] Clarify and Come to an Agreement 2-54. Leaders confirm the subordinate either agrees with the assessment or acknowledges a difference in opinion if the subordinate does not share the assessment. Confirm agreement or acknowledgement before proceeding to the assessment, linkages, and observations: z “That is what I saw as well” z “Actually, in my observations I noted that you were directive in your message and didn’t ask for questions. Would you agree that this is the approach you took?” [SOAR, Observation] Add Your Observations 2-55. Leaders may include observations that the subordinate is not aware. Leaders build on what the subordinate has already said to increase personal self-awareness. Specific behaviors that affected the consequence or outcome include— z “Your assessment is correct. When you asked for other viewpoints, good information sharing followed.” [SOAR, Observation] z “It was clear some staff had differing opinions or other points to add, though the opportunity to share really didn’t arise.” [SOAR, Observation] Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-17 Giving Feedback in 60 Seconds or Less Regularly providing constructive feedback is important to ensure improved leader and unit performance. Opportunities to provide subordinates feedback are available each day. Review the conversation below for an example. Situation: LTC Smith, the battalion commander, observes a platoon live fire exercise AAR that CPT Phillips, a company commander, is conducting. After the brief, LTC Smith approaches CPT Philips. First, LTC Smith provides a brief situation description. “CPT Phillips, I was in the back of the room during the AAR. Let’s talk a minute.” Next, LTC Smith describes the leader behavior observed. “When I came in, SGT Jones was describing some friction during the transition from indirect to direct fires. You listened intently to the general descriptions and asked some probing questions to get more details.” CPT Phillips: “Yes sir, I want squad leaders to understand how important communication is during transitions on the battlefield.” Finally, LTC Smith provides specific, constructive feedback to reinforce the observed behavior. “That’s a great technique to ask a few questions to confirm what SGT Jones said. He said he had trouble identifying the conditions necessary to engage with direct fires. You noticed that. From the excitement in SGT Jones’s voice, I think he knew that as a leader he was in the right place to assist the platoon. If you had not probed for details, the outcome of that AAR may have been different. Keep up the good work.” WAYS TO FURTHER ENGAGE LEADERS 2-56. Leaders raise questions that prompt subordinates to think about how to act or respond.Leaders should ask for recommendations about how the subordinate will take better actions in the future, avoid problems, and take advantage of an opportunity. Here are some possible questions— z “How will you handle a similar situation next time?” [SOAR, transition to Reinforce and Recommend] z “What future steps can you take to avoid this outcome?” [SOAR, transition to Reinforce and Recommend] Reinforce—Validate a Strength 2-57. Once the leader and subordinate agree on the behaviors that contributed to a consequence and a recommendation for the future, the leader should provide reinforcement on what the subordinate is doing correctly. Here are some examples— z “Your influencing strategies are working for you, keep it up.” [SOAR, Reinforce and Recommend] z “Consider closing out staff meetings with opportunities for questions or discussion. Your pre- meeting planning and organizing is effective—you should continue that.” [SOAR, Reinforce and Recommend] Additional Tips for Providing Feedback 2-58. Consider these items when providing feedback: z Focus on the leader’s behavior and actions. z Identify what the leader has control over to change. z Use focused questions as a form of feedback to create discovery learning. z Allow leaders the opportunity to produce a recommendation to the observation. This promotes their taking ownership and responsibility for it. Chapter 2 2-18 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU z Be familiar with improvement actions described in chapter 4 and offer appropriate ones. Remind leaders that this source is available to guide development, including improving their understanding of positive and negative behaviors and underlying causes. LESSONS FROM DELIVERING OBSERVATIONS 2-59. Leaders should avoid delivering some kinds of feedback. Especially important to avoid are— z Vague and general ideas: “You are a good leader.” Instead, focus on specific, observed strengths. z Using absolutes or generalities, such as always or never: “You never follow-up after meetings.” Instead, give specific behavior examples. z Observations applied to general traits or the total person: “You’re an introvert.” Instead, focus on specific, observed actions. z Untimely feedback that the leader is unable to apply: “Two days ago you gave ambiguous instructions at the mission rehearsal.” If they are not able to do anything useful with the feedback, focus on the future rather than the past. 2-60. It is important for leaders to learn from observation delivery and realize it takes practice. It is helpful after an interaction for leaders to reflect on their delivery. Reflective questions include— z Was my subordinate receptive to what we discussed? z Based on my questions, how easily did they identify the behaviors that needed to change? z Did my subordinate ask for techniques or ideas on how to change or improve? z Is there agreement on the next development step and its timeframe? z Is there evidence that my subordinate is acting on the observations? 2-61. After delivering observations, leaders look for the next opportunity to observe the subordinate’s leadership. Then, gauge how well the subordinate received the observation, what steps the leader has taken to change behavior, and what effect the change is having on unit outcomes. SUBORDINATE RECEPTIVENESS TO FEEDBACK 2-62. Trust and a developmental culture are critical to ensuring receptiveness of leader observations. Leaders perceived as genuinely interested in helping subordinates develop tend to have subordinates who are more receptive to observations and feedback. 2-63. To gauge receptiveness, leaders must remain attuned to verbal and nonverbal cues. These may occur as verbal disagreement or resistance, or nonverbal gestures such as folded arms, rolling eyes, or lack of attentiveness. These cues can affect an observer by increasing their frustration with the feedback process. Refocus the subordinate and yourself by— z Reaffirming your feedback intent maximizes the subordinate’s capabilities to learn and lead. z Restating the intent of your observation as a chance for self-development—not personal judgment. z Reiterating what went well, noting growth and progress. z Ask why they might not be receptive. For instance, “It seems you disagree with what I am saying. Can you share what you are thinking?” 2-64. Sometimes, a subordinate does not respond to any feedback. When this occurs, the leader might determine if an underlying cause prevents a positive response. Ultimately, the responsibility for learning lies with the subordinate, but an effective leader ensures the best possible conditions are set for continued learning. Even in difficult situations, leaders use different techniques to gain the subordinate’s attention and create learning opportunities. 2-65. These are some ways to redirect a non-responsive subordinate— z Work with the subordinate leader’s subordinates and peers to ensure their actions do not affect the mission or teammate performance. Having teammates engaged and invested in making a leader better is a deliberate effort that must occur with sufficient time and resources to mitigate effects on others. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-19 z Use experience. Talk the situation over with other leaders skilled at observing leadership. Obtain their perspectives and ideas on how to work with non-responsive subordinates. SECTION III–ENHANCING LEARNING 2-66. Setting conditions and providing feedback and advice are two development fundamentals. Applying practices to enhance learning makes development more effective. Enhancing learning draws on the developmental value from learning opportunities. Learning from experience is enhanced by facilitating what the experience means. Understanding an experience requires interpreting the event to create personal understanding. This process requires observation, feedback, dialogue, and reflection. A leader-subordinate pair, coach, or mentor can use these four steps with a leader, any group, or adapted for an individual learner. This section focuses on how dialogue can bolster the reflection process and understanding. Chapter 3 addresses how an individual uses this learning process. At the individual level, experiential learning is learning while doing. At the organizational level, experiential learning is improving while doing. Experiential learning is consistent with the principle of train as you fight. 2-67. Practical approaches to enhance learning include leader role models, mentoring, guided discovery learning, and individual and group study. These practices are not scheduled events but are powerful ways to integrate and promote learning in the day-to-day organizational operations. 2-68. Because leaders vary in their skill and experience level, an effective way to learn is directly from unit role models. Positive role models exhibit leadership behaviors that others should emulate. The 5-Minute Shadow Bring in a subordinate to observe or participate in an aspect of work that will improve their abilities. To maximize the experience–– - Communicate the situation, decision, or issue. - Convey the importance of acting appropriately or making the right decision. - Describe possible consequences, second- and third-order effects. - Discuss the decision or actions and reasoning behind them. GUIDED DISCOVERY LEARNING TECHNIQUES 2-69. Guided discovery learning is an advanced technique that experienced leaders employ to help others learn. Leaders use the technique in coaching, counseling, and mentoring situations. Guided discovery learning is an indirect method that engages individuals to identify personal strengths and developmental needs, supported by a senior leader. Guided discovery learning is effective when–– z A learner effectively makes sense of incoming information and integrates it with their personal base of experience and knowledge of relevant doctrine. z A supervisor generally keeps the subordinate on track through direction, coaching, feedback, or modeling. 2-70. When appropriate, guided discovery learning is more effective than prescriptive methods where the leader prescribes problem solutions to a subordinate. Creating guided discovery learning options for a subordinate requires deliberate commitment from a leader to resource the learning experience, accept risk that they may learn a different lesson or learn at a different pace than the leader originally planned. Striking a balance between prescriptive methods and indirect methods requires a holistic understanding of how a particular Soldier learns and leads. 2-71. To facilitate effective guided discovery learning for subordinates, a leader ensures— z Subordinates have sufficient background knowledge, training, and tools to experiment and learn. z Sufficient time exists to experience failure, reset training conditions, and learn from the experience. z The organization has a permissive learning environment encouraging learning without judgment. Chapter 2 2-20 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU 2-72. Guided discovery learning techniques are an effective way to deliver leadership observations. These methods are commonly employed when developing subordinates’ leadership skills: z Positive reinforcement. z Open-ended questioning. z Multiple perspectives. z Scaling questions. z Cause and effect analysis. z Recovery from setbacks. z Experience. Positive Reinforcement 2-73. A leader’s first subordinate observations ought to focus on what they are doing right. Commenting on positive actions up front shows a commitment to balanced and fair observation. It builds confidence and confirms productive performance that accomplishes an objective. Open-ended Questioning 2-74. Asking open-ended questions gets subordinates thinking about the situation and their leadership pertaining to unit performance. Broad questions maximize the potential for discovery. Leaders may need to ask additional specific questions if the subordinate is not identifying issues that need attention. An advantage of this approach gives subordinates hints about what they may need to do differently yet allows them to discover the actual issue on their own. In this way, responsibility for evaluation is with the subordinate, as is ownership for fixing the situation. Open-ended questioning is useful when the leader has time to listen, reflect, and do something about the situation. Thus, the busiest part of mission planning or execution may not be the most appropriate time to ask an open-ended question. 2-75. Open-ended questioning is employed by— z Identifying the outcome for the leader to realize. z Asking general questions about factors related to that outcome. z Asking specific questions and providing hints until the leader connects the outcome with actions. z Listening closely to the leader’s response. z Confirming and reinforcing what is heard as an accurate assessment. z Probing further or offer outcome-based evidence if they are not accurately assessing the situation. Multiple Perspectives 2-76. Employing multiple perspectives helps a leader see the situation from another person’s perspective (or a different frame of reference). A complementary step to the decision-making process is to understand a problem and appreciate its complexities before seeking to solve it. Supervisors help subordinates reframe the current situation through open-ended questions or soliciting feedback from other stakeholders. 2-77. The purpose of multiple perspectives is to prompt subordinates to think creatively and innovatively in their approach. Leaders should use this technique when a subordinate appears stuck with a limited way of thinking or is unable to break away from a mental block. Scaling Questions 2-78. The scaling questions technique is useful in facilitating a leader’s self-understanding of how difficult or challenging a problem is in relative terms. It facilitates incremental improvement and helps one recognize that progress has occurred. Supervisors ask subordinates to use a 10-point scale (where 10 is highest or best and 1 is lowest or worst) to assess personal performance on an action or competency behavior. The subordinate could share what they could do differently to improve performance a point or two on the scale. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-21 Cause and Effect Analysis 2-79. Leader actions are often several layers or processes removed from their consequences. The cause-and- effect analysis is a method to identify the root (or original) cause of consequences and outcomes. 2-80. It is not always obvious to leaders how certain behaviors affect outcomes further down the line. Cause and effect analysis is important because a leader and unit will continue to experience a negative outcome until identifying and resolving the actual root cause. Many times, only subsequent effects (or symptoms) of a problem are addressed, leaving the root cause intact. 2-81. Leaders use cause and effect analysis to address shortcomings when limited time and capability exist. Identifying a root cause focuses on remedial actions to fix the problem and change the consequence. 2-82. Cause and effect analysis is facilitated through— z Asking “What (rather than why) causes it to happen?” Show consequences or outcome data. z Continuing to ask “What?” and “What else?” until identifying all causes. It helps to capture work on paper or a whiteboard. z Depicting the relationships between causes and effect. z Identifying which causes, if changed or isolated, would prevent the outcome or consequence reoccurring. z Identifying solutions or changes to implement without causing other negative outcomes or consequences to occur. z Coaching the leader on being proactive to avoid negative outcomes before they occur. Recovery from Setbacks 2-83. When a subordinate experiences a difficult situation, setback, or seemingly insurmountable challenge, a supervisory leader can help restore confidence and prevent conditions from deteriorating. Employing the following enables recovery from setbacks— z Reinforcing a strength—a leadership behavior they are performing well. z Helping the leader recognize that they are already successfully handling some part of the task. z Asking open-ended questions to increase situational awareness and probe for solutions. z Providing recommendations if or when the leader is unable to arrive at a suitable course of action. z Increasing the percentage of positive reinforcement and support relative to negative reinforcement. Experience 2-84. By virtue of position and experience, a leader often knows something is going right or wrong before the subordinate knows it. It is an art to know when to impart aspects of that experience to a subordinate. Learning can occur by providing leaders with hints, well short of full understanding. 2-85. Leaders should carefully weigh the pros and cons of providing a subordinate with hints during training exercises. It is important to allow situations and events to unfold without premature intervention. If the leader provides information or solutions to the subordinate too soon, the situation’s development value diminishes, as ambiguous or adverse situations compel leaders to adapt and problem-solve on their own. 2-86. Yet, leaders do not want to hold on to information that may inhibit learning during the exercise. Without hints, a subordinate may experience a situation and its consequences, but not effectively learn from it. With hints and additional information, the subordinate launches on a learning expedition while the situation is still evolving. The inquisitive subordinate will follow up on the leader’s hints and find out why systems or people did not perform to expectations, a valuable learning expedition. COACHING 2-87. Coaching is a development technique used for a skill, task, or specific behaviors. Coaching helps another individual or team through a set of tasks or with improving personal qualities. A coach gets the person or team to understand their current level of performance and guides their performance to the next level. A Chapter 2 2-22 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU central coaching task is to link feedback interpretation with developmental actions. Coaches advise an individual or team on what levels can be reached and what to do to reach them. 2-88. Like other development processes, coaching has several components: z Building rapport. The coach builds a strong rapport to facilitate trust and open communications. z Gathering and analyzing information. Review performance indicators or leader or team perceptions to determine an accurate picture of capabilities. z Addressing the gaps. Discuss specific issues light of similarities and differences with typical expectations. z Narrowing focus. The coach guides the leader to identify the areas to strengthen and develop. z Setting goals. The coach assists the leader in establishing development goals. z Planning development. Together the coach and leader determine development paths, desired outcomes, and specific developmental actions. z Promoting action. The coach sets conditions that help to sustain developmental action and establish accountability for development. 2-89. Coaches can draw on guided discovery learning techniques to establish and maintain rapport and build commitment. The coach tailors how directive feedback and guidance are depending on the situation and performance level of those being coached. Coaches involved in developmental actions should find a balance between challenge and the learner’s perception of ability to achieve incremental improvement. 2-90. To prepare for coaching, leaders study and apply the fundamental guidelines for leader development. They are passionate learners in the area being coached. They arm themselves with tips, techniques, and practice routines to advise subordinates. Developmental actions for leadership include observing other leaders, modeling what good leaders do, and practicing new techniques or approaches.Leaders can apply techniques in the conduct of their duties, look for different duty opportunities, or identify outside opportunities. Other actions include reading, research, consulting, and formal coursework. Sometimes applying different mindsets and ways of thinking provide enough development to meet established goals. ADP 6-22 provides guidelines for coaching (focus goals, clarify self-awareness, uncover potential, eliminate obstacles, develop action plans and commitment, and conducts follow-up). COUNSELING 2-91. Counseling is the process used by leaders to review with a subordinate their demonstrated performance and potential. See ATP 6-22.1 for more on the process of counseling. Counseling, one of the most important leadership and professional development responsibilities, enables Army leaders to help Soldiers and DA Civilians become more capable, resilient, satisfied, and better prepared for current and future responsibilities. 2-92. Regular developmental counseling is an essential tool for developing future leaders at every level. Developmental counseling is categorized by the purpose of the session. Understanding the purpose and types of counseling enables the leader to adapt the counseling session to the individual subordinate’s needs to achieve desired outcomes and manage expectations. 2-93. Professional growth counseling includes planning for the accomplishment of individual and professional goals. During the counseling, leader and subordinate conduct a review to identify and discuss the subordinate’s strengths and weaknesses and to create an individual development plan using DA Form 7906 (Individual Development Plan) that builds upon those strengths and compensates for (or eliminates) shortcomings. Leaders can assist subordinates in prioritizing development efforts based upon those perceived strengths and weaknesses. 2-94. As part of professional growth counseling, the leader and subordinate may choose to develop a pathway to success with short- and long-term goals and objectives. The discussion includes opportunities for civilian or military schooling, future duty assignments, special programs, available training support resources, reenlistment options, and promotion opportunities and considerations. Documentation of this discussion results in an individual development plan (see figures 3-1–3-4 on pages 3-7–3-10 for examples). Each individual development plan will vary as every person’s needs and interests are different. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-23 MENTORING 2-95. Mentorship is a voluntary developmental relationship that exists between a person of greater experience and a person of lesser experience that is characterized by mutual trust and respect (AR 600-100). A mentor assists personal and professional development by helping a mentee clarify personal, professional, and career goals and develop actions to improve personal attributes, competencies, and skills. A mentee seeks and receives mentorship. Army leaders are encouraged to participate voluntarily in mentoring. 2-96. Age or seniority is not a prerequisite for providing mentoring. A junior individual may mentor a senior individual based on experience or specialized expertise. Having a mentor grows in importance as you become more senior. 2-97. Mentoring is a professional relationship. However, mentor-mentee connections are best when they occur outside the chain of command. This is not contrary to a leader’s responsibility to develop subordinates. It differentiates between the mentor and leader roles to develop, counsel, teach, and instruct subordinates. Supervisors should refrain from appointing mentors or formally matching individuals with mentors. Participant self-selection leads to the most effective mentoring relationship. 2-98. Leaders foster mentorship by— z Educating leaders in the organization on mentor responsibilities. z Participating as a mentor. z Inviting experienced leaders to visit and share their mentoring experiences. MENTOR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2-99. Selection as a mentor is a compliment to one’s professional abilities and competence. Table 2-9 highlights general mentor roles and responsibilities. Table 2-9. Mentor roles and responsibilities Role Responsibility Provides Encouragement and motivation. Candid feedback about perceived strengths and developmental needs. Advice on dealing with obstacles. Guidance on setting goals and periodically reviews progress. Shares Experiences that contributed to personal success. Understanding the Army, its mission, and formal and informal operating processes. Encourages Appropriate training and developmental opportunities. Sense of self-awareness, self-confidence, and adaptability. Efficient and productive performance. Serves As a confidant, counselor, guide, and advisor. As an advisor for career development ideas or opportunities. As a resource for enhancing personal and professional attributes. 2-100. Mentoring is a powerful tool for personal and professional development. Mentoring generally improves individual performance, retention, morale, personal and professional development, and career progression. Mentoring offers many opportunities for mentors and mentees to improve their leadership, interpersonal, and technical skills as well as achieve personal and professional objectives. 2-101. It is not required for leaders to have the same occupational or educational background as those they coach or counsel. In comparison, mentors generally specialize in the same area as those they mentor. Consequently, mentoring relationships tend to be occupation-specific, focused primarily on developing a better-prepared leader. 2-102. Mentoring is crucial to development and retention. Once the relationship is initiated, the mentor has responsibility to— Chapter 2 2-24 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU z Share organizational insight gained through knowledge and experience. Showing mentees how to manage a certain situation is far more effective than just talking them through it. z Expand the mentee’s network. Mentors advise on a spectrum of topics, ranging from specific skills to broader career goals. Mentees gain sound guidance, access to established networks, and enhanced personal and professional perspectives. z Help with setting development goals. Mentees often seek mentors to enable professional growth, perhaps advancement in the organization or in changing career fields. z Provide developmental feedback. Giving feedback increases the mentee’s self-awareness, particularly concerning strengths and developmental needs. MENTORING RELATIONSHIPS 2-103. The appearance of favoritism or creating conflict with raters or senior raters should keep leaders from mentoring subordinates within their chain of command. Subordinates should avoid approaching superiors in their chain of command as mentors. 2-104. A successful mentoring relationship is based on several elements: z Respect. Established when a mentee recognizes desirable attributes, skills, and competencies that the mentor has and when the mentor appreciates the mentee’s attitude, effort, and progress. z Trust. Mentors and mentees should work together to build trust through open communication, forecasting how decisions could affect goals, discussing progress frequently, monitoring changes, and expressing enthusiasm for the relationship. z Realistic expectations and self-perception. A mentor may refine the mentee’s self-perception by discussing social traits, intellectual abilities, talents, and roles. It is important for the mentor to provide honest feedback. A mentor should encourage the mentee to have realistic expectations of their own capabilities, present and potential position opportunities, and the mentor’s offerings. z Time. Set aside specific time to meet; do not change times unless necessary. Meet periodically to control interruptions. Frequently check in with each other via calls or e-mail. 2-105. The mentee must be an active participant in the relationship. Mentees must— z Prepare. Define desired goals for the mentoring relationship. Complete appropriate preparations for meetings with the mentor. z Develop. Work to improve. z Be flexible. Listen to the mentor and consider all new options proposed. z Take initiative. Seek the mentor’s advice when needed. MENTORING BENEFITS 2-106. Soldiers and DA Civilians who seek feedback to focus their development, coupled with dedicated, well-informed mentors, embed the concepts of life-long learning, self-development, and adaptability into the Army’s culture. The benefits are threefold: for the mentor, the mentee, and the organization. Mentor Benefits 2-107. Serving as a mentor provides many benefits, such as— z Professional development. Becoming identified as someone who develops or mentors well-known performers attracts qualified, high-potential individuals looking for opportunities to work for the mentor. Developing others to follow a mentor’s example facilitates the mentor’s own personal and professional development and career progression. z Knowledge. Mentees are a source of general organizational data, feedback, and fresh ideas. Because higher-level positions isolate some executives and managers, mentees serve as an important link in keeping communication lines open. Although mentors possess experience and wisdom, mentees often provide important feedback about views at different Army levels. z Personal satisfaction. Mentors generally report a sense of pride in seeing mentees develop and a sense of contribution to the Army. It is an opportunity to pass on a legacy to the next generation. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-25 z Sharpened skills. Mentors sharpen management, leadership, and interpersonal skills as they challenge and coach the mentee. z Expanded professional contacts. Mentors expand their network by interacting with other mentors, supervisors, and various professional contacts. Mentee Benefits 2-108. Mentees gain tremendously from a mentoring relationship. Such benefits include— z Increasing self-awareness through candid feedback. z Building confidence and encouragement to grow beyond usual expectations. z Having a role model and a trusted advisor. z Gaining better understanding of the Army and what is required to succeed and advance. z Gaining visibility through opportunities to try advanced tasks and demonstrate expanded capabilities. z Reporting greater career satisfaction with higher performance and productivity ratings. Organizational Benefits 2-109. The organization and the Army as a whole benefit in the following ways— z Increased commitment and retention. Mentoring increases the understanding of how to reach the next responsibility level––enhancing duty satisfaction and reducing reasons to leave. z Improved performance. Mentors and mentees have an opportunity to expand their technical, interpersonal, and leadership skills through the mentorship relationship. Mentoring helps mentees identify and prepare for roles which best fit their needs and interests. This enables the Army to fill positions with the most capable, motivated personnel. Mentoring is functionally efficient, because instead of floundering on their own, mentors help mentees to develop career road maps. z Development. Mentoring increases the effectiveness of developmental activities that occur within the unit and generally produces leaders comfortable with senior level responsibilities. z Leadership succession. Mentoring facilitates the smooth transfer of Army Values, culture, traditions, Warrior Ethos, and other key components to the next generation of Army leaders. z Recruitment. An Army-wide mentoring program makes the Army attractive to potential recruits because it shows the Army prioritizes its people and their development. Mentoring Skills 2-110. It is important to possess key mentoring skills to be an effective mentor. These skills include— z Listening actively. Focus on the mentee’s main points and whole meaning. Watch body language, maintain eye contact, and understand which topics are difficult for the mentee to discuss. Showing someone you are listening is a valuable skill. It shows you value what they say, and you will not interrupt them. This requires patience and a willingness to delay judgment. z Holding back judgments. Reduce emotional reactions (such as anger or excitement) to the mentee’s comments. Do not immediately draw conclusions about whether the meaning is good or bad until you are sure you understand the comments. z Asking the right questions. The best mentors ask questions that make the mentee think. However, this is not as easy as it sounds. Simply, think of what you want to tell the mentee and frame a question that will help the mentee come to the same conclusion on their own. To do this, ask open questions that a simple yes or no cannot answer. Alternatively, ask direct questions that offer several answer options. Then ask the mentee why they chose that answer. z Providing feedback. Do this in a way that accurately and objectively summarizes what you have heard but interprets things in a way that adds value for the mentee. Use feedback to show you understand what the mentee's thinking approach has been. This is key to helping the mentee see a situation from another perspective. z Resisting distractions. Control the location and minimize outside distractions as much as possible. Focus on the mentee. Chapter 2 2-26 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU The Value of a Mentor Major General Fox Conner served in the U.S. Army for forty years but is most remembered for his legacy of mentoring a generation of promising officers, notably Dwight D. Eisenhower. While serving under George S. Patton at Fort Meade in 1920, the two forged a close friendship and began preparing for the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth by methodically working through the previous years’ tactical problems the school used. Because of his work with Patton, Eisenhower was a serious student of tactics when Patton introduced Eisenhower to Conner. Eisenhower accompanied Conner to Panama in 1922 as his chief of staff, when Conner assumed command of the 20th Infantry Brigade. Under Conner's tutelage, Eisenhower perfected his administrative and tactical techniques by drafting formal orders for daily brigade operations and analyzing the tactical problems of fighting on Panamanian terrain. Conner directed an intensive reading program that introduced Eisenhower to Plato and Tacitus; influential thinkers such as Nietzsche and Clausewitz; and various contemporary military writers. During Socratic dialogues about the readings, Conner and Eisenhower discussed the nature of war. One important subject often addressed was the difficulty of allied command. Conner insisted the Treaty of Versailles made another war inevitable and any future war would be waged by a coalition with the United States as a member. Because of these dialogues, Eisenhower was aware of the First World War’s allied military command structure defects and pondered the question of coalition warfare as early as 1924. Source: Dwight David Eisenhower: The Centennial (CMH Pub 71-40) STUDY 2-111. Leader development processes in the organization should establish an expectation for each leader to spend personal time seeking knowledge sources and opportunities to grow and learn. If a supervisor’s personal involvement and unit resources were always prerequisites for development, it would be a limited effort indeed. Organization leaders should develop distinct ways to study their chosen profession and identify ways to improve the unit. Encourage subordinates of similar positions or grades to form a community-of-practice group to foster excellence. Provide the groups reachback capability to web-based forums. Provide each group with an opportunity to present recommendations or new methods to the leader team. 2-112. Encouraging professional development through outside study and engagement is a way to broaden knowledge, experience, communication skills, empathy, humility, confidence, and an appreciation for diversity. Leaders can gain a deeper understanding of their operational environment and improve their critical and creative thinking skills. While no limit exists to where leaders may find leadership lessons, mass and social media have generated widely accessible options for all echelons of leaders. Some options are— z Professional reading and writing. z Conferences, panels, and lectures. z Podcasts. z Online discussion forums, blogs, and social media. PROFESSIONAL READING AND WRITING 2-113. Professional reading broadens leader knowledge, understanding, and confidence. Leaders gain a refined understanding of the material and develop critical thinking skills through pertinent discussion with Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-27 others. Discussing ideas and topics with peers, subordinates, and leaders who may offer significantly different perspectives exposes all participants to new ideas and potentially broadens their outlook. 2-114. For personal reading, topics may come from established reading lists, stem from personal interests, or follow from determining strengths and developmental needs. As part of a personal reading program, leaders may choose to maintain a reading journal to take notes and record key passages, insights, and reflections.When recording thoughts, leaders gain clarity, develop new ideas, refine existing ideas, and likely share insights with others. Journals can record related book and article titles for further investigation. 2-115. Documents often suggest related information to expand knowledge of the subject. The end of a chapter or book may list related documents. The bibliography or footnotes identify information sources the author used. To help narrow the search, note any reference that sounds interesting or relevant. 2-116. Individuals should consider writing for publication as a complementary element to a professional reading program. Writing increases self-development as well as develops others who gain from the lessons learned and stimulated thought. Consider publishing papers created through the writing program in branch journals or as blog entries. This shares ideas and gathers feedback for the author, which could be beneficial in further developing the original ideas. CONFERENCES, PANELS, AND LECTURES 2-117. Conferences, panels, and lectures are a great tool for learning about new topics, observing panel member interactions, and seeing how lecturers communicate ideas with an audience. Attending professional conferences and lectures in person can be time and cost prohibitive for individuals and units, but the advent of social media and distributed academic lectures can provide a remote viewing option. The ability for leaders to refine their skills at research, presenting material to an audience, and fielding questions or comments can be an invaluable way to enhance leadership and communication skills. 2-118. Knowing where to find conference schedules or lecture events can help leaders identify events best suited for their learning requirements. Military professional organizations, military history museums and societies, universities and colleges, and professional journals are good sources for lectures, conference panel information, and previously presented content. Following these organizations on social media allows leaders to stay updated about events that may be valuable as learning tools. Along with providing reading recommendations, leaders can provide recommendations for lecture series and panel events that may interest and enhance a subordinate’s development. PODCASTS 2-119. Podcasts cover wide varieties of military and organizational leadership topics and can be used to supplement unit reading or viewing programs. Selecting a podcast for a specific topic equates to helping subordinates choose an appropriate book, journal article, or movie. It requires leader familiarity with the content and the lessons they want a subordinate to learn from the content. Like verifying the credentials for an article or author before including a work in a leader development program, verifying the content and credentials of a podcast host and their participants is equally as important. Multiple DOD and Army podcasts exist to support professional development programs. ONLINE DISCUSSION FORUMS, BLOGS, AND SOCIAL MEDIA 2-120. Online professional discussion forums, leadership-oriented blogs, and social media groups oriented on military leadership provide a wealth of mentorship and development opportunities and potential pitfalls. Online activities and social media are a constant presence in the daily lives of Soldiers, DA Civilians, and Families. Understanding how various platforms work, to include who engages and how they engage, is crucial to Army leaders at all echelons. Soldiers live their lives increasingly online, which influences how they interact with their peers, leaders, and even the American people. This has real-life effects on an organization’s readiness, cohesion, and environment. 2-121. Social discussion forums range from professional discussion forums to informal discussion threads on social media platforms. Using professional discussion boards and blogs for leadership questions and advice can provide new perspectives, creative solutions, and connections between peers and leaders. Informal Chapter 2 2-28 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU discussion forums open discussion to a wider, and often anonymous, audience, providing risk and opportunities for leaders and subordinates. Anonymity allows users to engage in frank discussion on challenging topics that they may feel uncomfortable discussing in person. At the same time, this can create echo chambers and subversive discussion that can harm team cohesion or chain of command. Leaders should understand the potential for positive and negative professional development and dialogue. 2-122. Blogs and video blogs (vlogs) can promote accessible and easily consumable leadership and professional development lessons for a wide audience. Professional military blogs and vlogs promote a faster way for individuals to write, publish, or broadcast on relevant military topics. Like journal articles, leaders should responsibly promote consuming well-researched material. Blogs and vlogs offer multiple topics to highlight leadership concepts and lessons, even those that are not related to the military. 2-123. Army leaders increasingly engage their subordinates, peers, and senior leaders through social media platforms. See FM 3-61 and AR 360-1 for information and guidelines about building and managing unit social media pages. Social media accounts typically fall into two main categories: organization-sponsored social media pages or personal social media pages. 2-124. For leaders developing a plan to maximize their personal social media accounts, building and maintaining a personal social media plan can be invaluable to setting personal goals and limits for engaging others. Selecting the desired platforms requires an understanding of how to maximize the potential for each platform for individual engagement and development. 2-125. For leaders using personal social media to communicate ideas to a wide audience, understanding the fine line between professional and unprofessional behavior is crucial. Using personal social media pages to feature family, viewpoints, and personal achievements and struggles provides an opportunity to highlight the realities of off-duty life. Being transparent and professional are not mutually exclusive for all Army leaders. Social media can offer a wide-reaching option to share the value of professional off-duty Soldiers and leaders. See AR 25-2 and AR 600-20 for information and regulatory guidelines to manage professional behaviors on personal social media pages. SECTION IV–CREATING OPPORTUNITIES 2-126. Creating opportunities for development or using existing experience opportunities is a fourth way to create a development culture. An organizational culture develops based on shared values, beliefs, and learning. These cultural values, when consistent with the mission, affect an organization’s performance. Leaders foster a positive culture by providing a supportive command climate that values member involvement and learning. Likewise, key leader position selections and responsibilities have implications for developing leaders far into the future. Integrating these efforts into a holistic program establishes lasting operating norms. Developing leaders to this level requires investing time and effort but leaves a legacy of trained and ready leaders for tomorrow’s Army. 2-127. Leader selection and screening can be useful in development efforts. Forming leader teams where strengths in one complement developmental needs in another is a common selection goal. Developing leaders is often about preparing them for responsibilities in the next position. Creating opportunities for leader development involves— z Creating challenging experiences. z Sharpening leader selection. z Planning leader succession. z Tracking career development and management. CHALLENGING EXPERIENCES 2-128. Experience is a developmental tool. Pressure, complexity, novelty, and uncertainty characterize challenging experiences. Leaders create learning opportunities by placing subordinates into challenging assignments to stretch their thinking and behavior. Challenge creates interesting and motivating learning situations. Leaders create these experiences or ensure opportunities provide learning experiences. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-29 2-129. All Army assignments inherently provide some developmental challenge. Development happens even if supervisors do nothing at all. Creating the right challenges in a position for a particular leader can dramatically increase development. 2-130. Some missions or circumstances may not offer key developmental opportunities. Supervisors may need to shape position responsibilities to allow a subordinate to enhance personal leadership skills. Before adjusting a position’s requirements, leaders should consider unit and mission demands. 2-131. Leaders should be deliberate in placing subordinates in special missions and organizational assignments. Experienced leaders implicitly know the defining tasks early in an assignment and should be deliberate about identifying these tasks and ensuring each leader gains experience from them. Sometimes, supervisors must assign subordinates to positions where they do not have the requisite skills or experience. Supervisors should consider modifying position requirements and providing additional support or resources. 2-132. Not all leaders develop on the same timelines. Supervising leaders should be willing to adjust how much time each subordinate stays in a developmental position within the parameters available. Supervisors should involve human resources staff early as decisions may have implications beyond the organization. When making such determinations, supervisors should weigh the effects on— z Unit performance. z Leader team stability. z Leadership needs of adjacent units, higher units, and the Army. z The leader’s well-being and personal growth. In determining what subordinates need to learn, ask them about the top three skills they need to improve unit performance. Doing so motivates them and increases their awareness about the leader skills they need to learn. LEADER SELECTION 2-133. Supervising leaders should foster an attitude that leadership positions are not necessarily automatic appointments. It is neither a privilege, nor an entitlement, to serve in a leadership position. A leadership position is an Army requirement to fill a public need to provide for the Nation’s common defense. Therefore, leader selection fills the Army’s requirement with individuals that will best discharge those duties. Selections for key leader positions require thorough consideration. Each step in a deliberate screening and selection process should narrow the field of acceptable candidates: z Forecast potential position openings. z Identify key leader characteristics. z Build a candidate pool by working with higher, adjacent, and subordinate units, as applicable. z Use selection tools to screen out applicants such as— z Conducting a career file review to identify prerequisite experiences and training—review files and rate candidates against career indicators. z Reviewing disciplinary or derogatory information in personnel or intelligence staff files. z Obtaining references or recommendations on the leader from trusted sources. z Conducting structured interviews with candidates for the position—structure the interviews to assess values, attributes, and responses to various situations. z Organizations may develop minimum prerequisite knowledge or skills requirements for specific positions. Final candidates may demonstrate capabilities by conducting a task that proves their qualifications for the position (such as leading a patrol or leading a convoy). z Select and appoint approved candidates. 2-134. If creating a qualified candidate pool is not possible, supervising leaders should consider modifying the position or providing additional support or resources to available candidates. 2-135. Consider the leader team when selecting leaders. For example, pair a technically strong warrant officer with a tactically strong officer. Pair a strong operations officer with an intelligence officer willing to Chapter 2 2-30 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU challenge the operational plan by forcefully presenting the enemy viewpoint. Pair a highly experienced noncommissioned officer (NCO) with a less experienced lieutenant. LEADER SUCCESSION 2-136. Succession planning is a developmental activity for individual leaders that focuses on deliberate planning to provide opportunities for experience in key developmental assignments and to prepare for future assignments beyond the unit. Unit leaders may not have total input into succession planning but with forethought can have plans to rotate leaders within the unit. Succession planning is a local system of talent management. Senior leaders plan systematic subordinate rotation within the organization so that trained and qualified leaders are ready to assume vacancies, proven leaders move on to positions of greater responsibility, and marginal leaders receive opportunities to improve. Succession planning serves individual leaders by looking beyond the organization’s replacement interests. It helps develop leaders with the potential to succeed in future positions beyond their current unit and returns a benefit to the Army by optimizing development opportunities and duration across the unit’s leaders. 2-137. Understanding the projected career paths and timing for leader branches and specialties is an important factor in succession planning. Moving leaders into and out of positions should depend upon— z Unit performance. Keeping leaders in positions long enough so that their stability promotes high unit performance. z Army need. Providing experienced leaders back to the Army to fulfill its requirements. z Individual developmental goals and readiness. Determining when the leader has achieved development goals and is ready to take on new responsibilities and challenges. 2-138. Supervising leaders should work with human resources staff to predict accurate leader gains and losses to the unit. Be sure to— z Account for leader needs for career and position-specific training before position assumption. z Assess leaders during their initial assignments to drive subsequent position assignments. z Use leader vacancies due to schooling, special assignment, or leave as development opportunities; assign less experienced leaders temporarily to the vacancies. Identify the key leader positions that trigger succession planning and management. Chart the timing and sequencing of leaders into and out of unit leader positions. Account for prerequisite schooling and plan primary and alternate candidates for each position. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-31 Grant and McPherson During the American Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant rose to become the Union Army’s Commander in Chief. Along the way, he developed select officers to succeed him. Those supported for further advancement showed three attributes: personal loyalty, a willingness to do any duty necessary to prosecute the war, and a desire to prove oneself in battle. One of Grant’s inner circle gained his full trust and confidence: James B. McPherson. McPherson was a Regular Army officer who graduated from West Point in 1853 and commissioned as an Engineer. Eager to find a combat assignment, he joined Grant’s staff in January 1862 after promotion to lieutenant colonel. McPherson served admirably as Grant’s chief engineer during the Fort Donelson campaign and at Shiloh. A rising star, Grant promoted McPherson to major general in 1862 and appointed him to command an infantry corps. His successes during the Vicksburg campaign cemented his reputation. When Grant was promoted and sent east, he wisely designated McPherson as commander of the Army of the Tennessee. Grant knew the old army adage that “best friends may not always make the best generals.” McPherson had indeed become Grant’s friend over the years. However, McPherson’s ability to see Grant’s goals and work tirelessly to meet them won his commander’s full confidence and support. McPherson did not disappoint. While other generals sought to seize ground and take cities, he endeavored to engage and destroy enemy armies. McPherson’s army was successful in driving the Confederates back through northwest Georgia as part of Sherman’s Atlanta campaign. Leading from the front, McPherson died in action on 22 July 1864. Grant memorialized McPherson as one of the "ablest, purest, and best generals." Sherman called him "a man who was...qualified to heal national strife." Even John Bell Hood, an adversary, marked his passing with friendship and admiration. Yet while he lived, McPherson proved a sterling example of how to establish a succession of command. CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT 2-139. Individuals should understand and actively manage their own career paths while supervisors should consider the career paths and influence their subordinates to gain breadth in development. AR 600-100 directs supervisors to provide opportunities for a subordinate's individual development. Commanders and other senior leaders should encourage their developing subordinates to take challenging assignments. Reserve Component leaders should be aware of subordinates’ civilian development plan as this may affect their ability to take on new and challenging assignments. The ability to see and select the best opportunities for themselves requires leaders to be equally proactive in advocating for subordinates who request selection for assignments and references. This requires leaders to help subordinates account for all their career development factors, including post-military considerations. BALANCING ARMY NEEDS WITH PERSONAL CHOICES 2-140. Finding the proper balance between professional work and personal life while planning career development challenges professionals at all career stages. The Army has experienced significant change with integrating women into traditional ground combat branches and efforts toward inclusion and diversity. This fosters discussion and understanding about family impacts on a Soldier’s career choices and Army impacts on families. Leaders draw on career experiences to help subordinates see how choices affect professional careers and personal lives. Acknowledging the interrelated nature of a professional Soldier’s personal life is a key facet of fostering trust between leaders and subordinates across the force. Most career planning models have common steps— z Perform a self-assessment to determine strengths and developmental needs (based on abilities, characteristics, needs, responsibilities, or interest or goals). z Weigh the possibilities to choose goals and milestones for self-development efforts.Chapter 2 2-32 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU z Generate additional possibilities, goals, and milestones to align self-development goals to determine opportunities or friction points. z Create an IDP that uses effective learning methods. z Implement the plans, overcome obstacles, and measure progress. Ask organizational leaders to describe their most valuable leader development experience. Give them time to think about it before they respond. Have them briefly write about the experience or tell their peer group. Use their experiences to help prioritize implementation. Providing a first, second, third, and fourth priority reflects the understanding that leaders may not be able to implement every idea or method. Some development methods provide a leader with a higher return in performance for less resource investment. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS 2-141. Unit leaders are responsible for creating overall professional development programs, comprised of specific sessions focused on unit needs. Leader professional development programs are deliberate and represent a cohesive approach to increasing the skills and readiness of the organization’s leaders. Leader development programs are an effective vehicle when consistently applied. Successful programs include common elements such as— z Mission-essential leader task training when a common need exists across the organization. z Required orientation or education sessions (such as equal opportunity and safety). z Cohesion-building activities to foster esprit de corps (such as dining-ins, sports, or adventure training). z Opportunities for the commander, command sergeant major, or first sergeant to emphasize key guidance to all leaders. z Education sessions on leader career path topics (assignments, schooling, or promotions). z Education sessions on the mission command principles, culture, and geopolitical issues. 2-142. Professional development sessions, conducted to facilitate discussion and collaboration, are extremely valuable in gaining a greater understanding and applying specific information or skills in a unit. The information sources and means of conducting these sessions are endless and allow for creativity. Instructors should not rely solely on dry briefings. Scenarios and materials should be tailored to the grades and ranks present. These sessions are great team building opportunities to bring together groups of different ranks and responsibilities. 2-143. All these applications fulfill organizational leaders’ training and developmental needs. To implement leader development programs effectively, leaders should follow these guidelines (see Chapter 5 for additional information and examples)— z Link training and professional development. z Clearly communicate purpose and relevance. z Gather all leaders together only when doing so is the most effective learning method. z Consider prior listed applications as integral to leader development programs. Leaders can find materials to support professional development from various sites, such as CAPL. To provide leaders with an in-depth perspective on a mission-essential task for the organization (such as security patrols or convoy operations), supervisory leaders should lead the task in professional development sessions while subordinate leaders perform the Soldier roles. By practicing task execution to standard, the organization’s leaders will be more effective at supervising future execution. Fundamentals of Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 2-33 Example Session: Developing Mission Command Units that understand mission command principles effectively seize opportunities and make decisions consistent with commander’s intent. Consider the following steps to ensure mission command principles are a key part of the training strategy. Step 1: Educate the unit on mission command principles. Members of all ranks need to understand the principles and the need for each. Ask the following questions: - Do leaders integrate mission command principles into training opportunities? If so, how? - Do leaders specifically identify mission command principles when leading subordinates? - Do leaders make subordinates aware that mission command principles exist within their current roles and responsibilities? Step 2: Ask the unit about the roles subordinates play in mission command. Have them describe, in their own words, the concepts of delegated authority and making decisions with commander’s intent. Ask the following questions: - What methods do leaders typically use to delegate authority? - What subordinate actions demonstrate good judgment while exercising initiative? Which do not? - What opportunities do leaders give subordinates to demonstrate achieving the commander’s intent? - To what extent do subordinate responses indicate a clear understanding of the mission command principles? Step 3: Review your leader development program and modify as needed to ensure mission command principles are regularly addressed. Consider how training activities support subordinates in making good decisions when exercising initiative. While completing the review, consider these questions: - What does counseling look like in your unit and how can it be improved? Is it helpful or is it just process? - Does subordinate behavior suggest that commanders trust and support subordinates’ decisions? - Do training events allow subordinates to improve upon their decision-making abilities, in both predictable and unpredictable situations? OPPORTUNITIES DURING TRAINING EVENTS 2-144. Training is an organized, structured, continuous, and progressive process based on sound learning principles designed to increase the capability of individuals, units, and organizations to perform specified tasks or skills. The training objective is to increase competent leaders’ ability to perform in multiple training and operational situations. Individual task training builds individual competence and confidence to perform these tasks to support collective training and operations. 2-145. Leaders contribute substantially to the unit’s mission success or lack of success. Therefore, the Army devotes considerable resources to foster leader development during exercises. Providing leadership feedback is a challenging, yet essential, part of training exercises. Leaders have a specific task to observe subordinates during planning and while executing missions. Understanding how to treat leadership as a skillset to develop and improve is an essential contributor to mission accomplishment. 2-146. Where possible, leaders ought to use guided discovery learning. This places the observed leader in charge of their learning, with the chain of command in a supporting role. Using guided discovery learning during training exercises prepares the leader to be a self-guided learner in any setting. See Section II in chapter 2 for leader performance descriptions at different proficiency levels to support observation and feedback efforts. Chapter 2 2-34 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Missed Opportunities CPT Williams’ company was tasked to run the battalion M2 range. Knowing the company’s high operating tempo while preparing to deploy for an NTC rotation, she assigned the duty to her top performer, LT Taylor. She got several updates from LT Taylor regarding planning and resources for the range; she led battalion range operations before and understands LTC Cano’s expectations. CPT Williams is therefore surprised when LTC Cano stops by. LTC Cano: “CPT Williams, I understand everyone is busy, but I feel you may have missed an opportunity to offer LT Taylor some much needed guidance concerning the M2 range. While he had a very solid plan, there was some key information missing in his brief to me that I feel you would have caught. Did he provide a backbrief to you on his plan of action before presenting it to me and MAJ Blank?” CPT Williams: “I did not require him to backbrief me, sir. I instructed LT Taylor to run the plan and his resource requirements by 1SG Diaz while I was focused on other tasks. I did not take the time to bring him in for a rehearsal brief. Guess I hung LT Williams out to dry.” LTC Cano: “The mistakes were minor, and the plan was sound, however it is our duty to prioritize development of our leaders, to show them, for example, how much rigor should go into planning, and how overlooked details can result in serious consequences.” CPT Williams: “Yes, sir. In this case, the fact that LT Taylor has participated in but never run an M2 range before, I should have prioritized supervision of the 8-step training model.” CIVILIAN TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS 2-147. The Civilian Education System is a structured program with central funding for all DA Civilians and serves as the foundation for civilian leader development. DA Civilians have developmental opportunities based on their duty series, grouped into career programs. Each career program provides career-planning tools to enable core competency development. The Army Career Development Program provides a planned course of professional development by combining formal training and education with progressively challenging work experiences. See AR 690-950 for more information. 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 3-1 Chapter 3 Self-development 3-1. The gravity of the Army mission and the world’s dynamic nature make continual learning and self- development crucial to personal success and national security. Rapid changes in geopolitical affairs, technology, and general knowledge require individuals to stay current. Army and civilian schools provide basic knowledge and techniques individuals need to review and update after they leave school. To thrive professionally and personally, individuals must engage in life-long learning and self-development. 3-2. Self-development bridges gaps between the operational and institutional domains and sets conditions for continual learning and growth. Soldiers and DA Civilians engage in self-development to improve their capabilities for current and future positions. Self-knowledge is an important part of a leader’s development. The Army provides tools to facilitate leaders’ understanding of strengths and developmental needs throughout a military career (see Websites within References). Institutional and operational training assignments cannot meet all learning needs. Self-development is essential to attain and sustain the competencies needed to perform successfully. Self-development activities reinforce and expand the depth and breadth of what leaders learn in classrooms and on duty. Self-development activities enable achieving personal and professional development goals. 3-3. Self-development obtains the best results when it is planned, competency-based, and goal-oriented. However, an important aspect of self-development is distinct from the other training domains: you are responsible for directing personal self-development activities—not your supervisor or the Army. 3-4. Although engaging in self-development is a personal responsibility, leaders are responsible for creating an environment in which self-development is a priority. Leaders need to be actively involved in developing themselves and each other. Self-development begins with feedback. Development happens through study and practice. Leaders can support others’ self-development through the exchange of professional development information, discoveries, and opinions. As owners of their career and self-development, leaders are ultimately responsible for managing it. For example, you are the only one who can: z Assess your current career status, knowledge and skills, personal interests, and accomplishments. z Do you have the technical and tactical expertise you need? z Do you have the leadership skills you need? z Honestly determine your willingness to invest the time, effort, and mobility needed to advance. z Seek information about duty options, development paths, and training opportunities. z Set your career goals, develop a plan, establish a timetable, and monitor your progress. 3-5. Self-development supports planned, goal-oriented learning to reinforce and expand the depth and breadth of what a person knows to include themselves and situations they experience and how they perform their duties. The Army acknowledges three self-development types: z Structured self-development includes mandatory learning modules required to meet specific learning objectives and requirements. z Guided self-development is optional recommended learning to enhance professional competence. z Personal self-development is self-initiated learning to meet personal objectives such as pursuing a college education or an advanced degree. 3-6. The self-development process has four major phases— z Strengths and developmental needs determination. z Goal setting. z Self-enhanced learning. z Learning in action. Chapter 3 3-2 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU STRENGTHS AND DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS DETERMINATION 3-7. The first step in determining strengths and developmental needs is to think about what you do and how well you do it. At a minimum, this information comes from self-examination. Examining personal strengths and developmental needs is a skill improved over time. Feedback can come from formal or informal assessments and from other leaders, peers, or subordinates. Outside opinions and information on strengths and developmental needs are useful, however, admitting and accepting discovered developmental needs requires a leader to be open to accepting feedback and self-aware, which streamlines the self-development process. Keep this in mind during a self-examination. 3-8. Understanding current strengths and developmental needs is necessary before setting self-development goals. This requires leaders to be self-aware about their leadership behaviors. These methods help identify strengths and developmental needs: z Formal assessments. z Feedback gathering. z Situation and self-analysis. z Strengths and developmental needs identification. FORMAL ASSESSMENTS 3-9. Formal assessments, such as evaluations and tests, are a good place to start gaining insight into strengths and developmental needs, since they measure individual performance and compare it to a standard. Individuals use the information and results from relevant assessments to develop their full potential by understanding personal strengths and developmental needs. Formal assessments also allow the Army to understand the effectiveness of its leader development programs and improve processes through refinement. 3-10. Assessments can take many forms and provide insight on a diverse range of factors, including academic grades from Army courses, practical exercise results, self-reflection on duty performance, developmental counseling, official performance appraisals, multisource assessments, tests, or dispositional inventories. Some of the more common assessments used by the Army are— z Multisource assessments allow subordinates, peers, and superiors to anonymously assess the leader using a standard set of items. z Army developmental assessments, such as the Leader 180, Leader 360, or Commander 360, provide 360-degree assessments of leaders measuring the Army leadership competencies. The Army uses the Unit 360 to compile individual-level multisource assessments to give unit leaders a holistic understanding of their unit’s leadership capabilities. z Army administrative or talent management assessments, such as the Army Commander Evaluation Tool, Army Leader Assessment Tool, or the Enlisted Leader Assessment Tool. z Intelligence and aptitude tests, such as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or Defense Language Aptitude Battery. z Personality or dispositional inventories, such as the Social Skills Inventory, Social Awareness and Influence Assessment, Self-Awareness Individual Differences Inventory, or Individual Adaptability Measure. z Interviews. z Simulations or exercises assessed by trained observers or behavioral scientists. z Performance evaluations. z Counseling sessions (formal and informal). z Skills tests (such as the Expert Field Medical Badge, Expert Soldier Badge, or Expert Infantryman Badge tests). z Tests administered in resident and non-resident schools. z Standardized assessments proctored during resident schools. z Field performance evaluations such as those at the combat training centers. z Occupational interest inventories. Self-development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 3-3 3-11. Individuals differ in their abilities and assessing their knowledge, skills, attitudes, traits, or potential can be useful for development and talent management. Depending on the purpose, assessments have different conditions for administration, use, validation requirements, and access to results (see AR 600-100). Developmental leader assessments provide individual feedback to enhance performance for current positions or to develop personnel to assume future positions of greater authority and responsibility. Results from developmental assessments are confidential and owned by the individual leader. Talent management assessments support decisions about selection, promotion, placement, or assignment. When used appropriately, valid assessments can increase the accuracy of personnel decisions. The Army owns the results of these assessments, and the individual may or may not have access to the results. Assessments used for talent management purposes must satisfy higher legal and professional standards with respect to validity (construct, content, and criterion), fairness, and reliability than developmental assessments. 3-12. Assessments are not a solution, but rather the first step in the long process of development. Assessments provide individuals and units insight to help drive growth, better leverage strengths, and address gaps or weaknesses. Assessments are useless without developmental action. 3-13. Reviewing formal assessments without experience can be problematic. Understanding how to combine multiple formal perspectives on performance to get a complete picture may challenge junior leaders. Reading and interpreting evaluations and testing results is a learned skill. Performance evaluations provide a narrow view of a person’s overall leadership performance and potential, focusing on specific events pertinent to the rating period. The language can also be misleading, avoiding subtle developmental needs in favor of condensed feedback for an external audience (such as promotion, selection, and retention boards).Performance evaluations, aptitude tests, and counseling sessions can provide skewed inputs if not taken in context of a larger set of feedback results. Piecing together a performance pattern requires aligning evaluations and tests from multiple sources, accounting for situational context to see patterns, and making assumptions about strengths and developmental needs. Accepting and acting on feedback from assessments also requires a growth mindset to continually develop and reinforces the Army’s readiness. FEEDBACK GATHERING 3-14. Hearing what peers, subordinates, superiors, mentors, family, and friends think can help identify unnoticed or reluctantly acknowledged strengths and developmental needs. Leaders get feedback by observing how they interact with others or asking directly. Supervisors have an explicit role in subordinate development. Subordinates should consult supervisors for guidance about development goals or any other self-development aspect. Observe Others Observing how others act toward you and the decisions they make affecting you give an idea of what they think about your skills and expertise. Observing the same person on different occasions helps you see trends that may signal a firmly held opinion. One observation is not reliable, as that behavior may have been a result of other issues. Consider the circumstances. What outside factors influenced their decisions and actions? For example, if your supervisor selected someone else to perform an important task, was it because you were too busy or unavailable? 3-15. After considering these questions, analyze the answers to determine the opinions that each person considered may have of your strengths and developmental needs: z Supervisors, raters, and superiors. z Who gets the most challenging assignments? z Whom does the supervisor rely upon during emergencies or tough problems? z Whom does the supervisor praise the most? z What tasks does your supervisor assign to you versus others? z How does your supervisor react to your suggestions compared to others’ suggestions? Chapter 3 3-4 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU z Does your supervisor listen to your opinions on certain subjects much more or much less than others’ opinions? If so, what are those subjects? z Peers and subordinates. z Do peers and subordinates come to you for help or advice? On what topics? z Do they understand you or seem confused or overwhelmed by what you say? z Do they repeatedly ask for help or are they one-time interactions? z Does their interest and enthusiasm increase or diminish when they interact with you? z What does their body language communicate? Is it relaxed, apprehensive, or reserved? Asking for Feedback 3-16. One learns a lot about others’ perceptions through observation, but conclusions are only educated guesses unless you ask others directly. To gain perspective, talk to others who know you in different ways, such as rater, enlisted or officer counterpart, mentor, instructor, or family member. The goal is to find out— z What they saw and their impressions of your action(s). z That person’s impression of how well you performed during the interaction(s). z How you react in certain situations. For example, “When a subordinate challenges your authority in front of others, you seem to get flustered and be at a loss for words.” Who to Ask 3-17. These are items to consider when determining who to ask for feedback— z Who has been able to observe you enough to offer useful information? z Who has observed you from different perspectives? z Who has experience in an interest area (former or current supervisor, mentor, or teacher)? Things to Remember When Asking for Feedback 3-18. When asking for feedback, keep the following in mind— z Respect others’ time—prepare questions in advance. z Approach with an open mind to accept uncomfortable or critical feedback without offense. z Listen carefully and respectfully. z Ask for clarification and examples when points are unclear. z Summarize the points to ensure you understand them correctly. Request permission to read points back to the feedback providers for confirmation. z Thank the feedback providers for their time and assistance. 3-19. These ideas may help you focus on what to ask: z Get descriptions and opinions of your behaviors. z For feedback about a recurring issue, ask about the situation, your actions, and the usual outcomes. z Ask for suggestions for other ways to handle situations. 3-20. Look for common themes by comparing the received feedback to identify strengths and developmental needs. Army leaders must avoid the natural inclination to reject or minimize responses that do not confirm self-perceptions or attribute them to a situation instead. SITUATION AND SELF-ANALYSIS 3-21. After gathering information from assessments, observations, and feedback, reflect on personal behavior and performance. Examining personal situations and experiences can reveal areas to change or improve. The situation analysis exercise helps analyze experiences to identify personal strengths and developmental needs. Determining what feedback is crucial to self-development can be challenging for junior leaders who may receive more feedback than they can realistically process for analysis and development. A trusted mentor or leader can assist learning how to assess and develop. Self-development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 3-5 Situation Analysis for Self-development Use these questions to reflect and analyze experiences for insight into personal strengths and developmental needs. - What was the situation? What happened? Who was there? - What were you trying to accomplish? - What needed resources or skills did you have or not have? - What did you say or think? Were you able to express your point? - What made you feel good (confident, excited) or bad (confused, worried)? - What did you do? How did you act (including body language)? Why did you make those choices? Did you help or hurt the situation? - How did others react? Did you adjust your actions based on others’ reactions? - Why did you act that way? What knowledge and skills led you to act that way? - What could have helped you handle the situation better? Could you have used your strengths for a better outcome? - Do you need to prioritize any developmental needs? 3-22. After recording the information, look for key factors that influenced the situation and overall outcome. If the same factor occurs in multiple situations, it may suggest a significant strength or developmental need to develop. By knowing how personal actions, and the associated thoughts and feelings, affected the situation, leaders can become more self-aware and choose the most productive actions. Additionally, a self-analysis may suggest broader interests to pursue or issues to avoid. Complete a Self-Analysis Consider these prompts while being as specific as possible to identify unique personal strengths and developmental needs. Strengths The skill or ability at which I am best is— The personal quality that I rely on most for my success is— I am most knowledgeable about— The activities I look forward to include— I would love to learn more about— I am most proud of this accomplishment— Developmental needs The skill or ability that is always difficult for me is— The knowledge or skill I require to be a better leader is— I do not know as much as I should about— I usually go to others for help on— The situation that causes me the most frustration is— I am most hesitant when I try to— I am most concerned about my— Competencies required for my current or future role are— STRENGTHS AND DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS IDENTIFICATION 3-23. The final step is to analyze the information gathered from formal assessments, information gathered from observing others, asking others, and situation and self-analysis results to determine strengths and developmental needs. 3-24. Weight feedback based on its frequency, look for recurring feedback themes or patterns heard from more than one person. Look at what others identified as strengths and developmental needs and compare that to personal knowledge (from the self-exam) and formal assessment results. Chapter 3 3-6 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU 3-25. Usually, repeated success or expertise in a particular activity indicates a strength. These abilities may come easily even though others find them difficult: z What are favorite things to do or learn about? z What do others turn to you for help with? z What do recent assignments show as strengths? 3-26. Developmental needs are often tasks that are a struggle to learn or difficult to perform: z What was hard or not fun to do? z What knowledge, skills, and behaviors are required from a position description? z Did formal assessments indicate any deficiencies? 3-27. Identify where these descriptions apply and develop strengths and developmental needs lists. These lists enable setting clear goals for self-development efforts and can be documented on an IDP. GOAL SETTING 3-28. To maximize self-development efforts and avoid wasting time and energy, it is crucial to set self- development goals—identify personal and professional capabilities to improve and decide what to do. Creating an IDP documents and allows tracking of these goals. This section outlines procedures to— z Create and maintain an IDP. z Identify self-development opportunities. z Plan milestones to keep on track. INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS 3-29. IDPs span across the institutional, operational, and self-development leader development domains and apply throughout a career. They provide a framework to identify and document a person’s holistic strengths and developmental needs to guide self-development. In addition to strengths and needs, leaders are encouraged to consider their physical fitness goals; their cognitive abilities to include critical thinking skills, communication skills, and technical and tactical knowledge; and their leadership skills with a focus on their self-awareness and ability to employ the competencies. 3-30. Once a leader has gathered feedback, completed a self-analysis, and identified personal strengths and developmental weaknesses, they are ready to document goals and a plan to address those goals using an IDP. IDPs take leaders from where they are to where they want to be by incorporating short- and long-term goals along with action plans to address those goals. All individuals are responsible for developing and maintaining their IDP as goals will change over time. 3-31. Figures 3-1 through 3-4 (see pages 3-7 through 3-10) provide completed example IDPs. These IDPs for military and civilian members address short- and long-term goals, strengths, needs, and career planning. Self-development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 3-7 Figure 3-1.

Understanding strengths and developmental needs determines where to focus self-development efforts. In addition to leadership assessments feedback, roles and responsibilities (personal and work-related), and Army needs can provide self-development opportunities. Roles and Responsibilities 3-33. Work and nonwork roles have different responsibilities, skill and knowledge requirements, and expectations. Reserve Component leaders have a unique opportunity to improve both civilian and military skills by linking self-development goals to skills shared by both professions. 3-34. Chosen roles usually reflect personal interests and values, but even assigned roles affect the value of different self-development paths. When roles and responsibilities align with talents and interests, leaders are likely to succeed and be satisfied. Analyze Roles and Responsibilities List three to four important work and nonwork roles. Next to each role, list the two most important responsibilities in that role. Identify knowledge, skills, or behaviors that enable better performance of these roles and responsibilities. Army Needs 3-35. Another way to identify satisfying goals for self-development efforts is to align personal interests with Army needs. Soldiers and Army units must be ready to deploy and accomplish diverse missions. Some requirements may be unforeseen and untrained, requiring Soldiers to use their knowledge, skills, and creativity to accomplish missions. As members develop expertise, the unit and the Army become stronger. The expertise range and depth provide unit resiliency and an increased ability to adapt to specific challenges. General Stilwell’s Commitment to Self-Development Early in his career, General Joseph Stilwell found he had a gift for languages and sought opportunities to develop this ability. Before World War I, he traveled extensively on leave through Latin America and Asia, perfecting his Spanish and learning Japanese and Chinese. His unique proficiency earned him an assignment as the U.S.
Army’s first language officer in China in 1919. In 1921, he volunteered to oversee an International Red Cross rural road-building project to interact directly with Chinese officials and laborers to hone his language skills. After a year, Stilwell was conversant in a notoriously difficult language and familiar with a culture alien to most Westerners. Stilwell spent most of the next 20 years becoming one of the U.S. Government’s most trusted China experts. In 1926, he commanded a U.S. Army battalion near Beijing; in 1935, he became the American military attaché in China. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall appointed Stilwell commander of the China- Burma-India Theater and chief of staff to Chiang Kai-Shek, the leader of Chinese forces fighting the Japanese. Between 1942 and 1944, Stillwell deftly used his knowledge of Chinese language and culture to build rapport with Chiang Kai-Shek, ensuring Chinese Nationalist forces remained a partner against the Japanese. MILESTONE PLANNING 3-36. After establishing self-development goals, create milestones to get started and gauge progress. Use an IDP to document goals and milestones. Milestones can mix short-term and long-term—whatever personally works and encourages progress. Milestones should— Chapter 3 3-12 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU z Be specific and measurable: They state what to accomplish so you know if the milestone is met. z Be meaningful and relevant: They should help achieve self-development goals. z Provide a challenge: Milestones should stretch personal abilities and be challenging to accomplish. Challenging milestones increase motivation; being too easy or hard can hurt motivation. z Have a time limit: Time limits provide motivation and gauge success. z Be flexible: Build in some flexibility to overcome obstacles or revise milestones if necessary. z Be realistic: Ensure milestones are reachable with available resources. For example, if a deployment occurs in the next 12 months, do not set a milestone requiring college attendance during that time. Keep in mind that unforeseen obstacles may occur along the way. z Be cost effective: The benefits gained must be worth the effort, resources, risk, and other costs to reach the milestone. 3-37. Every milestone requires at least minimal planning. After setting the first milestone, create a plan to achieve it. A plan increases success by— z Identifying all required actions. z Identifying the resources needed to meet the milestones. z Establishing time estimates and deadlines that help track progress. z Dividing large tasks into smaller parts to reduce being overwhelmed. z Identifying possible obstacles and the actions and resources needed to overcome them. z Maximizing personal time and other resources. Plan to Meet Milestones Develop a plan by listing the first milestone. Identify the main steps needed to reach it along with associated timelines. Consider all the developmental resources the Army has to offer as well as other sources to reach each milestone. Identify potential enablers and obstacles before beginning to better prepare for difficulties along the way. Collaborating through online forums and interest groups may help personal development and provide encouragement. SELF-ENHANCED LEARNING 3-38. Self-development requires learning. Knowing how to learn is the most important skill required for self- development. Self-understanding, setting self-development goals, and planning milestones all influence a personal ability to learn. Effective learning requires— z Motivation and persistence. z Learning opportunities.z Effective learning methods. z Deep processing. z Learning through focused reading and analysis. MOTIVATION AND PERSISTENCE 3-39. Self-development may require hard work over a long period, especially if the goal is to become an expert in an area or undergo significant personal growth. It takes motivation and effort to keep self- development efforts alive. Genuine motivation provides lasting energy because it internalizes the goals and the desire to achieve them. Table 3-1 (on page 3-13) provides tips to stay motivated to make significant change. Self-development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 3-13 Table 3-1. Tips for motivation To... Think about/do... Recognize benefits of self-development efforts Why the results are personally important. How you feel after reaching these self-development milestones. The positive effect these efforts have on others. Plan learning activities Connect to practical application. Teach knowledge, skills, or abilities that help personal understanding. Satisfy curiosity. Set specific and challenging milestones Know personal limits. Provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction after achieving them. Acknowledge milestone accomplishment and adapt when necessary. Maintain momentum Make it routine. Work on the task a little every day until it is accomplished. Break a big task into smaller ones to accomplish in a reasonable time. Do not be afraid to restart a learning task that has paused for an extended time. Get support Find family members, friends, or supervisors for encouragement, accountability, recognizing accomplishments, and feedback. Observe others who successfully achieve their goals. Is their method appropriate to your goal? Review what has been learned so far Think about personal growth and resolved challenges. Learn from mistakes. Do not repeat them. LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES 3-40. Learning stems from deliberate planned activities or unplanned experiences. Maximize each learning opportunity, whether planned or not. Leaders embed planned learning into routine duties with typical events or a separate, scheduled activity as learning opportunities. Take advantage of unexpected opportunities such as cancellations or transportation delays by having appropriate learning materials available. 3-41. Unplanned learning happens when something unexpectedly captures your attention. Attune your mind to draw attention to information related to self-development aims by thinking about developmental aims in detail—what you are trying to accomplish and why you want to accomplish them. Review what you know and what you need to learn. Review key ideas related to the subject as well as who the experts are. Personal AAR Personal AARs are in-depth assessments of how your leadership contributes to task and unit performance. Leaders should conduct personal AARs by asking themselves: - What happened and what were the consequences? - How were my leader actions supposed to influence the situation? - What were the direct results or consequences of my leader actions? - How did my actions benefit or hinder mission accomplishment? - How should I change my leader actions for better results next time? - What did I learn? Unit AARs clarify what happened and accurately assess mission accomplishment. Encourage personal AARs following the unit AAR process by: - Walking less experienced leaders through a personal AAR. - Asking individuals what they learned from their personal AARs. - Sharing personal AAR outcomes with subordinates. EFFECTIVE LEARNING METHODS 3-42. The purpose of each learning activity determines the learning principles to use to maximize learning. No matter the purpose, general learning principles apply: Chapter 3 3-14 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU z Employ all your senses. Memory stores information according to the senses (how it looks, sounds, feels, tastes, or smells). More senses used while learning enable better memory and information recall. Involve multiple senses by taking notes, highlighting, reciting, and observing. z Space out learning sessions. Do not try to learn a large amount of information or a complex skill in one long session—break the material into several manageable sections. z Study the information or practice the skill on multiple occasions. z Know the time you learn best and study the most difficult material during that time. z Design learning activities so that they mimic reality as much as possible. If the expected conditions to use the information cannot be duplicated, imagine the conditions as vividly as possible. z Familiarize information through self-study before formal instruction. Reinforce learning by reviewing the information after instruction. Review exercises memory skills. z When learning an entirely new field, go slow at first to ensure thorough understanding of the basics—it is important to have a solid foundation to build on. z Learn in layers. Start with what you know to determine the first level of understanding, information, or skill needed. Learn that level then determine what the information just learned suggests learning next. Each level builds on the previous and usually becomes increasingly detailed and interconnected. z Learn like a scientist. Scientists adopt the attitude that the best knowledge is subject to change and that new discoveries may prove old beliefs or assumptions wrong. Start the inquiry with a problem or question. Find evidence that answers the question and test possible explanations to gather evidence. It is important to discover information that questions or refutes the possible explanations to avoid confirmation bias. Analyze the evidence and develop an explanation. 3-43. While the general learning principles apply to all learning types, some learning principles apply based on whether the learning activity focuses on learning a new skill, a new behavior, or new knowledge. 3-44. Learning or improving a skill requires repeated, deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is not just skill repetition. Deliberate practice involves— z Making your best attempt at performing the skill. z Analyzing the attempt results (sometimes with coach or instructor help) to identify ways to improve personal performance. z Attempting the skill again using the identified improvements. 3-45. Learning a new behavior about something requires repeated exposure to and testing of the behavior. Taking on a new behavior might involve realizing that a prior viewpoint is counterproductive to obtaining goals. Changing behavior is done one of two ways: z Behave as if you have already adopted the new behavior. If done often with positive results, it is likely that you will adopt the behavior. z Observe another person behaving in a way that reflects the behavior. If you respect this person as a role model and see them gaining some benefit from the behavior, you may eventually come to personally accept and adopt the behavior. 3-46. Learning new knowledge requires linking the new information to already known information. This occurs by deeply processing the information you want to learn. The following section details deep processing and the related critical and reflective thinking skills. DEEP PROCESSING 3-47. The ability to learn and recall information depends upon what someone does with the information while learning it. Deep processing requires analyzing the new information, picking it apart, using it, and connecting it to already-known information. Many ways exist to practice deep processing: z Relate the new information to something already known. z Accept that there may be a difference between new and previously known information. z Summarize the material you are learning in your words or diagram it visually. z Organize new information into categories. Self-development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 3-15 z Ask and answer questions to make new facts, ideas, and principles useful and important: z How does this relate to prior knowledge? z What does this imply? z What other examples do I remember? z Why is this important to me (or others)? z Where else could this apply? z Where or how could this be used? z Develop comparisons. What does the new information remind you of? z Explain or teach the material someone else to test your understanding and mastery. z Check multiple sources to gain complete, objective information. Argue both sides of an issue for understanding to avoid an echo chamber. 3-48. Using critical, creative, and reflective thinking skills are essential to being an effective learner and gaining subject expertise. These skills are essential practices to deeply processing information. Several thinking types facilitate Army leader development and skills— z Critical thinking. z Creative thinking. z Reflective thinking. z Strategic thinking. Critical Thinking 3-49. Critical thinking skills facilitate learning assessment and problem solving. Critical thinking questions what you see, hear, read, or experience. Critical thinking ensures the person is engaged in the learning process, critically considering the information or skills practice. Critical thinking requires analysis, comparisons, contrasting ideas, making inferences and predictions, evaluating the strength of evidence, and drawing conclusions. It requires the self-discipline to use reason and avoid impulsive conclusions. Developing critical thinking skills requires practice. (See ATP 5-0.1 for information on critical thinking processes.) These questions guide critical thinking— z Who or what is the idea source? z What is the evidence for and against this conclusion? z What are alternative or competing theories, explanations, or perspectives? z Why is this important? z What are the implications? z Is the argument logic or reasoning sound? z Do the numbers, quantities, and calculations make sense? z Do the supporting facts agree with other sources? z Why or how does this work? z How likely is this? Creative Thinking 3-50. Creative thinking involves examining problems from a fresh perspective to develop innovative solutions. Creative thinking occurs by consciously generating new ideas and re-evaluating or combining old ideas to solve a problem. Creativity is a willingness to accept change and apply a flexible outlook for multiple perspectives, new ideas, and possibilities. 3-51. Identifying hidden assumptions is useful for developing greater creativity and insight. Producing reasons against a preferred conclusion or option instead of favoring that conclusion or option improves thorough reasoning and identifies possible contingencies. Imagine what causes a speculative conclusion to be incorrect. Considering ways something would not be true allows determining other possible situational aspects and ways to shape the outcome to avoid those undesired states. Chapter 3 3-16 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Finding hidden assumptions or imagining failure are similar techniques that protect against group think and hasty agreement with conventional wisdom. Think about what could cause failure. Those causes are likely assumptions that were not evident. Identifying hidden assumptions can mitigate the risk of an incorrect assessment. Reflective Thinking 3-52. Closely related to critical thinking, reflective thinking seeks to build understanding, interpret experiences, and resolve questions. Reflective thinking requires thinking through the gathered information in detail to organize it, apply principles, make connections, and form conclusions. Table 3-2 provides example questions to help leaders reflect on their thinking and develop better judgment. Table 3-2. Reflective question examples For organizing personal thoughts ask: What does this information mean? What conclusions can be drawn from this? How is this information used? How does this fit with my existing knowledge and experiences? What are the implications for others or me? What is the big picture and how does this fit into it? What is the best way to learn about this subject? Where should this take me in my studies and self-development? For improved understanding ask: What is this situation? What other situation is like this one? What is this situation not like? What do I know about situations like this? How could this situation happen? How should I think about this situation to define the problem or opportunity? What is the real problem? What do I not know that I should? For improved visualization ask: What else could this situation or solution be? Are any assumptions unneeded; are new ones needed? What constraints are there? What needs to be accomplished? What is likely to happen? How should I prepare for future situations? For improved decision- making ask: What is the solution or plan? Does one solution dominate others? Can the solution be redesigned so that it does? Is there a specific way to reason and decide about the solution? What would my enemy not want me to do? Critical, Creative, and Reflective Thinking Development 3-53. Critical and creative thinking come together as practical thinking that captures the strengths of how people approach everyday problems. Critical thinking brings out differences that are not normally obvious. Creative thinking techniques help generate new insights. Both thinking types fill in knowledge gaps and resolve uncertainty. Practical thinking signs include a willingness to try alternate approaches to thinking, being open to others’ positions, being prepared to think about issues instead of ignoring or dismissing them and asking insightful questions. 3-54. Leaders must develop critical and creative thinking in team members. The ability and capacity for intellectual and critical thought are essential to effective problem solving. Subordinates’ actions, based on Self-development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 3-17 their critical thinking skills, often dictate team success. An excellent way to develop critical thinking in an organization is through example, by being a critical thinker. Thinking critically and setting conditions that encourage others to think critically effectively enhance the process. 3-55. How people think and feel about learning affects their thinking and judgment development. For example, an attitude that thinking can resolve problems leads to better results in overcoming difficulties through thinking. Attitudes that conflict with sound thinking should be diminished, such as changing one’s mind is a sign of weakness, being open and deliberating among options leads to confusion, quick decision- making is how one demonstrates expertise, or truth comes from authority. 3-56. Positive attitudes that contribute to developing critical and creative thinking include— z Persistence. If one line of thought or action is not working, then finding another line may work. z Willingness to expend effort. A willingness to engage in deeper, more thorough thinking is important for critical thinking, even when the effort may not initially seem useful. z Active fair-mindedness. Making special effort to find out whether one’s ideas will work by imagining what is wrong with them is a good way to be fair-minded. Using the same standards, regardless of the issue or who supports a position is another fair-mindedness quality. z Ego detachment. Keeping reasoning separate from self-esteem helps guard against being caught up in being on the right side of an argument or rationalizing why failure was out of one’s control. z Uncertainty tolerance. Believing it is fine not to know something is a positive characteristic. Yet, motivation to resolve uncertainty, once recognized, is even more important. Thinking through problems, instead of using minimal cues to interpret a situation incorrectly, is an advantage. z Openness. Being open to different and multiple possibilities leads to better decisions. z Commitment retraction. Willing to change beliefs about a preferred solution or a problem viewpoint is an attitude that has positive effects. z Process flexibility. Realize that standard processes will not work for novel, ill-defined, or complex problems. Adapting or discovering a new way to think may help reach a solution. z Willingness to learn. It is natural for leaders to feel an expectation to have the knowledge and experience to perform well. Being willing to engage in learning is adaptive. One expert characteristic is that they understand what they know and what they need to learn. 3-57. Thinking ahead and predicting potential ways that a situation assessment may be wrong or that a course of action could depart from the anticipated plan prepares leaders to handle the unknown. Having identified and worked through various contingencies better prepares the team for what could occur. Strategic Thinking 3-58. Strategic thinking is an imperative for military leaders to shape the future of operations and to steward available resources. Strategic thinking is valuable at all leadership levels. It is important to consider the overall situation and make decisions that set the stage for plans lasting years. Strategic thinking generates a cohesive understanding of situational dynamics presenting advantageous options and long-term organizational success. Thinking skills and activities directed at outcomes that produce an overarching approach or plan to achieve a particular aim characterize strategic thinking. In this case strategic describes the thinking type rather than the doctrinal usage to describe a level of war, security objectives, or ideas to employ the instruments of national power. In contrast to thinking following traditional problem-solving steps, strategic thinking is not looking to solve a bounded problem but is creating a decision set or pattern to achieve future success. While a tactic specifically prescribes how something is done, a strategy is a philosophy of what is valued and consists of guidelines or boundaries to shape what actions to take. 3-59. Clearly, strategic thinking is an important skill for senior leaders to establish high-level goals and broadly scoped policies. However, strategic thinking is important for junior-level leaders when they address recurring problems and consider enduring, robust solutions. The earlier leaders are exposed to strategic thinking, the more likely they will try it, apply it, and, over time, improve. 3-60. Strategic thinking can be broken down into several activities: z Situational understanding. Scanning for recurring, novel, and key cues integrated and used in sensemaking, predicting, and testing what exists enable understanding.Visualization is a related Chapter 3 3-18 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU activity to fill in knowledge gaps about existing or future considerations. Subskills include discriminating among relevant cues, integrating diverse information, applying mental war- gaming, and modeling. z Questioning. Asking questions demonstrates an openness to different perspectives and a desire to consider alternate or unconventional assessments. Questioning, a key component of thinking critically, improves the thoroughness of judgment. Consistently demonstrating a willingness to shift perspective, search for alternate explanations, and avoid mindsets and fixations characterize cognitive flexibility. z Systems thinking. Systems thinking involves considering the factors of a situation or a solution as an interrelated system with inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback. A systems orientation operates from a view that an understanding or model can be created to explain or improve what occurs (as applies to situational understanding) or what could occur (as applies to problem solving). See Army Design Methodology doctrine for more about systems thinking. z Analogical reasoning. Thinking that deals with complex problems with unfamiliar or unknown conditions and outcomes occurs by drawing on current knowledge. Analogical reasoning is a specific approach where known or similar concepts and relationships map to what is yet not understood. Historical comparisons are useful in strategic thinking to consider what has occurred under one known condition set. z Self-awareness. Since strategic thinking involves unknowns, multiple paths, trials of what might exist in a situation, and possible solution results, an ability to manage personal thought processes is important. Metacognition is being aware of what oneself is thinking, what one knows, progress toward a conclusion, and testing strategic approaches and conclusions about them. 3-61. Developing strategic thinking occurs by addressing complex, dynamic challenges while practicing critical and creative thinking, working in context, and gaining basic skills in situational understanding and visualization. Leaders or instructors can accelerate subordinates’ thinking development by assigning projects or duties with opportunities for strategic thinking. Professional military education courses reinforce strategic thinking by assigning projects requiring skills application and grading how well a student employs them. Ambiguous or Unfamiliar Situations 3-62. Deliberate effort applied to thinking is a way to provide best guesses about ambiguity—uncertain situations, uncertain actions by an adversary, and uncertain outcomes. One way to prepare is to have a standard question set to ask when faced with uncertainty. Developing a practice of asking questions prompts additional reasoning. Table 3-3 provides some example questions to focus thinking. Table 3-3. Example questions to focus thinking Question prompt Example What if…? What if…this assessment was not the case? What else…? What else…is happening? So what? So, what if that happened…is there a meaningful difference? What are the specifics? Can claims be confirmed with specific information? Is there a weak link? Are there any inconsistencies or confusions? What is unexpected? Are there new conclusions or implications? 3-63. It is natural to discount information when it does not fit expectations. Some refer to this as confirmation bias, but that reference implies a conscious or active process when it usually is not. It is difficult to undo someone’s assessment or conclusion once it forms. The first step to protect against discounting unexpected signals is to pay attention to information that does not fit expectations. Assessing the information can indicate whether an understanding needs to change. If no definite determination is possible, even heightened vigilance for change should occur. 3-64. The dominance structuring technique is a useful way to problem solve to ensure the best available solution is considered and chosen. Leaders can use the dominance structuring technique in a formal military decision-making process. It is a way of thinking to iterate through course of action development, analysis, comparison, and wargaming. The technique adapts to time available and known details. Self-development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 3-19 Dominance Structuring Technique First, consider the relevant problem dimensions. Look for the solution that dominates all other possible solutions on the most important dimensions. Identify the initial most promising alternative solution by eliminating alternative solutions that are unattractive on important dimensions. Choose an alternative if it is better than all others on at least one dimension and equal to other options on other dimensions. This will be the dominant solution. If the most promising alternative does not initially dominate all other alternatives, then reconsider advantages and disadvantages. If necessary and when possible, modify the most promising alternative until it dominates other alternatives. This will be the dominant solution. If no dominant solution appears, reconsider the most important problem dimensions to repeat the dominance comparisons among alternatives. LEARNING THROUGH FOCUSED CONTENT ANALYSIS 3-65. Books, journal articles, lecture series, podcasts, documentaries, movies, professional panel discussions may be key learning resources for self-development. To maximize learning, approach consuming content for learning differently than casual content consumption. Deep processing is essential to the ability to understand, recall, and use the learned information. Even though a book or professional lecture may present information in a logical way, the learner must take an active role to understand the information. 3-66. The Survey-Question-Read-Recite-Review method uses deep processing principles to focus content analysis. Developed over 70 years ago, these activities comprise a most widely recommended and effective way to learn from written materials. This same method can also extend to other materials, such as analyzing a professional lecture series or documentary. 3-67. Survey. Scan the chapter, article, lecture notes, video comments, or other material to build a mental material framework or outline and establish a purpose for consuming it. This mental framework will help understanding the material’s purpose, set expectations to draw attention to important information, activate memory of what is already known, and develop a skeleton of understanding. Survey the material by— z Predicting discussion topics. Complete accuracy is not necessary, but it helps active understanding of the material. z Noting the title, topic sequence, and their relationships. z Looking at graphs, charts, diagrams, and pictures and read their captions. z Reading and verifying quotations, vignettes, and other short statements. z Scanning footnotes, references used, and presenter history and credentials to sense where ideas come from or what they mean. z Noting emphasized words and phrases. z Reading the introduction, abstract, and summary if available. z Reviewing other aids that the material may have, such as study guides, advance organizers, chapter outlines, learning objectives, or review questions. z Deciding what to learn from the material. 3-68. Question. While surveying the material, list questions you want to answer while consuming the material. Developing questions to guide your study increases interest in the material, alerts you to important information, helps you stay involved with the material, and relates the new knowledge to what you already know. To develop questions— z Turn the title or headings into questions. For example, if a heading is “The Four-Step Calibration Process,” a question may be, “What are the four calibration process steps?” z Ask questions about graphs, charts, diagrams, and pictures. For example, a graph showing an increasing rate of traffic fatalities in the United States could lead to the question, “Why have traffic fatalities increased in the United States?” Chapter 3 3-20 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU z Consider questions that the author or presenter includes such as in call-out boxes or review questions. Rephrase these questions so that they are meaningful and easier to remember. 3-69. Read (View or Listen). Consume the material one section at a time. Engage several senses by reading, listening, watching, or taking notes. These tips aid understanding, retain interest, and retain information: z Look for the answers to your questions and write them in your words. z Look for additional questions to answer and important information that you had not anticipated. z Use deep processing to relate the new information to things you already know. z Note important information, especially information that answers questions you wrote. z Make diagrams that show how a process works, timelines, event sequences, or the relationships that exist between different components. z Respond to points by noting ideas in the margins, a separate notebook, or device. This personalizes the information and relates it to information already known. For example, notes may highlight disagreements, how a stated idea relates to another idea learned elsewhere, gaps or questions that remain in the information, or information implications. z Look for connections, discrepancies, comparisons, and relationships between information presented in the document and other readings, lectures, or personal experiences. 3-70. Recite. Reciting tests knowledge and information understanding. Self-testing is a method of deep processing to enhance memory. Reciting helps minimize knowledge gaps. z Stop reading or listening at the end of each section and summarize the material from memory. z Ask the questions you previously wrote for that section. z Explain charts, graphs, diagrams without referring to personal notes. z Review the section until you can recite its important information and concepts. 3-71. Review. Reviewing helps refresh and strengthen memory and material mastery. z Review the material immediately. Review again in 24 hours and again several days later. z Review your written questions and see if you can answer them. Study the material to answer any missed questions. z Explain how all the sections fit together. What are the overarching points and principles? z Explain how the information in this document relates to self-development goals. z Interaction with a friend or coworker who has studied the same information can help maintain focus, provide different perspectives on the material, and clarify difficult or misunderstood points. REFLECTIVE JOURNALING 3-72. Journaling may track and record the occurrence, actions, and outcomes of various situations. Reflective journaling goes beyond a personal AAR to include periodic entries on self-awareness of personal strengths, developmental needs, values, feelings and perceptions, and questions and ideas about leadership situations. A leader may track personal successes and lessons learned by dedicating time to recording their experiences in leading others, chosen actions, resulting outcomes, and any insights. The journal may serve as a reference to pass along lessons learned to others. Key leader references may be recorded. 3-73. Sample reflective journaling questions include: z What is the best thing that happened today or this week? z What is my most difficult or satisfying work? Why? z What do I think is my most valuable or valued contribution? z What compliments and criticisms have I received lately? What did I learn from them? z What did I learn due to a recent disappointment or failure? z How do recent experiences connect to my long-term goals? z What risks have I taken (or avoided taking) lately? 3-74. Individual leaders should decide whether to share their journal content with their immediate leader or others. Leaders can reinforce reflective journaling by— Self-development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 3-21 z Carrying a journal and being seen writing. z Citing lessons learned while referring to journal entries. z Providing time for a leader to reflect and write down personal lessons learned. z Providing leaders with a journal and a personal note encouraging them to use it. z Asking leaders to write or recount a story of a key leader challenge and use the stories to pass on lessons learned to less experienced leaders. 3-75. Cooperative methods of online journaling, sharing online blogs, or cooperating in message boards can help source novel ideas and solutions from a community of like-minded individuals that a leader might not normally interact with on a daily basis. Sharing ideas, questions, and solutions in an online forum, social media platform, message board, or professional blog enables a wider audience to interact and share thoughts, offering an external viewpoint or insight. The same reflective journaling questions still apply, but this enables a much more visible and accessible presence to reinforce the importance of reflective journaling. LEARNING IN ACTION 3-76. Self-development takes time and effort. Putting a plan into action requires patience and resilience. Anticipating and accepting setbacks as part of the process requires commitment. Acknowledging and accepting that self-development efforts must balance against organization requirements and family obligations is crucial. Having the support of peers, leaders, subordinates, family, and friends throughout a career-long self-development effort can provide motivation through lulls in achieving milestones and goals. To stay on track— z Let milestones serve as a guide. z Overcome self-development obstacles. z Work efficiently. z Maintain forward momentum. z Assess progress. z Make course corrections. z Set the next milestone. LET MILESTONES GUIDE 3-77. Use the milestones technique previously discussed and developed in this chapter as a guide to— z Avoid impulsive actions that may be ineffective and discouraging. z Keep the big picture in mind. z Work effectively toward self-development goals. z Take advantage of resources and overcome obstacles. z Measure success. 3-78. Adjust the plan as needed to reach milestones. Be willing to update the plan to improve it, change goals, address obstacles, take advantage of resources, and reflect upon accomplishments. OVERCOME SELF-DEVELOPMENT OBSTACLES 3-79. In developing a milestone plan, you identified obstacles to reaching the first milestone. The possibility of encountering internal and external obstacles, despite thorough preparation, is always present. Internal Obstacles 3-80. Procrastination, apathy, and pride are major obstacles to self-development and occur for many reasons. Some come to realize their milestones are too ambitious, complex, unclear, or difficult. Others hesitate because of the effort or discomfort the work requires or lack the motivation to start. It is easy in such situations to allow other work priorities to distract developmental efforts. Table 3-4 on page 3-22 provides techniques to address procrastination. Chapter 3 3-22 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Table 3-4. Techniques to address procrastination Get started now Write it down Post goals and milestones where you see them frequently. List the benefits of doing the work. Write down the next planned action and associated deadlines. Involve others Tell others about personal intentions and deadlines. Talk through the task with someone else. Schedule time with someone to study or work together. Break it down List the steps required to accomplish each milestone. Break big tasks into smaller, manageable tasks. Mentally rehearse a difficult task or talk through the task with someone else. Establish a routine Pick a routine time to work on self-development activities. Use good time management skills by following a dedicated schedule. Plunge into the task immediately to gain momentum, keep it going. Know yourself Know your habits. Recognize what you do to avoid things you do not want to do. Confront yourself when you do these things. Identify self-defeating attitudes and replace them with positive ones. If you repeatedly delay a task, do you really intend to do it? If not, remove it from the plan. Be open to deviations If an area is overly complex or uninteresting, consider an adjustment for a higher potential path. 3-81. Poor attitudes interfere with learning and impede understanding and remembering information. For example, thinking math is hard or disliking history can interfere with learning anything related to math or history. Other attitudes, such as closed mindedness, inflexibility, or rigid adherence to beliefs and assumptions, can interfere with learning. To combat poor attitudes, identify a productive replacement. Practice thinking and behaving with a positive attitude until it feels natural and becomes a habit. 3-82. A lack of knowledge may be a major obstacle in reaching milestones. Being unaware of the resources, processes, and best practices of others who have worked toward similar goals may hinder progress. Involving others may provide the necessary information and motivation to making progress. External Obstacles 3-83. External factors such as workload or other personal or professional obligations may affect self- development efforts. Seeking support from family and friends enables their involvement and awareness of your milestones and goals and allows them to provide help and support. 3-84. Lacking resources is another common roadblock. Resources include anything needed for self- development including people (such as teachers, coaches, or mentors), facilities (such as schools, libraries, or museums), and things (such as training programs, books, and equipment). Learners best handle external obstacles through careful planning and creativity. WORK EFFICIENTLY 3-85. By efficiently managing workload and personal life, one can increase how much time is available to spend on self-development.To increase efficiency— z Take care of yourself. Proper food, exercise, and rest enable you to function at your best. z Manage time and energy efficiently. Keep a running ‘to do’ list. Prioritize each task according to its importance, required work, and completion date. Remove low-priority tasks from the list. z Look for ways to accomplish daily activities and routines in less time. For example, combine several errands in a single trip instead of making individual trips. z Learn to quickly locate and obtain the information needed for self-development and other daily life requirements. Self-development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 3-23 z Organize work and living areas so that required information, tools, and workspace are available. MAINTAIN FORWARD MOMENTUM 3-86. It is important to keep the developmental momentum moving forward. There may be a tendency to slow down after completing an important self-development step or be discouraged by setbacks. Resting after a strong effort is natural, but too much rest may make it hard to restart. Maintain momentum by— z Keeping a positive attitude: Let setbacks go and start each day with renewed enthusiasm. Each morning offers an opportunity for a fresh start. z Making consistent progress: Accomplish something, however small, related to self-development milestones and goals each day. z Recognizing benefits: Benefits are tangible results such as increased pay, awards, and abilities or intangible results such as pride, a sense of accomplishment, and satisfaction. Remember that important benefits often require hard work. ASSESS PROGRESS 3-87. Assessing progress can provide encouragement to keep going if things are going well or to guide changes if they are not. Individuals can assess progress at any time—while working toward a milestone or after completing one. To assess progress— z Use objective and subjective measures. z Objective measures can be seen or expressed in numbers, such as test scores, time required to perform tasks, number of books read, or college credits earned. z Subjective measures cannot be easily observed or expressed in numbers, including feelings of satisfaction, accomplishment, personal growth, or difficulty. Subjective progress assessments can come from personal judgment and feedback. Subjective indicators are often sufficient to track most self-development activities. z Compare the milestone plan with what happened and adjust the remainder of this milestone plan or future milestones to account for lessons learned. z Timeline: Was the timeline met? If well under or over the timeline, determine why. Maybe the timeline was not reasonable, more or less work was anticipated, received extra help, encountered obstacles, or the material was more involved than initially thought. z Action Steps: How successful were you in accomplishing the steps identified for reaching the milestone? What helped or hurt success? Were the identified steps the right ones? z Resources: Were required resources to achieve the milestone correctly identified? Did the plan omit any resources? Were necessary resources available? Are there any other resources that might have worked better? z Obstacles: Were identified obstacles encountered? Was the plan to overcome these obstacles successful? Were unexpected obstacles encountered? z Decide if you are satisfied with your progress or if the milestones or self-development goals need changes. Indicators to consider in making a course correction include: z Unsatisfactory progress. z Too much stress or effort required to complete developmental activities. z Loss of interest in achieving self-development aims or change in the benefits expected from achieving those aims. z Changes in professional or personal situations that conflict with self-development activities. z Being dissatisfied with personal development. MAKE COURSE CORRECTIONS 3-88. Self-development occurs over time in a dynamic environment that includes professional and personal responsibilities. At some point, obstacles or other challenges force a change of plans. If the progress assessment indicates course corrections are needed, determine what correction is warranted: Chapter 3 3-24 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU z Goal: A self-development goal or milestone may have been too difficult, too easy, or just not what was hoped. Examine other possible self-development goals or milestones. Identify why you selected the unsatisfactory goal or milestone. Avoid repeating any missteps. z Action Steps: If the actions taken to achieve milestones were ineffective, figure out why and develop effective actions. To be effective, you must be capable and willing to perform the actions with available resources. If a course correction is required due to obstacles, then create new action steps that avoid or solve these obstacles. Action steps should form a logical path from where you currently are to achieve the milestone. z Resources: The identified milestone resources may have been inappropriate, inadequate, or unavailable. If so, analyze planned action steps to determine the resources (such as time, money, equipment, facilities, or help) needed to perform these steps. Determine if they can be obtained. SET THE NEXT MILESTONE 3-89. With the first self-development milestone achieved, a full self-development cycle is completed. It is now time to continue the self-development process by setting and pursuing the next milestone. 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 4-1 Chapter 4 Learning and Developmental Activities 4-1. This chapter provides a deliberate and logical framework to support Army leaders developing themselves and others. These activities follow the same organization as the leader attributes and competencies found in the Army leadership requirements model (see ADP 6-22), to help individuals identify and prioritize which leader requirements to target for growth. The developmental activity tables follow a standard format: strength and need indicators, underlying causes, and recommended options to initiate action. The indicators provide ways to understand leader actions and confirm aspects of each leader behavior as a strength or a developmental need. The underlying causes provide more information on what the root cause may be for a developmental need. The tables provide three options for developmental action: feedback, study, and practice 4-2. To best use this chapter’s information, one identifies the competency and attribute behaviors for developmental focus. An individual may already have an IDP that documents goals and a plan for development or have an idea of what leadership competency or skill to develop. A coach, rater, counselor, or mentor can use this material to help focus leaders or subordinates on specific developmental goals and prepare for growth counseling. Different sources and events inform the process to identify developmental goals for competencies and behaviors as illustrated in table 4-1. Table 4-1. Developmental goal identification Source or event providing developmental goal identification Example Interest of the developing leader Thinking to self: “I read about the importance of teamwork and cohesion. I want to get better at setting a positive climate that encourages subordinates to promote development in their Soldiers.” Multi-source assessment and feedback report or coaching session Leader’s assessment interpretation: “My feedback report shows that across subordinates and peers my communication skills are the lowest rated relative to all other areas.” Performance evaluation and developmental growth counseling session Rater’s feedback: “You are good at motivating your Soldiers, you could grow into an even better leader by learning to better integrate tasks, resources, and priorities to select how best to direct Soldiers to achieve results.” Mentor’s advice Mentor’s observation: “To move to the next level you could learn additional ways to operate with others outside the Army and to extend influence.” Self-realization during institutional education course Thinking to self: “My fellow students generally seem more knowledgeable than me about world affairs affecting our Army.” Counterpart feedback received during a training center rotation or home station training Observer/controller comment: “Under stress you are overly directive; you could learn to use commitment-building actions to expand your influence toolkit.” Tip: When considering learning and developmental activities, some automatically think about taking a formal training course or reading. While these may be helpful, leaders are encouraged to select developmental activities that fit with personal preferences and situation. It is important to think through personal and career goals when deciding on a developmental activity. Chapter 4 4-2 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU CAPABILITY EVALUATION AND GROWTH 4-3. After identifying a developmental focus, refer to the Army leadership requirements model and the leader developmental tables to evaluate the leader capabilities associated with the selected competency or attribute. Each section is designed to help a leader act on strengths as well as developmental needs. Some may experience greater growth by focusing on improving strengths rather than focusing on developmental needs or using strengths to address developmental needs. CAPABILITY EVALUATION—STRENGTH AND NEED INDICATORS AND UNDERLYING CAUSES 4-4. Evaluating capabilities involves identifying personal practices that support or hinder successful performance. Each table includes diagnostics to enable evaluating how well someone is doing on that behavior and provides examples of why they may or may not be excelling. Consider if the strength and need indicators represent personal behaviors. Be aware of counterproductive leadership behaviors. Many leaders are aware of such behaviors but choose to overlook or condone them to achieve short-term results, but oftentimes some leaders may not even realize they display such behaviors. Each diagnostic section includes: z Strength Indicators: Behaviors and actions that contribute to or support successful performance. z Need Indicators: Behaviors and actions that reduce or hinder successful performance. z Underlying Causes: Examples why someone may not excel at a particular leader behavior. CAPABILITY GROWTH—FEEDBACK, STUDY, AND PRACTICE 4-5. To help individuals build an improvement strategy, the developmental activity tables provide options to initiate capability growth. Table 4-2 outlines methods to engage in three developmental activities: z Feedback. Sources and methods for obtaining feedback to guide self-development efforts. z Study. Topics and activities to learn more about a behavior. z Practice. Actions to improve skill and comfort in performing a leader behavior. Table 4-2. Methods to implement developmental activities Developmental Activity Options to take Method Feedback Ask for feedback… From others about specific issues and performance areas. Gain support… From peers, colleagues, or others who can encourage or recognize success. Consult… With friends, supervisors, peers, subordinates, coaches, mentors, or other professionals to give advice on strengths or areas of concern. Study Observe… Other leaders, professionals, and similar organizations. Note the most or least effective behaviors, attributes, and attitudes. Reflect on… Personal or situational characteristics that relate to the strength or need. Consider alternative perspectives. Read/Listen to… Books, articles, manuals, podcasts, and professional publications. Investigate… A topic through internet or library searches, gathering or asking questions, and soliciting information and materials. Practice Practice… A skill or behavior during work or away from the unit. Participate in training… Including Army schools, unit training programs, outside seminars, degree programs, and professional certifications. Teach… A skill you are learning to someone else. Accept an opportunity… To stretch personal abilities, such as presenting, teaching, volunteering for assignments, position cross-training, or representing the unit at meetings. Explore off- duty events… Such as leading community groups, trying a new skill in a volunteer organization, or presenting to schools and civic organizations. Learning and Developmental Activities 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 4-3 DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITIES 4-6. Within the leadership requirements model, competencies are skills that leaders can train and develop while attributes encompass enduring personal characteristics molded through experience over time. Applying the if-then logic in table 4-3 to each developmental goal helps maximize development efforts. For greater understanding to direct development, first seek feedback and follow with study and practice. If a developmental need is known but how to address that need is unknown, start with study and follow with practice. If the only unknown is what to practice, then focus on the practice activities. Table 4-3. Evaluation model If… Then… I need more insight into how well I demonstrate a competency or component and what I can do to improve... I should seek Feedback. Feedback is an opportunity to gain information about how well you are doing. Feedback can include direct responses, personal observations, analysis of response patterns, and acknowledging outcomes. I need to gain or expand my understanding of theory, principles, or knowledge of a leader competency or component... I should Study. Study facilitates an intellectual understanding of the topic. Study can include attending training courses, reading, watching movies, observing others on duty, and analyzing various information sources. I need more experience to build or enhance my capability through opportunities to perform a leader competency or component... I should Practice. Practice provides activities to convert personal learning into action. Practice includes engaging in physical exercises, team activities, rehearsals, and drills. 4-7. View all suggestions for developmental activities through a personal lens. The following questions are sample questions to ask when refining a development activity to fit personal needs and situation. Depending on the chosen activity, other considerations may be important too. Be willing to take risks and choose activities outside personal comfort zones to challenge yourself and accelerate development. Determining Developmental Activities Answer these to select appropriate developmental activities: Developmental Activity: How do I need to improve? Desired Outcome: What do I hope to achieve? Method: How am I going to do this? What resources do I need? Time available: When will I do this? How will I monitor progress (such as identifying and monitoring milestones, rewarding success, or identifying accountability partners)? Limits: What factors will affect or hinder successfully implementing this activity? Controls: What minimizes or controls the factors that hinder implementing this activity? 4-8. Use tables 4-4 and 4-5 (starting on page 4-4) to locate appropriate developmental activities. Leader 180 and Leader 360 feedback reports detail individual or unit strengths and developmental needs. Learners and coaches select a few actions at a time to guide development. Additionally, these reports inform leaders of any counterproductive leadership behaviors others have observed in them. 4-9.

Chapter 4 4-6 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Employing Leadership Requirements Model Developmental Activities CPT Kenny and 1SG Mac are briefing LTC Day on an upcoming team live fire exercise. At the end, LTC Day asks what competencies or attributes from the leadership requirements model they are targeting with the training event. Neither could answer the question. LTC Day: “Gentlemen, your plan is sound, and the outcome will be trained teams ready to move into greater collective training, but we are missing an opportunity to develop our leaders here. Training without thought of the LRM is like an unguided missile, it gets the job done, but we owe it to our subordinate leaders to be precise. Don’t let leader development just happen, be deliberate and actively plan for it.” CPT Kenny and 1SG Mac return to their office to discuss what LTC Day said. CPT Kenny: “I understand what LTC Day said, and I know our leaders need some work. We have both worked with them on their IDPs. Several things almost derailed our individual training leading up to this, mostly centered on communication. What should we do to focus on that?” 1SG Mac: “We wanted to get better tactically, but maybe we should have been more specific. We know what we want to improve, we just didn’t select competencies to work on. Perhaps we can alter our training scenarios to deliberately target communication between leaders.” After NTC, the OC/T, CPT Smole, is conducting the final AAR with the company. CPT Smole: “Let me begin by saying that it was truly a pleasure to watch this company operate during this rotation. You clearly put emphasis on communication during training because everyone was on the same common operating picture from the command team to the lowest private and it showed in how well you adjusted to changes in the plan.…” ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I never would have thought that I could design training that would deliberately develop attributes or competencies without LTC Day asking the right questions. Nor would I have thought that it would work. Once we figured it out though, we incorporated it into everything we did and every leader could always tell me what the training objective, and developmental objective, for every event was. I had no greater pleasure as a company commander than deliberately developing my subordinates and watching them progress into great leaders in their own right. ~from the diary of CPT Kenny (former company commander) ARMY VALUES 4-10. Soldiers and DA Civilians enter the Army with personal values developed in childhood and nurtured over years of personal experience. By taking an oath to serve the Nation and the Army, one agrees to live and act by the Army Values. Adherence and dedication to the Army Values reflect character. The Army Values consist of the principles, standards, and qualities considered essential for successful Army leaders. To develop character in others, leaders must embody the Army Values. The Army Values are fundamental to Soldiers and DA Civilians making the right decision in any situation. Teaching values is an important leader responsibility that creates a common understanding of the Army Values and expected standards. Leaders must communicate expectations that others embody the Army Values as well. Reinforcing ethical standards increases the likelihood of ethical decisions and actions and promotes an ethical climate. 4-11. Three components compose the attribute Army Values: z Essential principles, standards, and qualities for successful leaders. z Discern right from wrong in any situation. z Develop Army Values in all Army individuals. Learning and Developmental Activities 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 4-7 ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES, STANDARDS, AND QUALITIES FOR SUCCESSFUL LEADERS 4-12. Successful soldiering requires Army leaders to demonstrate strict adherence to strong principles of ethics and duty. Leaders who possess the desired qualities articulated in Army doctrine and adhere to Army standards will be successful (see table 4-6). Table 4-6. Essential principles, standards, and qualities for successful leaders Strength Indicators Need Indicators Demonstrates a strong sense of duty. Treats others as they should be treated. Demonstrates courage and perseverance when faced with adversity. Seems to demonstrate cowardice through failure to address issues directly. Fails to keep commitments to others. Exhibits unreliability in adverse conditions. Underlying Causes Does not see how their duties as a Soldier contribute to the good of the Nation. Puts personal needs ahead of the mission and duties as a Soldier. Has not internalized the Army Values. Chooses to overlook or is not aware of counterproductive leadership. Feedback Reflect on situations in which a role model demonstrated or could have demonstrated a strong sense of duty. Consider what you would do if you were in that situation. Reflect on your expressions of courage and perseverance (Do you always put the mission, what is good for the Army, and your unit ahead of personal interests?). Study Access the Central Army Registry to complete L20 IMI−The Value of Self-Awareness to determine how self-aware you are of personal traits, feelings, behaviors. Review the counterproductive leadership modules on the CAPL website to identify, assess, and address counterproductive behaviors.

The Army recognizes seven values that comprise the Army Values. All Army members must develop and internalize the Army Values (see table 4-8). Table 4-8. Develop the Army Values in all Army individuals Strength Indicators Need Indicators Demonstrates the Army values in all facets of their life. Demonstrates a strong sense of commitment. Demonstrates strong identity as a Soldier. Engages in helping others. Fails to consider being a Soldier as part of what defines them. Questions their command’s motives. Demonstrates a self-serving attitude. Underlying Causes Did not successfully indoctrinate during initial entry training. Has an unwarranted sense of entitlement. Lacks understanding of the importance of service to the Nation. Overly selfish. Seeks to accomplish personal goals and needs before those of others or the unit. Feedback Think about deeply held beliefs and personal values. What motivates you more: making an impact or recognition for the impact and status that accompanies the recognition? Be open to other feedback sources about how values motivate you. Study Review the Army Values training found on the CAPL website and consider your answers to the facilitator questions.

Practice Incorporate Army Values into everyday duty decisions and life. Legend: CAPL Center for the Army Profession and Leadership IMI interactive media instruction EMPATHY 4-15. Empathy is defined as the ability to share and understand someone else’s feelings. The capacity for empathy is an important attribute for leaders to possess. Empathy can allow leaders to understand how their actions affect others. The ability to see something from another person’s viewpoint, to identify with, and enter into another person’s feelings and emotions, enables the Army leader to better interact with others. 4-16. Army leaders show empathy when they genuinely relate to another person’s situation, motives, and feelings. Empathy does not necessarily mean sympathy, but identification leading to a deeper understanding. Empathy allows the leader to anticipate what others are experiencing and envision how decisions or actions affect others. 4-17. Leaders with a capacity for empathy can apply it to understanding and anticipating the reactions of DA Civilians, Soldiers and their Families, and local populations. Empathy helps a leader take care of Soldiers and others and demonstrate respect. Army leaders take care of Soldiers and DA Civilians by giving them the training, equipment and support needed to accomplish the mission. They value balance between mission requirements and the welfare of their followers. It improves morale, climate, decision-making, and readiness. The attribute empathy has one component: Identify with another person’s feelings and emotions. 4-18. Army leaders must be able to understand different personal value systems and that these values directly influence how others feel about various circumstances, situations, and decisions. Being able to put oneself in another’s situation to identify with their feelings is important to develop a full understanding of others to make better decisions and adapt interactions with others (see table 4-9 on page 4-9). Learning and Developmental Activities 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 4-9 Table 4-9. Identify with another person’s feelings and emotions Strength Indicators Need Indicators Reads others’ emotional cues. Predicts how others react to certain events. Interprets others’ non-verbal behavior (body language). Shows compassion when others are distressed. Recognizes frustration and others’ need for assistance. Demonstrates ability to establish good rapport. Considers alternative others’ viewpoints and feelings when making decisions. Displays an inability to take another’s perspective. Lacks concern for others’ emotional distress. Does not appreciate how cultural differences affect perception. Fails to consider the effect of actions on others. Does not adapt communication style to audience. Does not recognize when others need assistance. Maintains an egocentric viewpoint in decision- making process. Dehumanizes enemy combatants or local populace. Underlying Causes Lacks empathy; does not appreciate the importance of empathy. Overly self-centered. Lacks cultural competence. Engages infrequently in face-to-face communication with others. Often values mission accomplishment over welfare of individuals. Does not recognize value in others’ perspectives. Feedback Ask others you trust how they think you understand their situations or a given problem. Review command climate survey results to see what members think. Do they feel psychologically safe and protected? Reflect on what you contribute to their positive and negative ratings. Review any available leadership assessments and reflect on your ability to understand others. Is it due to similar or different ratings by yourself and others? Study Read relevant literature on empathy and social perspective taking. Study non-verbal indicators of a person’s emotional state. Discuss assumptions and assessments with others.

Imagine what their assumptions and preferences would be. Do this when interacting with a peer or a group. Actively combat moral disengagement (rationalizing that ethical standards do not apply) demonstrated by others: directly address instances when they fail to show concern for others. Legend: IMI interactive media instruction WARRIOR ETHOS/SERVICE ETHOS 4-19. The Warrior Ethos refers to the professional attitudes and beliefs that characterize the American Soldier. It reflects a Soldier’s selfless commitment to the Nation, mission, unit, and fellow Soldiers. DA Civilians, while not warfighters, embody the Warrior Ethos principles through a service ethos that integrates their conduct of duty with the same attitudes, beliefs, and commitment. The Warrior Ethos is developed and sustained through discipline, commitment to the Army Values, and pride in the Army’s heritage. When lived by Soldiers and supported by DA Civilians, the Warrior Ethos is the foundation for the winning spirit that permeates the institution (see table 4-10 on page 4-10). 4-20. Embedded in the Soldier’s Creed, the Warrior Ethos forms the foundation for the American Soldier’s spirit and total commitment to victory, in peace and war, always exemplifying the ethical behavior and Army Values. Four elements compose the Warrior Ethos, where Soldiers— Chapter 4 4-10 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU z Put the mission first. z Never quit. z Refuse to accept defeat. z Never leave a fellow American behind. Table 4-10. Exemplifies the Warrior Ethos/Service Ethos Strength Indicators Need Indicators Consistently does what is right, professionally and ethically. Possesses mental toughness. Pride themselves on being a member of the Army. Provides Isolated Soldier Guidance to all. Makes ethically questionable decisions. Avoids adversity. Does not take pride in being a member of the Army. Underlying Causes Lacks self-discipline, confidence, composure, mental agility, or resilience. Does not align personal values with Army Values. Has a sense of entitlement. Overly self-centered. Improperly trained and non-proficient in warrior tasks and drills. Feedback Check yourself: do you understand the Warrior Ethos/Service Ethos? In what situations will they be most difficult to follow and why? Study Read Medal of Honor citations. Reflect on what the individuals did that exhibit this attribute component. How can you apply what you have learned in your life? Observe someone you feel exhibits this behavior well. Emulate those behaviors. Read relevant literature on military traditions and historic examples. Understand the Code of Conduct (Executive Order 10631) standards while in combat or in captivity. Access the Central Army Registry to complete L27 IMI−Fostering Team Unity. Practice Find opportunities to highlight the importance and relevance of the Warrior Ethos. Share your story about commitment to your units and the Army. Legend: IMI interactive media instruction DISCIPLINE 4-21. Discipline is a mindset for a unit or an organization to practice sustained, systematic actions to reach and promote a capability to perform its military function. Often this involves attending to organization and administration details, which are less urgent than an organization's key tasks, but necessary for efficiency and long-term effectiveness. Making the right choices involves discipline. Discipline is a reinforcing function to character. Self-discipline is everyone’s responsibility, while leaders also are responsible for unit discipline. Development relies on self-discipline to put others’ needs ahead of personal comfort and desires. The attribute discipline has a single component: Control personal behavior. 4-22. Discipline at the individual level is primarily self-discipline, the ability to control personal behavior. Discipline expresses what the Army Values require—willingly doing what is right (see table 4-11 on page 4-11). Learning and Developmental Activities 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 4-11 Table 4-11.

Demonstrates punctuality and reliability. Applies disciplined initiative in absence of orders. Maintains standards for self and subordinates. Displays proper time management. Encourages positive behaviors and disciplines negative behaviors. Follows orderly practices in administrative, organizational, training, and operational duties. Consistently takes the easy way even if better ways exist. Unreliable. Lacks physical fitness. Displays non-professional behavior. Tolerates others’ inappropriate behavior. Inconsistently applies standard operating procedures. Views training as just another task to complete. Disorganized. Underlying Causes Failure to internalize Army Values and traditions. Lapses into complacency. Lacks the desire for excellence. Focuses on self-interest. Manages anger poorly. Lacks self-awareness and the ability to self-manage. Does not understand how favoritism undermines authority. Does not understand how to effectively communicate and enforce standards. Feedback Reflect on instances where you wished you had acted differently with respect to Army Values. Identify the attitudes or triggers that may have contributed to the situation. Consider your actions in a recent assignment. Do you maintain self-discipline? Do you make the right choices rather than the easy choices? Are you reliable and punctual? Compare how you manage time to others. Do you get as much done as they do or more? Are you prioritizing and getting the most important tasks done on time? Study Study the factors that prevent having good self-discipline (such as defense mechanisms, ego, restraint, or delayed gratification). Watch a role model demonstrate discipline. Ask how discipline is important to them, what are the pitfalls of slipping standards, how they maintain self-discipline. Review the “Discipline” exercise on the CAPL website and consider the facilitator questions. Think how you might incorporate what you learn into your life. Review the Inconvenient Discipline video exercise on the CAPL website and consider the facilitator questions.

Practice Think how you might incorporate the principles from the study activities. Practice taking various actions to act on those principles and creating good habits. Deliberately choose to adhere to the Army Values and other expected behavior. Take notes from the feedback and study steps about ways to improve controlling your behavior. Incorporate different actions to improve your routines. As you perform your duties, consider how others would view your discipline if they were aware of your thoughts or actions. Legend: CAPL Center for the Army Profession and Leadership IMI interactive media instruction HUMILITY 4-23. Humility, as an attribute of an Army leader’s character, is the absence of arrogance. To be a leader, one must be confident and competent. Effective leaders temper confidence with humility. However, it is often Chapter 4 4-12 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU difficult to judge one’s own humility. Humility is a subjective perception based on a leader’s behaviors and interpretations differ based on cultural or gender context. The attribute humility has one component: Seek feedback and explore personal performance (see table 4-12). 4-24. Humility exists on a continuum. Effective leaders exhibit an appropriate degree of humility. Others view a leader who expresses excess humility as being meek, timid, or overly passive. Conversely, others consider a leader who expresses too little humility as overconfident or arrogant. A leader lacking self- confidence may feel the need to hide any perception of weakness and may display arrogant behavior as a result while a self-confident individual is free to demonstrate humility. A leader who expresses too much or too little humility lacks self-awareness. This, in turn undermines confidence in the leader’s ability to make good decisions and achieve success. Table 4-12. Seek feedback and explore personal performance Strength Indicators Need Indicators A willing learner. Works toward something more important than self. Understands that they are part of a larger organization. Demonstrates accurate self-awareness. Expressing too much humility can come across as meek, timid, or passive. Expressing too little humility is seen as being overconfident and arrogant. Underlying Causes Characteristically arrogant, egotistical, and self-centered. Unaware of personal limitations and abilities. Unwarranted and excessive self-confidence. Weak ego, unwilling or unable to deal with failures due to self. Lacks self-confidence and feels the need to hide any perception of weakness. Feedback Explore your performance. Be willing to accept success and failure as possible outcomes and learn from both.

Army leaders are expected to look and act as professionals. Soldiers and DA Civilians displaying an unprofessional appearance do not send a professional message. The attribute military and professional bearing has two components: z Possess a commanding presence. z Project a professional image of authority. POSSESS A COMMANDING PRESENCE 4-26. Professional appearance and competence command respect. The impression a leader makes on others contributes to their success in leading. This impression is the sum of a leader’s outward appearance, demeanor, actions, and words (see table 4-13 on page 4-13). Learning and Developmental Activities 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 4-13 Table 4-13. Possess a commanding presence Strength Indicators Need Indicators Interacts with others professionally.

Lacks self-esteem. Professionally inexperienced. Does not engage in a regular physical fitness program. Does not practice holistic wellness: nutrition, fitness, rest, or positive relationships. Feedback Ask a peer with good command presence to observe your performance (such as briefing, speaking during formation). Ask for feedback on what went well and where to improve. Study Observe someone you feel exhibits this behavior well. Determine why you feel that way; emulate those behaviors. Assess your physical fitness level.

Remember that while presence might be difficult to achieve, unprofessional behavior easily undermines it. Legend: IMI interactive media instruction PROJECT A PROFESSIONAL IMAGE OF AUTHORITY 4-27. To command the respect of those led, a leader’s appearance must demonstrate their ability to lead themselves. A professional appearance and demeanor, as well as displays of competence, demonstrates a leader is ready to lead others (see table 4-14). Table 4-14. Project a professional image of authority Strength Indicators Need Indicators Dress is professional and tidy. Knowledgeable in the areas they lead. Comfortable delegating. Dress is sloppy.

The physical demands of leadership, deployments, and continual operations can erode more than physical attributes. Physical fitness and adequate rest support cognitive functioning and emotional stability, both essential for sound leadership (see table 4-15). If not physically fit before deployment, the effects of additional stress compromise mental and emotional fitness as well. Table 4-15. Have sound health, strength, and endurance Strength Indicators Need Indicators Scores high in physical fitness tests. Demonstrates emotional stability. Capable of working effectively for extended periods. Demonstrates balance in the non-physical domains of nutrition, mental, spiritual, and sleep readiness.

Legend: FM field manual IMI interactive media instruction CONFIDENCE 4-30. Confidence is important for both leaders and teams. Confident leaders demonstrate composure, which helps Soldiers mitigate self-doubt while reducing team anxiety. 4-31. The attribute confidence has two components: z Project self-confidence and certainty in the unit’s ability to succeed in its missions. z Demonstrate composure through control over personal emotions. PROJECT SELF-CONFIDENCE AND CERTAINTY 4-32. While confident leaders yield confident Soldiers (see table 4-16 on page 4-15), excessive confidence or pride can be as detrimental as too little confidence.Both extremes impede learning and adaptability in the unit’s ability to succeed in its missions.

Resilience is essential when pursuing mission accomplishment. Regardless of the working conditions, a strong personal attitude helps prevail over adverse external conditions. When things go badly, a leader must draw on inner reserves to persevere. The attribute resilience has one component: Recover quickly from adversity stress while maintaining focus (see table 4-18). 4-35. Resilient leaders learn and grow from experiencing adversity and use that growth to ensure positive outcomes for mission accomplishment. Adversity comes in many formats: setbacks, shock, injuries, and stress are only a few. Table 4-18. Recover quickly from adversity while maintaining focus Strength Indicators Need Indicators Treats adversity as a welcome challenge. Believes in personal ability to affect outcomes. Perceives adversity and challenge as opportunities for growth. Consistently stressed. Avoids difficult situations. Lacks self-confidence. Underlying Causes Lacks proper stress management skills. Physically unfit. Hindered by a previous trauma. Does not practice holistic health and fitness readiness: physical, nutrition, mental, spiritual, or sleep. Feedback Use a resilience self-assessment to think about factors that keep you from being affected negatively by stressors and how readily you bounce back from difficulties. Study Use resources from the Army Resilience Directorate to understand more about resilience, coping strategies, and managing daily stressors. Explore the Master Resilience Training Program to engage in self-awareness, self-regulation, optimism, mental agility, character, and connections. Practice Turn resilience into everyday habits by incrementally trying and adopting the associated competencies for resilience. MENTAL AGILITY 4-36. Mental agility is a flexibility of mind that allows leaders to adapt to uncertain or changing situations. Agility allows leaders to anticipate changing situations and think through second- and third-order effects. Mentally agile leaders develop and implement alternative approaches when current actions are not producing the desired results. Adaptation involves knowing or deciding whether to adapt, what to adapt to, over what timeframe to adapt, and how to adapt. Adaptability is enabled by— z Recognizing the need for change or recognize a need to act. z Knowing the cues that point to real, meaningful differences and cause-effect relationships. z Having a keen ability to discriminate among environmental cues. z Having flexible knowledge triggered from different cues. Useful knowledge is likely structured in modular chunks that can recombine in new ways. Understanding the principles and theory behind facts contributes to applying knowledge in novel ways. This characteristic is cognitive flexibility. z Seeing multiple sides of an issue and a drive to work toward the best one. Often, multiple sides need integration to derive the best perspective. Openness, seeing opposites, selecting the best of opposing approaches, designing compromise, or resolving contradictions aid integration. z Thinking in reverse time. This involves being able to think from a desired end state through the prior steps that reach it. It may involve going from constraints or possibilities to figure what is doable, what are plausible goals. z Handling multiple lines of thought. Involves tracking numerous issues or questions, prioritizing among them, remembering lesser issues while maintaining an overarching perspective, and returning to think about lesser issues when time is available. Learning and Developmental Activities 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 4-17 z Changing perspective. Referred to as decentering, this involves an ability to move away from one's center or viewpoint to overcome thinking obstacles and blind spots. z Thinking in progressively deeper ways. Involves thinking at the right level of depth and breadth that optimize effort on thinking to match the gravity of the situation. z Predicting. Involves going beyond first-order or obvious meaning, to broaden thinking to future classes of situations. z Visualizing and conceptualizing. Involves ability to imagine complex or unusual relationships, possibilities, or unforeseen consequences and relationships. z Thinking holistically. Involves seeing wholes, sets of relationships and interactions, instead of analytical, decomposed, individual, or isolated parts. Relates to an ability to "see" in dynamics— moving pictures—instead of a static snapshot. z Mentally simulating what could happen. Mental simulation is mentally constructing and thinking through a model of a problem, situation, or potential solution to determine important relationships. The process gauges how much action or resources it takes to create a noticeable difference in an outcome. 4-37. The attribute mental agility has three components: z Develop mental flexibility. z Anticipate or adapt to uncertain or changing situations. z Apply multiple perspectives and approaches. DEVELOP MENTAL FLEXIBILITY 4-38. A key component of being mentally agile is the ability to recognize when standard or historical means are no longer achieving the desired ends. Mentally agile leaders develop, evaluate, and implement alternative approaches (see table 4-19). Table 4-19. Develop mental flexibility Strength Indicators Need Indicators Develops innovative ideas for accomplishing tasks. Recognizes when current actions do not produce desired results. Implements alternative approaches. Persists with ineffective approaches. Does not learn from mistakes. Underlying Causes Does not engage in critical thinking.

When achieving the mission, mentally agile leaders must recognize a need for change, figure out what should change, and implement that change (see table 4-20). Leaders do not do this in a vacuum—they include the team. Table 4-20. Anticipate or adapt to uncertain or changing situations Strength Indicators Need Indicators Challenges key assumptions about decisions or plans. Considers alternatives to achieve a goal or mission. Seeks others’ input to achieve goals or missions. Does not consider alternative explanations. Does not solicit input from others. Repeats the same mistake more than once. Underlying Causes Does not engage in critical thinking. Does not trust personal abilities to improve tactics, techniques, or procedures. Adheres strictly to traditional approaches.

Legend: ATP Army techniques publication IMI interactive media instruction SOUND JUDGMENT 4-41. Sound judgment requires the ability to assess situations, draw rational conclusions, form educated opinions, make reliable estimates, and make sensible decisions. Problem solving, critical and creative thinking, and ethical reasoning are thought processes involved in understanding, visualizing, and directing. 4-42. Leaders draw on their knowledge and expertise in the context of each part of a problem. However, most situations have incomplete knowledge. Thinking is a technique to identify gaps in knowledge. Referencing past experiences can facilitate a new way of framing (seeing or structuring) a problem or a solution. Leaders test ideas through visualization or a war-gaming process. The thought process judges how well ideas meet goals. (See ATP 5-0.1 for information on the Army design methodology.) 4-43. The attribute sound judgment has two components: z Assess situations and draw sound conclusions. z Form sound opinions, sensible decisions, and reliable guesses. ASSESS SITUATIONS AND DRAW SOUND CONCLUSIONS 4-44. Assessing situations shrewdly often requires leaders to juggle facts, questionable data, and intuition to arrive at conclusions (see table 4-22). It requires transforming knowledge and information into understanding. Table 4-22. Assess situations and draw sound conclusions Strength Indicators Need Indicators Synthesizes multiple information streams. Questions information validity. Looks for problem root causes. Understands enemy weaknesses and determines how to exploit them. Makes uninformed decisions. Is reactive rather than proactive in solving problems.

Leaders motivate, inspire, and influence others to take initiative, work toward a common purpose, accomplish critical tasks, and achieve organizational objectives. Influence focuses on motivating and inspiring others to go beyond their individual interests and focus on contributing to the mission and the team’s common good. The leads others competency has four components: z Uses appropriate influence methods to energize others. z Provides purpose. z Enforces standards.z Balances mission and followers’ welfare. USES APPROPRIATE INFLUENCE METHODS TO ENERGIZE OTHERS 4-57. Army leaders can draw on multiple techniques to influence others ranging from obtaining compliance to building commitment to a cause or organization. Specific techniques for influence fall along a continuum including pressure, legitimate requests, exchange, personal appeals, collaboration, rational persuasion, apprising, inspiration, participation, and relationship building (see ADP 6-22 for more information). To Chapter 4 4-26 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU succeed in creating true commitment, leaders determine the proper influence technique based on the situation and individuals involved. Keep in mind that the influence effects are not often instantaneous. It may take time before seeing positive, enduring results (see table 4-31). Table 4-31. Uses appropriate influence methods to energize others Strength Indicators Needs Indicators Assesses the situation and determines the best influence technique to foster commitment. Considers the mission when exerting influence. Uses positive influence to do what is right. Uses pressure only when the stakes are high, time is short, and attempts at achieving commitment are not successful. Uses a single or limited number of influence techniques for all influence without considering the circumstances or individuals involved. Coerces or manipulates the situation for personal gain. Subordinates return several times to clarify what to do. Demonstrates abusive, cruel, or erratic behaviors to motivate others. Underlying Causes Lacks understanding of those to be influenced (values, needs, or opinions). Lacks awareness of likely effects (advantages and disadvantages) of influence techniques on others. Does not match the appropriate influence technique to the individual and does not factor in contextual causes (such as high operating tempo, significant stress, speed of situational changes). Focus on personal gain and accomplishment rather than doing what is right for the Army and the unit. Too forceful or not forceful enough when applying influence techniques. Belief that collaborative or rational approaches to gaining desired behavior weakens personal authority. Overly directive, relies on formal authority and rank to move others to action. Feedback Conduct reviews with team members and subordinates; listen for clues on the style and method of influence that works best for the team. Periodically speak with subordinates to ensure your influence creates a positive environment and aligns with Army expectations. Complete a self-assessment to understand the way you operate and its effect on your approach and style of influence. Talk to subordinates about what influence they find most effective with certain tasks. Study Proactively seek information to understand what is important to those you are trying to influence. Create the message to address the stakeholder’s key needs and concerns. Identify the appropriate influence technique by analyzing the criticality and time available for obtaining the desired behavior and the disposition of those you seek to influence. Observe and analyze different ways that you influence others noting what seems most effective for different tasks, situations, and individual dispositions. Consider the stresses, obligations, interests, values, and dispositions of those you are trying to influence. Choose influence techniques to produce the best results in these situations. Ensure the influence technique aligns with the Army Values, ethical principles, and the UCMJ. When leading a team, use the least coercive and most cooperative influence techniques under the circumstances to build and sustain task ownership and enhanced motivation.

Establishing and imparting a clear sense of intent and purpose gets work done by providing a distinct path forward. Often, with a firm sense of purpose, the result is easier to reach. Defining a clear sense of purpose can be difficult, as it requires thinking about the objective or task from a macro-level before implementing the details. However, developing clear intent and purpose can provide substantial benefits by clarifying required actions and resources as well as aligning team efforts (see table 4-32). Table 4-32. Provides purpose Strength Indicators Need Indicators Determines goals or objectives. Translates task goals and objectives into a sequenced action plan.

Fails to adapt to a situation’s complexity, ambiguity, or stress. Feedback Ask subordinates if the purpose and intent are clear. Have them backbrief the purpose and intent. Ask what could facilitate their understanding of what you are trying to convey. Talk to team members about the clarity of their task assignments. Do they understand how the work they complete contributes to organizational goals? Listen to feedback from superiors, peers, and subordinates about your communication skills. Determine which are effective or ineffective in imparting the mission purpose and intent. Study Study subordinates’ reactions when first establishing mission goals and purpose. Do their facial expressions and body language convey understanding or confusion? Identify a unit member who is a strong planner and mission briefer. Observe their actions. How do these actions compare to what you typically do? Study how other leaders impart clear purpose and intent to subordinates. Discuss the thought process for identifying, planning, and communicating purpose and intent. Examine vision statements or past operations orders.

To lead others and gauge correct duty performance, the Army has established standards for military activities. Standards are formal, detailed instructions to describe, measure, and achieve. To use standards effectively, leaders should explain the standards that apply to the organization and give subordinates the authority to enforce them (see table 4-33). Table 4-33. Enforces standards Strength Indicators Need Indicators Reinforces standards’ importance and role. Explains the standards and their significance. Prioritizes unit activities to ensure not everything is a number one priority. Ensures tasks meet established standards.

Study Learn established Army standards for individual and collective tasks expected of the unit. Research how successful leaders have established, communicated, monitored, and enforced individual and collective standards. Consult with superiors about organizational standards most critical to attaining the higher commander’s vision and intent. Consider how these standards pertain to the unit. Practice When assigning tasks, explicitly state performance standard and expectations. When assigning performance standards, explain why the standard is essential for organizational success. Set the tone when involved with any individual or group task. Ensure to always give your best effort and model an example for the team to follow. Recognize team members who exemplify the standards you are trying to reinforce. Identify individuals who repeatedly fail to achieve performance standards; address appropriately. When receiving a mission, verify the standard expected––is it appropriate or necessary? BALANCES MISSION AND FOLLOWERS’ WELFARE 4-60. Team welfare is vital to completing a mission while maintaining morale. Taking care of followers creates closer working relationships. Leaders must be able to keep an eye on the mission while being cognizant of and caring for the people working for them (see table 4-34 on page 4-29).

Seek counsel from a mentor or trusted advisor when dealing with a difficult situation. Have them guide you and provide insight into possible next steps. Discuss proposed missions with other unit leaders to assess the adverse effects of mission execution on unit members’ welfare. Have mental health professionals survey the organization for evidence of excessive stress. Obtain summary information and recommendations for reducing stress levels. Study Investigate relief activities and methods to counter stress. See what worked well for other leaders and what to do better. Regularly assess and document both team and individual morale. Identify the organization’s greatest sources of stress. Look for methods to reduce stress. Research signs of stress so that you can recognize a problem before it becomes an issue. Learn post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and effects so you can identify it and obtain appropriate help for unit members. Consider a leader who succeeded in balancing member welfare with severe demands or stresses faced by the unit. How did they do it? What behaviors and methods can you model to ensure your success? Consider what messages your behavior sends about balancing personal welfare and mission requirements. Access the Central Army Registry to complete L29 IMI−Managing Time. Practice Observe subordinate morale daily. Are they struggling with the workload? Is it affecting group morale? Brainstorm possible solutions to team members’ workloads with other unit leaders. Take advantage of opportunities to give subordinates time off when the mission permits. Compare the importance of the intended mission outcomes against the likely costs imposed on team members. Look for ways to minimize costs while still obtaining benefits. Legend: IMI interactive media instruction BUILDS TRUST 4-61. Trust is essential to all effective relationships, particularly within the Army. Trust facilitates a bond between Soldiers, leaders, the Army, and the Nation that enables mission success. 4-62. Building trust forms on the bedrock of mutual respect, shared understanding, and common experiences. For teams and organizations to function at the highest level, a climate of trust needs to exist. Leaders create Chapter 4 4-30 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU a climate of trust by displaying consistency in their actions, and through relationship-building behaviors such as coaching, counseling, and mentoring. The competency builds trust has three components: z Sets personal example for trust. z Takes direct actions to build trust. z Sustains a climate of trust. SETS PERSONAL EXAMPLE FOR TRUST 4-63. Leaders exhibit their beliefs about trust in their actions and behaviors. Setting a personal example inspires those around them to act in the same manner. The actions a leader models to subordinates communicates the values of the leader and the unit. Setting a personal example for trust should be consistent and is the most powerful tool a leader has to shape the organizational climate (see table 4-35). Table 4-35. Sets personal example for trust Strength Indicators Need Indicators Follows through on commitments and promises. Presents the truth, even if unpopular or difficult. Protects and safeguards confidential information. Admits mistakes. Keeps confidences. Shows respect for others; remains firm and fair. Acts with great integrity and character.

Unable to maintain a position and follow through. Overly focused on personal ambition and welfare. Avoids conflict. Uncomfortable with how others respond to the truth. Fails to deliver on promises. Feedback Get feedback on organization behaviors that demonstrate a high degree of trust. These may include open communication, collaboration, strong innovation, and clear work expectations. Observe your behavior. Be as objective as possible.Assess if you treat others equitably and fairly––do you have favorites? Get feedback to support your assessment. Contact others outside the unit and find out how to build greater trust, openness, and mutual understanding to achieve common goals. Complete a trust self-assessment. Informal tools are available through online searches. Study Observe the behaviors of other leaders who you think are trustworthy. What behaviors do they exhibit that build and maintain trust? List what they do that you want to model. Study personal behaviors. Analyze if you consistently follow up on commitments less than others do. If so, ask or explore why. Learn from mistakes by writing out alternative actions you might have taken. Access the Central Army Registry to complete L19 IMI−Building Working Relationships across Boundaries and L23 IMI−Building Trust.

Building trust is not a passive exercise. Leaders develop trust in their organizations by taking actions to promote trust. Developing others through mentoring, coaching, and counseling builds trust. When a leader mentors effectively, they send a clear message: I trust you to build a stronger, more adaptable Army and continue the Army profession. Leaders build trust by developing positive relationships with peers, superiors, and subordinates (see table 4-36). Leaders do not tolerate misconduct or unfair treatment and take appropriate action to correct unit dysfunction. Table 4-36. Takes direct actions to build trust Strength Indicators Need Indicators Mentors, coaches, and counsels leaders. Demonstrates care for others.

A climate of trust requires that unit norms and values create a positive, mutually beneficial environment characterized by openness and risk-tolerance. Leaders sustain this environment by consistently demonstrating these values through their decisions and actions and communicating to others that they will not tolerate misconduct. Note that leaders setting an example and directing action to build trust are important tools to sustain a climate of trust (see table 4-37). Table 4-37. Sustains a climate of trust Strength Indicators Need Indicators Assesses recurring conditions that promote or hinder trust. Informs people on goals, actions, and results. Follows through on actions related to others’ expectations. Under-promises and over-delivers. Maintains high unit morale. Appears insensitive to what promotes or hinders trust. Demonstrates poor communication of goals, actions, and results to others. Shows inconsistency in attitudes or behaviors, does not follow through on actions. Over-promises and under-delivers. Enables poor unit morale. Underlying Causes Overall lack of leadership experience. Insensitivity to the conditions that help create trust or hinder it. General lack of transparency in decision-making. Anxiety about others’ perceptions, wants to please. Inability to commit to a particular course of action. Overly ambitious, not focused on the team or causes larger than self. Feedback Regularly meet with key staff to gather feedback on both unit and individual morale, the level of openness in the unit, and factors (positive and negative) which may be influencing trust. Use instruments such as Command Climate Surveys and other assessments to assess unit morale regularly. Low morale often indicates a lack of trust. Encourage frequent informal feedback on unit climate. Note: others model the values and tone set by a leader. Reward candid, informal feedback. Build trust by acting on the feedback received. If the feedback on climate reveals a weakness in the unit, rebuild trust. Study Regularly observe individuals and teams performing their duties during typical operations and training to gauge the existing level of trust. Notice when a climate is distrustful. Study the factors that contributed to the loss of trust. Study inspiring leaders (civilian or military) who created climates of trust in their units, teams, or organizations.

Leaders can influence beyond their direct line of authority and chain of command. Influence can extend across units, unified action partners, and other groups. Creating and communicating a common vision and building agreement is crucial. In these situations, leaders use indirect means of influence, diplomacy, negotiation, mediation, arbitration, partnering, conflict resolution, consensus building, and coordination. 4-67. This competency has two components: z Understands sphere, means and limits of influence. z Negotiates, builds consensus, and resolves conflict. UNDERSTANDS SPHERE, MEANS, AND LIMITS OF INFLUENCE 4-68. Leading and influencing others outside established organizational structures requires specific skills and abilities. Assessing others’ roles outside the chain of command, knowing over whom they have authority and influence, and understanding how they are likely to exert that influence is important. By learning about people outside of the chain of command, understanding their interests and viewpoints, and being familiar with internal relationships within the organization, leaders can identify influence techniques likely to work beyond the command chain. Individuals can adjust influence techniques to the situation and parties involved (see table 4-38). Table 4-38.

Practice what you preach. Demonstrate upholding the Army’s Values to others. EXEMPLIFIES THE WARRIOR ETHOS/SERVICE ETHOS 4-72. The Warrior Ethos and Service Ethos refer to a set of specific professional attitudes and beliefs that characterize the American Soldier and DA Civilian. The Warrior Ethos shapes and guides a leader’s actions on and off the battlefield. Leaders demonstrate the Warrior Ethos or Service Ethos anytime they experience prolonged and demanding conditions that require commitment and resilience to do what is right despite adversity, challenge, and setback (see table 4-41 on page 4-37). For example, tirelessly advocating for a more comprehensive training program on leader development demonstrates the Service Ethos, just a Soldier taking charge of an isolated element demonstrates the Warrior Ethos. 4-73. While DA Civilians can have a warrior-like ethos, a service ethos fittingly describes the attitudes of DA Civilians who choose to serve the public interest through support and defense of the Constitution. They are committed to the Army and the Constitution and take an oath upon their hiring similar to the oath Soldiers take. In honoring the Service Ethos, DA Civilians support the needs of the Army and its Soldiers. Learning and Developmental Activities 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 4-37 Table 4-41.

LEADS WITH CONFIDENCE IN ADVERSE SITUATIONS 4-74. The opportunity to lead with confidence in adverse situations happens frequently but making the right decisions in difficult times defines an Army leader’s career. Mistakenly, individuals often believe that leading with confidence in adverse situations is a responsibility reserved for senior leaders, and do not recognize the need for confident leadership at all levels. How Army leaders approach and persevere through difficult times sets a leadership example for others while demonstrating commitment to the organization (see table 4-42 on page 4-38).

Legend: IMI interactive media instruction COMMUNICATES 4-78. Leaders communicate by clearly expressing ideas and actively listening to others. By understanding the nature and importance of communication and practicing effective communication techniques, leaders Chapter 4 4-42 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU relate better to others and translate goals into actions. Communication is essential to all other leadership competencies and has four components: z Creates shared understanding. z Listens actively. z Employs engaging communication techniques. z Sensitive to cultural factors in communication. CREATES SHARED UNDERSTANDING 4-79. Leaders understand the unit’s mission and develop plans to meet mission goals. Leaders owe it to subordinates, the organization, and unified action partners to share information that directly applies to their duties and provides the necessary context for what needs to be done (see table 4-46). Keeping team members informed aligns the organization, relieves stress, and shows appreciation for team members. Table 4-46.

Do not overload the team with information. Offer information in segments for understanding without causing confusion and conveys the complete story. Legend: ASAP as soon as possible IMI interactive media instruction LISTENS ACTIVELY 4-80. The most important purpose of listening is to comprehend the speaker’s thoughts and internalize them. Throughout a conversation, listeners should pay attention to what the speaker is trying to communicate. Active listeners have a lot to focus on—multiple verbal and nonverbal cues, the content of the message the speaker is trying to deliver, and the speaker’s urgency and emotion (see table 4-47). Stay alert for common themes that recur with the speaker as well as inconsistencies or completely avoided topics. Table 4-47. Listens actively Strength Indicators Need Indicators Pays attention to nonverbal cues. Asks questions to clarify meaning when not understanding the speaker’s point.

Feels uncomfortable with the topic, information, or emotions the speaker is sharing. Believes that personal way is the only way; does not listen to others' opinions. Distracted by time pressure, other concerns, or environmental factors. Feedback If you do not understand what the speaker tries to communicate, ask them to restate the idea. Paraphrase what the speaker said before responding. Use wording like “So, you’re saying....” Ask others, at work or in your network, how you can improve active listening skills. At the close of a conversation, recap or summarize the main points and the motivations that may be behind them. Note trends and themes from the discussion. Study During daily activities, observe someone you feel is a strong listener interacting with someone else. What makes that person a good listener? What verbal and nonverbal cues are used? Learn what limits active listening. Consider how often you say “Yes, but....” or “Let’s get to the point.” Do you check your mobile device or continue to type on the computer during conversations? These behaviors display an unwillingness to listen and limit conversation. Find out if you are a selective listener by observing what topics, what people, and in what settings you are or are not an active listener.

Employ verbal prompts, such as ‘Yes....’, ‘Go on....’, and ‘Tell me more.’, and nonverbal prompts, such as nodding, leaning toward them, and eye contact to encourage them to talk. During conversations, focus on what the speaker is saying rather than forming your argument. Minimize external distractions: turn off mobile devices, close the door, go where you can be with the speaker one-on-one, or ask to meet the speaker later to focus on what they have to say. Do not argue mentally with them. It distracts you from listening to what they are trying to convey. Take notes that identify important points or items for clarification during meetings. Review your notes and follow-up with an email or conversation if it remains unclear. Legend: IMI interactive media instruction EMPLOYS ENGAGING COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES 4-81. Leaders must deliver a message clearly and succinctly to the unit or subordinates to ensure shared understanding (see table 4-48).

To build a positive climate, leaders should use consistent but flexible policies and viewpoints in treating others with respect. While leaders should treat all team members fairly and consistently, not everyone will be treated exactly the same since not all have the same strengths or needs. Fairness means that no one gets preferential treatment but leaves leeway for team member capabilities and needs. Inclusiveness means that all are valued and accepted into the organization, regardless of differences (see table 4-58). Table 4-58.

Set a self-development example by sharing opportunities related to developmental activities or training. During the next unit briefing, emphasize the importance of seeking others’ counsel. Couch it in the context of the Army’s organization-wide commitment to life-long learning. Legend: CAPL Center for the Army Profession and Leadership IMI interactive media instruction ENCOURAGES OPEN AND CANDID COMMUNICATIONS 4-98. Good leaders encourage collaboration through open and candid communication to create environments where others feel free to contribute and know their ideas and input are valued. Creating an open environment is a key to developing a unit capable of responding to change. Leaders who value and reinforce open and Chapter 4 4-60 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU candid communications show respect for subordinate opinions, recognize others’ viewpoints, and encourage input and feedback (see table 4-62). Table 4-62. Encourages open and candid communications Strength Indicators Need Indicators Guards against groupthink; reinforces importance of expressing contrary and minority viewpoints. Remains calm, objective, and facts-focused when receiving potentially bad news. Encourages input and feedback during change. Respects others’ opinions even in disagreement. Exhibits positive attitude to encourage others and improve morale. Displays appropriate reactions to new or conflicting information or opinions. Guards against groupthink. Demeans team member and subordinate opinions either consciously or subconsciously. Halts conversation when it appears to move toward a change in unit processes or practices. Reacts viscerally or angrily when receiving bad news or conflicting information. Shares information and understanding with select favorites who disseminate information to the rest. Demonstrates non-verbal behavior that keeps others from sharing input (such as frowning, checking mobile devices, or ignoring others when speaking). Underlying Causes Concerned that too much open communication can lead to too much talking and not enough doing. Wants to stay true to the current unit direction provided by superiors. Has too many simultaneous tasks moving forward to take time to hear others' ideas. Does not fully understand the relationship between an open environment and adapting to change. Adapts poorly (emotionally or cognitively) to unforeseen problems, bad news, or conflicting information. Feels the need to control information. Fails to address others’ behavior that impedes effective communication. Feedback Hold monthly updates where members share information and provide status on tasks. Hold a brainstorming session or forum with team members to discuss possible solutions to obstacles currently impeding progress. Ask for opinions on how to remove the obstacle. Hold regular unit meetings to discuss internal operations and ongoing issues. Stress taking initiative, underwriting honest mistakes, and continual improvement. Ensure team members feel comfortable presenting their thoughts and ideas. If they are uncomfortable, converse one-on-one to seek their feedback and input into the process. Lead by example. Ask for feedback from team members and subordinates on your ideas. If they produce a good idea or insight, incorporate it into a new initiative. Study Observe a leader whose unit has an open communications environment. Incorporate their approach into personal practices. Take a course on soliciting input and open communications. Ensure the course has hands-on examples and scenarios so you can practice improving your skills. Reflect upon your communication style. Is it conducive to the open and candid flow of information and ideas? Note things to improve and incorporate these changes. Research how to foster an open communications environment.

As a leader, one of the greatest challenges is to encourage subordinates to exercise initiative, accept responsibility, and take ownership. Subordinates may hesitate to step forward and express their knowledge or provide information because they fear they are wrong or do not want additional tasks. A leader builds a subordinate’s confidence to solve problems and accept responsibility, sets conditions that foster taking initiative, and encourages input from anyone who understands the subject matter (see table 4-63). Table 4-63. Encourages subordinates Strength Indicators Need Indicators Encourages subordinates to explore new approaches to a problem. Pushes decision making to the lowest appropriate level to encourage subordinate responsibility and empowerment. Involves others in decisions; informs them of consequences that affect them. Involves subordinates in tasks to ensure ownership and accountability. Guides team members and subordinates in thinking through problems for themselves. Reinforces and rewards initiative. Hesitates to consider or incorporate subordinates’ suggestions into Army unit tasks. Defines the course for most tasks without consulting team members or experienced subordinates. Uses only approved approaches to solving problems or completing tasks. Uses only the same small cadre of team members to support decision-making. Takes time to inform a subordinate on how to perform all aspects of a specific task. Treats Soldiers’ honest mistakes as things to avoid or prevent—not as opportunities to learn. Underlying Causes Satisfied with the status quo; does not seek to improve the unit. Feels a lack of control when delegating decision-making authority to subordinates. Has insufficient time to help subordinates think through problems; has trouble trusting others’ judgments. Feels that subordinates are not stepping up to take on new opportunities and challenges. Feels that delegating decision-making to lower levels compromises mission success. Feedback When presented with a new task, interview interested team members. Select the best candidate. With new tasks, brainstorm with team members to discuss possible solutions to obstacles currently impeding progress. Ask for opinions on how to remove obstacles. Hold regular unit meetings to discuss internal operations and ongoing issues. Stress taking initiative, underwriting honest mistakes, and continual improvement. Check-in with team members to ensure they do not feel overwhelmed making critical decisions. Study Take a course or training on delegation and implement learned techniques on-duty. Consult a mentor to discuss your delegating skills. Create tangible practices to use on-duty. Observe a peer or superior who is adept at delegating responsibility. Examine their process for selecting subordinates and communicating responsibility and expectations. Allocate time to create an initiatives wish list that you as a leader would like to take on. Share the list with team members and subordinates and discuss how to make wish list items a reality. Read a reference book or article to learn about effectively encouraging subordinates to exercise initiative, accept responsibility, and take ownership. Access the Central Army Registry to complete L06 IMI−Supporting the Developing Leader, L07 IMI−Creating and Supporting Challenging Job Assignments, and L22 IMI−Enabling Subordinates Using Mission-Focused Delegation.

Army leaders should cultivate physical and mental health by being logical and clear-headed when making decisions. Leaders who emphasize mental and physical health and well-being inspire confidence in subordinates and set an example of how to balance the inherent stresses of both personal and professional life (see table 4-64). Improving personal holistic health and fitness are tactics for promoting health, encouraging mental clarity, and inspiring similar outcomes in others. Table 4-64. Demonstrates care for follower well-being Strength Indicators Need Indicators Ensures subordinates’ and their families’ health, welfare, and development are provided for. Monitors morale and encourages honest feedback. Sets a personal example for colleagues. Nurtures long-term well-being through rigorous training and preparation. Understands and nurtures subordinates’ intrinsic motivators. Sends a subordinate home after working long hours. Gives subordinate time off to deal with family matters. Unwilling to decline taskings even when the unit is overburdened or at the breaking point. Fails to provide family and individual support needs. Takes credit for unit success or unfairly blames subordinates when failures are experienced. Ignores morale indicators and promotes overly optimistic feedback. Does not share in the hardships experienced by Soldiers. Coddles subordinates with easy, comfortable training. Underlying Causes Wishes to avoid controversial or critical decision-making. Wants to please, impress, and create a positive impression to superiors (such as not declining taskings). Focused on accomplishing the short-term mission without sufficient concern for the long-term needs and well- being of Soldiers and their families. Expects more of subordinates than self. Prizes personal relationships over the organization’s health, welfare, and safety. Expects subordinates to be self-sufficient or capable of addressing issues independently. Feedback Encourage others to share candid opinions, reiterating that you welcome different perspectives. Speak with the team and their families to determine how you can better serve them. Solicit feedback from subordinates on specific issues affecting morale to understand issues. Ask subordinates to explain a range of perspectives on an issue rather than only their opinions. Discuss with the team how to improve training exercises to meet specific objectives. Seek feedback from trusted subordinates regarding their unit welfare and morale perceptions, including families. Identify potential stressors or factors negatively affecting the unit and work with subordinates to identify ways to address them. Study Observe the behaviors of other leaders you admire. Note how these leaders make difficult decisions that balance Soldier welfare with mission accomplishment. While maintaining awareness of Army programs, identify and investigate programs offered by local communities and social service organizations that may help Soldiers and their families. Reflect upon your actions to balance Soldier and family welfare with mission accomplishment. When your actions fail to maintain this balance, reflect upon your motivations. Question the value of training exercises. Are they rigorous for rigor’s sake or do they serve a specific objective, such as safer or more efficient operations? Access the Central Army Registry to complete L21 IMI−Seeking and Delivering Face-to-Face Feedback. Practice Set aside social time with subordinates, peers, and their families. These activities can help develop compassion and provide insight for ways to help meet their needs. Draft a vision statement of how you want members to be treated. When the unit’s treatment does not live up to your standards, identify improvement objectives to implement. Create a record of each time you rebuke a peer or subordinate for failing to live up to set standards. In the record, include when you failed to meet the same standard. Have subordinates and peers explain their understanding for specific training exercises. Seeing the links among training, safety, and effectiveness leads to respect of training rigor. Legend: IMI interactive media instruction Learning and Developmental Activities 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 4-63 DEVELOPS OTHERS 4-101. Leaders encourage and support others to grow as individuals and teams. They facilitate achieving organizational goals through assisting others to develop. They prepare others to assume new positions elsewhere in the organization, making the organization more versatile and productive. This competency has four components: z Assesses others’ developmental needs. z Counsels, coaches, and mentors. z Facilitates ongoing development. z Builds team skills and processes. ASSESSES OTHERS’ DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS 4-102. Regular counseling and evaluation of subordinates allows leaders to have a greater knowledge of their capabilities—including their strengths and limitations. This knowledge can help optimize Soldier and unit performance (via improved staffing decisions)—it demonstrates to Soldiers that leaders care about their performance and their development. Investing time and resources into team members’ and subordinates’ developmental needs fosters enhanced well-being for the individual and leads to improved unit and Army performance (see table 4-65). Table 4-65. Assesses others’ developmental needs Strength Indicators Need Indicators Identifies subordinate internal drivers and uses those motivators to analyze developmental needs. Gathers information about a subordinate’s developmental needs from multiple sources. Reviews assessments or reports about a subordinate’s interests or capabilities. Observes and monitors subordinates under different conditions. Helps subordinates develop IDPs. Gathers information about a subordinate’s performance from only one source or a few times. Assesses Soldiers on a small number of performance dimensions or competencies. Reviews only one completed assessment or report. Notices subordinates only when challenged. Generalizes subordinates’ leadership patterns, strengths, and developmental needs based on limited observation. Underlying Causes Does not allocate the necessary time to get to know subordinates and understand their developmental needs. Too busy to actively monitor subordinate performance on the full range of performance competencies. Lacks clear understanding of subordinates' position requirements. Uncomfortable delivering constructive feedback. Time pressures hinder ability to provide immediate feedback. Views an individual's continual development as a low-ranking priority. Feedback Hold development discussions with subordinates at least once every three months. Integrate these discussions into the typical duty hours. Communicate to people that their work is important, even if it is simply saying, “Thank you, I appreciate your hard work.” Be open and tactfully forthright with people when discriminating between subordinates’ developmental needs. Make decisions in the Army’s best interest. Elicit input and feedback from subordinates on unit developmental needs. Chapter 4 4-64 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Table 4-65. Assesses others’ developmental needs (continued) Study Become familiar with subordinates’ personal and career goals, as appropriate. Become knowledgeable of subordinates’ roles, responsibilities, and duty requirements. This provides a better understanding of what right looks like to aid Soldier evaluations. During a usual workday, analyze the organization’s overall approach to managing multiple priorities. How does this approach affect subordinates and their developmental needs? Observe another leader analyzing a subordinate’s developmental needs. What communication skills are used? Record the questions asked, language used, balance between positive and negative feedback, and time spent listening. Read a reference book or learn from listed resources. Review counseling and coaching resources on the CAPL website.Practice Allocate time during the duty day to help subordinates create and implement an IDP. Have subordinates identify only one or two concrete goals at a time to build confidence and decrease frustration with vague, overly ambitious goals. Set up an office hour each week during which subordinates can freely come to talk with you about their developmental needs. Spend time daily among your Soldiers to observe their performance first-hand, talk with them about their duties, give immediate feedback, and talk with noncommissioned officers and junior officers observing Soldier performance. Demonstrate Soldier performance is a priority. Legend: CAPL Center for the Army Profession and Leadership IDP    individual development plan COUNSELS, COACHES, AND MENTORS 4-103. Counseling, coaching, and mentoring stand as the principal ways by which leaders provide others with knowledge and feedback. Counseling occurs when leaders review with the subordinate their demonstrated performance and potential; coaching occurs when you guide another’s development in new or existing skills through the practice of self-actualization; and mentoring occurs when you have greater experience than a mentee and guide and advise the mentee in their professional growth (see table 4-66). Table 4-66. Counsels, coaches, and mentors Strength Indicators Need Indicators Sets up regular counseling, coaching, or mentoring sessions with subordinates. Clearly defines the purpose of counseling, coaching, or mentoring sessions. Encourages subordinates through actions while guiding them. Helps someone understand their current performance; Instructs and guides on how to reach the next level of knowledge and skill. Candidly discusses a subordinate’s strengths, needs, and courses of action to improve. Inconsistent or infrequent up counseling sessions. Counsels or mentors only those subordinates considered to have the most potential. Uses a one-size-fits-all mentality when designing counseling, coaching, and mentoring sessions. Fails to provide coaching and feedback during duty— provides feedback only during scheduled sessions. Avoids providing negative feedback. Talks at subordinates instead of with subordinates. Displays personal biases (such as likes, dislikes, or prejudices) and judges too rashly. Underlying Causes Busy with other duties so that coaching, counseling, and mentoring have a lower priority. Allocates insufficient time for counseling, coaching, and mentoring sessions. Does not see value in spending time and resources on counseling, coaching, or mentoring subordinates perceived as having little potential. Avoids personal conflict with subordinates; has difficulty telling subordinates things they may not want to hear.

Let’s catch up.” Seek out on-duty or in-the-moment opportunities to reinforce or coach on specific issues, making links to broader developmental goals for that individual. Emphasize to subordinates the benefits of taking time to engage in developmental activities. Focus on the benefits it provides to the unit and the Army. Spend time walking around the unit each day. This provides opportunities to observe and provide immediate feedback and coaching to subordinates.

Fails to stay current on individual and organizational development programs. Displays ambivalence toward opportunities for self- development. Selects only some subordinates to take advantage of developmental opportunities. Adopts an “I’ll do it all” mentality—fails to identify tasks for delegation. Ignores obstacles to development. Underlying Causes Unable to devote time to stay current on individual and organizational development programs. Feels that the organization will suffer if too many members are engaged in developmental activities. Feels that individual development should be left up to the individual. Believes that mission or task effectiveness might suffer through delegation. Not personally affected by developmental obstacles so treats them as if they do not exist. Feedback Ask unit members to help identify any obstacles to development that exist. Request that they provide recommendations for eliminating the identified obstacles. Ask subordinates you counsel, coach, or mentor what you can do to support their development or better support unit development. Have a conversation with a superior about how well you are supporting development. Then ask them to share successful tips and tricks they have learned. Talk with a leader from another organization about ways to facilitate ongoing development. Share what you learned with your unit. Ask trusted unit members how they think you support training and development activities that occur during the workday and self-development that takes place on personal time. Study Allocate time to research development programs available to your subordinates. Recommend specific programs to individuals based on their developmental needs. Investigate other organizations’ development practices (such as sister Services or private sector companies) and incorporate their techniques if possible.

Effective cooperation and communication in (and between) teams facilitates unit success. Indeed, no single person, squad, platoon, company, battalion, or brigade ever won a war; it was the collaboration and teamwork at and between each level that enabled mission success. Table 4-68.

Provides minimal resources and support. Fails to spend sufficient time on group dynamics and relationships. Focuses on individual subordinates’ efforts and successes. Conducts training exercises, but never provides teamwork-specific feedback. Fails to prioritize team goals over individual goals. Underlying Causes Does not have the time or desire to help teams accomplish challenging assignments. More comfortable and experience teaching through lecture than through experiential activities. Unaware of the importance of providing teamwork-specific feedback. Feels that encouraging individual achievement is a more effective motivator than providing feedback and targeting motivation to groups or teams. Does not communicate the importance of teamwork. Feedback Ask subordinates about activities they engage in outside the Army that require teamwork. Compile these examples and share any best practices with the unit. Survey the unit through an open-ended questionnaire to determine how well you support team building and improving group skills and processes. Determine what works well, what is not working, and how to enhance team performance. Following a training exercise, incorporate feedback specifically related to teamwork and skill building as part of the review. Whenever you conduct training exercises, ensure you reference and reinforce the teamwork lessons learned so the unit remembers the role of teamwork in completed activities. Study Assess how well you interact with other team leaders. Are you soliciting input from lower-ranking team members and making them feel like their input is valued? Observe another leader engaging in a team-building exercise with their unit. Record the activities they perform and any feedback about what went well or needs improvement.

In planning, leaders must think beyond their current team, mission, and direct chain of leadership. Leaders steward the profession when they act to improve the organization even when the effects may not be realized until after their tenure. Stewarding the profession is about life-long learning, commitment to an effective future organization, and developing others. This competency has two components: z Improves the organization. z Supports professional and personal growth. IMPROVES THE ORGANIZATION 4-107. Leaders demonstrate stewardship when they act to improve the organization for not only the present but also the future Army (see table 4-69). Acting to improve the organization involves prioritizing and managing people and resources when the effect may not be immediately evident. Leaders who steward the profession have a lasting concern over how their decisions affect the organization’s future. Table 4-69.

Have a conversation with a superior about how well you are supporting development. Ask them to share tips and strategies that they have found effective. Talk with a leader from another unit about how to facilitate Soldier participation in professional military education courses without compromising unit effectiveness. Talk to subordinates about the benefits of institutionally-based development: to meet and network with others outside their chain of command and share ideas and best practices. Study Consider when you nominated someone to take advantage of a developmental opportunity. Analyze your reasons for nominating them. Look for patterns or potential biases. Set aside appropriate time to investigate available Army developmental opportunities so you are able talk about development with team members and subordinates.

A leader’s ultimate purpose is to get results by accomplishing missions the right way. A leader gets results by providing guidance and managing resources as well as demonstrating the other leader competencies. This competency focuses on consistent and ethical task accomplishment through supervising, managing, monitoring, and guiding the team’s work. Taken together, these components of gets results require initiative on the part of the leader to make decisions, take action to solve problems, and accomplish the mission: z Prioritizes, organizes, and coordinates taskings. z Identifies and accounts for individual and group capabilities and commitment. z Designates, clarifies, and deconflicts duties and responsibilities. z Identifies, contends for, allocates, and manages resources. z Removes work obstacles. z Recognizes and rewards good performance. z Seeks, recognizes, and takes advantage of opportunities to improve performance. z Makes feedback part of work processes. z Executes plans to accomplish the mission. z Identifies and adjusts to external influences on the mission and organization. PRIORITIZES, ORGANIZES, AND COORDINATES TASKINGS 4-110. Leaders are responsible for coordinating all the simultaneous team undertakings and resourcing subordinates to complete the mission properly. Army leaders must be detailed planners who actively organize and communicate priorities to their team to ensure task execution in the right place, at the right time, in the right operational environment (see table 4-71).

Legend: IMI interactive media instruction RECOGNIZES AND REWARDS GOOD PERFORMANCE 4-115. Leaders usually regard rewards as incentives to influence others’ behavior, so they perform in desirable ways beneficial to the organization (see table 4-76 on page 4-76). They benefit Army leaders and team members who work to achieve more than is typically expected. Often, rewards relate closely to motivation and morale and can make an organization a place where its members strive to achieve results. Chapter 4 4-76 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Table 4-76.

Underlying Causes Unaware of the value of recognition and reward for good work as part of leadership. Unable to see the link between reward and recognition and increased performance or productivity. Pays little attention to monitoring or observing subordinates. Does not treat people as individuals or recognize that different rewards and recognitions motivate different individuals. Focuses on personal achievement at others’ expense. Feedback Get feedback from subordinates on their grasp of the performance standards for their work. Recognize that rewards are specific to each individual, so it is important to understand what specific motivators are particularly rewarding for each individual. Assess your approach to rewarding and recognizing subordinates. Observe factors like frequency, types of rewards, and who gets recognized. Acknowledge what individuals or teams contribute; relate appropriate rewards. Before recognizing an individual or team, discuss your rationale for the reward with a trusted leader who is familiar with the situation. Ask for feedback on your justification and rationale. Ask subordinates for feedback upon receiving a reward. Did they agree with the performance standards and rationale for the reward? Was the reward appropriate to the accomplishment? Study Observe subordinates to determine and document what motivates them. Consider how to reward individuals and teams. Reward desired behaviors. For example, organizations often stress the importance of teamwork but reward exemplary individuals rather than teams. Create a matrix that matches members of the team and the reward types they value most. Analyze whether an accomplishment was due to one or several individuals or a team. Identify a unit member that appears to successfully reward and recognize superior performance. How does their behavior compare to yours in providing rewards and recognition? Access the Central Army Registry to complete L09 IMI−Motivating through Rewards. Practice Reward high achievement rather than routine work. Devise appropriate rewards for individuals and teams. Create incentives that boost subordinate morale and motivation. Consider granting time off, recognizing birthdays, or planning team events. Regularly observe productivity; provide feedback or praise as appropriate. Provide on-the-spot praise or awards for work that exceeds expectations. Reward instances where subordinates demonstrate innovative thought or creativity in their approach, even if unsuccessful. This conveys to others that these attributes are valued. Legend: IMI interactive media instruction SEEKS, RECOGNIZES, AND TAKES ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES 4-116. The individual who recognizes and takes advantage of opportunities to improve performance is a strong critical thinker who recognizes each completed task as a learning experience.

Feels uncomfortable providing negative feedback or discussing areas for improvement. Believes feedback should be corrective (such as what is not working) rather than supportive. Lacks knowledge in how to deliver constructive feedback to guide subordinates toward success. Feedback Ask subordinates for feedback on the frequency and quality of performance feedback you provide. Do subordinates consider it helpful and timely? Do they modify their behaviors? Informally gain input from the team after completing a task or project. Collect the input first without offering feedback. Use information in a formal after action review. Assess the frequency and quality of feedback you provide. Note who, when, and indications of how it was received. Seek a trusted subordinate’s input to verify your assessment. Ensure subordinates understand what you communicate through feedback loops or ask questions such as: How will you implement this? What will you take away from our discussion? What changes do you plan to make immediately? Observe someone who provides accurate, effective, and frequent feedback. Determine if you can adopt or incorporate aspects of their approach. Observe subordinates’ work to determine their strengths and developmental needs. Document and prioritize needs. Identify candidates for immediate feedback and coaching.Study Study the principles and techniques of active listening. Study subordinates’ behaviors when giving feedback.

Being able to identify and adjust to external influences on the mission and organization requires a certain degree of flexibility and adaptability. Using a logical and methodical mental process to document the changing environment is useful in making necessary adjustments to a plan and prevents the excessive expenditure of resources and unwanted changes in project or mission timelines. Although a project or task may completely change course, it is important to analyze how to adapt the current plan to fit the circumstances (see table 4-80). Table 4-80. Identifies and adjusts to external influences Strength Indicators Need Indicators Knows unit processes and the purpose of key policies, practices, and procedures. Gathers and analyzes relevant information about the changing situation. Determines the causes, effects, and contributing factors to problems. Considers contingencies and their consequences.

Legend: IMI interactive media instruction 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 5-1 Chapter 5 Program Development 5-1. Efforts to develop leaders yield better results if the focus is on proven methods. Army leadership requires establishing interpersonal relationships based on trust and setting the example for subordinates, peers, and superiors. In leader development surveys, leaders ranked leading a unit, personal examples, and mentoring as the three most effective ways to develop their leadership qualities. Integrating leader development fundamentals into an organization creates a positive, learning climate and builds a mindset that prioritizes development. Experience is a powerful learning tool, although it does not guarantee learning. As the leader development tenets convey, learning requires commitment and purpose. 5-2. Leader development benefits both individuals and the organization. The Army is known for its success in developing leaders rapidly. Many development opportunities occur in organizations, though not always used for their learning value. Without intent or a program for leader development, organizational emphasis on learning follows commander interest and unit climate. Leader development programs leverage opportunities to address individual and organizational goals for development. 5-3. Commanders are responsible for training and leader development in their units and for providing a culture in which learning takes place. They must deliberately plan, prepare, execute, and assess training and development as part of their overall operations. Commanders and leaders must integrate leader development into their organizational training plans. 5-4. Developing Army leaders at all levels, military and civilian, is the best means to ensure the Army adapts to future uncertainties. In this sense, leader development directly relates to Army readiness. Individuals who feel the Army and their leaders are interested in them are motivated to demonstrate greater initiative and to engage fully in leader development. Development programs that integrate professional and personal goals are the most effective. Program content needs to account for the individual’s competence, character, and commitment to develop the attributes and competencies desired of Army leaders. 5-5. Organizational leader development programs must nest in purpose and guidance with the higher organization’s program. Programs should be consistent with Army enterprise concepts, strategy, and guidance on leader development. Programs should provide guidance to subordinate units yet allow freedom to determine practices and schedules most conducive to their missions. Programs up and down an organizational structure need to align to create synergy and unity of effort. A battalion or equivalent-sized leader development program should identify specific processes supporting development. Generating force organizations headed by a colonel or similar ranking DA Civilian are a good target for programs that detail specific processes. A battalion program should anticipate the needs of and execution by its subordinate units. 5-6. Variations in programs occur across echelons depending on the organization type and size. For example, a division has greater latitude in selecting leaders for special assignments than does a battalion due to the wider scope of opportunities and larger number of leaders. A Reserve Component unit has fewer training days to plan and schedule team building events, so there may be a greater role for self-development and mentoring. Detached and dispersed units have fewer organic assets to prepare and conduct special events but may have access to external opportunities, such as a training detachment on a university campus. 5-7. The Army holds commanders accountable for unit leader development by regulation (see AR 350-1). Accountability can be included as part of the organizational inspection program (see AR 1-201). Responsibility for leader development cuts across all leader and staff roles. Some developing leader role and responsibility examples are— z Each leader develops subordinates. z The senior officer, warrant officer, noncommissioned officer, and DA Civilian leaders take ownership for their cohorts’ development in the organization. Chapter 5 5-2 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU z Each leader (and those who aspire to leadership positions) takes responsibility for their own development. Collective Training with a Targeted Developmental Focus While conducting battlefield circulation during one battalion’s platoon EXEVAL events, CSM Sash notices that the battalion incorporated developmental and training objectives into the event as the brigade commander directed. In the TOC, several screens depict how the platoons have been assessed. He notices CSM Undeu reviewing some training reports. CSM Sash: “CSM Undeu how are things progressing here?” CSM Undeu: “Pretty well sergeant major. The platoons are executing at a level higher than we anticipated. The NCOs have told me in conversation that targeting development during training has really helped them improve not only themselves, but their teams as well. We’ll confirm that in the AARs.” CSM Sash: “Including that info in the AARs is critical. How are the 1SGs doing?” CSM Undeu: “They’re running a little ragged from the training timeline but are holding up.” CSM Sash: “How are you incorporating developmental opportunities for your 1SGs during this event? Remember, even though they are not the target for this event, we can still challenge and develop them. The systems they use to track their platoons shouldn’t be different from what they will use in combat. The brigade needs your help in identifying developmental strengths and needs at the 1SG/commander level to ensure that we are seeing ourselves accurately. Find a way to assess your command teams during events like this, otherwise you’ll miss things that are critical to the brigade’s success.” CSM Undeu: “I take your point. I got too focused on the platoons since this event centers on them. I completely missed how observations, assessments, and feedback on the next level up reinforces brigade training and leader development objectives.” CSM Sash: “The focus should be at the platoon-level, and you are doing that well. It is also important to take this opportunity to help the brigade see itself since gaps you might find may extend across the rest of the brigade. It helps the brigade commander and me confirm or deny what we think are individual and collective developmental needs at the company level.” 5-8. The next-higher echelon commander, human resources and operations staff, and senior cohort leaders must clarify development roles and responsibilities. These individuals directly and indirectly affect the efficiency and effectiveness of leader development. Delineating Responsibilities Efficiently implementing leader development programs depends on clearly defining and allocating responsibilities across leaders and staff both in and outside the organization. Develop a matrix to document notes on the roles and responsibilities for developing leaders in the organization. UNIT LEADER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS 5-9. Leader development is a mindset and process, not merely an event, reflected by everything leaders do. An opportunity for development exists in every event, class, assignment, duty position, discussion, physical training formation, briefing, and engagement. Leader development is a continual and purposeful process. It is an ongoing process intended to achieve incremental and progressive results over time. Program Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 5-3 PROGRAM CREATION 5-10. Various types and echelons of commands and organizations label their leader development guidance with different descriptions such as strategy, philosophy, policy, memorandum, plan, or standing procedure. The title and format are less important than having a good plan—one that aligns with the leader development tenets: committed organization; clear purpose; supportive learning culture; enabler of education, training, and experience; and feedback. The plan helps to inspire and guide the organization to engage in development. Programs that incorporate leader development into daily operations without creating extra events are well received and have the greatest chance for effective implementation. Having a plan brings attention to leader development, provides focus and purpose, encourages the mindset, sets conditions, shows how development should occur, and coordinates efforts across the organization. 5-11. Developing a leader development program follows the same steps used in the operations process (see ADP 5-0). Planning involves understanding a situation, envisioning a desired future, and planning effective ways to achieve that future. The program should allow for disciplined initiative by subordinate units and individual leaders. A leader development program is specific because the outcomes need to address both organizational and individual goals as well as short-term and long-term goals.The long-term focus extends beyond a commander’s tour and beyond the member’s time in the unit. Most DA Civilian leaders are not reassigned based on time, though leader development programs like those in operational units often serve their needs. Once the commander’s visualization is described and the program plan is developed, they direct preparing and executing the unit’s leader development program. The commander and unit leaders execute the program and assess its progress. The leader development program creates change in the organization and in individuals—it is a living document. As leaders develop, update the program plan. Understand 5-12. To aid understanding, leader teams can use formal assessments such as command climate surveys, aggregated trends from leader assessments, unit-level assessments (such as Unit 360 or Army Readiness Assessment Program), training center AAR take-home packages, and command inspection program results to focus on conditions indicating unit strengths and developmental needs. Even an analysis of all unit members’ IDPs can provide detail on where to focus or where developmental gaps may exist. The leader team takes these various information sources along with their own observations and discussions with subordinates and colleagues to determine an appropriate focus. Table 5-1 lists external and internal information sources leaders can use to shape and inform an assessment of their organization. Table 5-1. Information sources for assessment considerations External Internal Review the Army Leader Development Strategy, Army Campaign Plan, and command guidance. Meet with personnel who focus on the organization’s well-being such as the higher headquarters’ chaplain, Staff Judge Advocate, Inspector General, other staff, and support agencies. Review higher headquarters’ leader development guidance and programs. Review prior command inspection program results. Mission essential task list assessment. Exercise or deployment results and after action reviews. Operational and training exercise performance records. Upcoming events or training calendars. Organizational climate surveys. Aggregated insights from individual development plans. Unit 360 rollup report. Personnel roster and personnel qualification records. Personal assessment of subordinates’ education and experience. Social media. Tour work areas and facilities. Evaluations and support forms. Initial counseling feedback. Insights from individual development plans (such as common strengths and weaknesses). 5-13. The leader team may not always have existing formal assessments to use. Additionally, the unit mission or composition may change so those sources may no longer apply. In these cases, leaders align goals with their observational assessments and any changes to organizational mission and goals. Chapter 5 5-4 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Scheduling and completing a Unit 360 can inform an organizational developmental baseline. Unit rollup reports provide information on organizational leadership strengths and developmental needs to focus planning and identifying developmental priorities. Assessed leaders receive an individual feedback report highlighting personal leadership strengths and developmental needs to inform their IDP development. During periodic developmental sessions, leaders review subordinate IDPs to gain insight on current developmental priorities and possible program improvements. Finding Developmental Opportunities CSM Baker is conducting the weekly 1SG meeting prior to next week’s battalion’s gated training strategy. The battalion struggles with last-minute maintenance and supply issues which causes a lot of unpredictability for its Soldiers. CSM Baker: “You all were in the training meeting last week. How are you incorporating the leadership attributes and competencies into your overall training objectives?” 1SG Diaz: “Sergeant major, we have been underwater with all the last-minute taskings. It’s all I can do to just meet suspenses right now.” The other 1SGs nod in agreement. CSM Baker: “I get it. It has been chaotic in the HQ as well. I know the last-minute stuff causes unpredictability for the Soldiers and it shows in the way they carry themselves. Even with the chaos of last minute taskings, continue to find ways to fight Soldiers one rank up. Those engagements can be a developmental opportunity for them. This can free up some of our senior leaders to focus on implementing the commander’s guidance. Provide feedback to those you delegate responsibility to.” 1SG Morton: “Acknowledge all sergeant major. We’ll continue to use these opportunities to develop our leaders. I have several corporals and specialists that could handle some of the things I would usually task a sergeant with.” CSM Baker: “That’s right. I will work at the battalion level to protect your time, but you are responsible for using it. Don’t let your commanders plan in a vacuum, be involved and proactive in developing your people. Look for innovative ways to incorporate leader development and communicate with your leaders. Let them know you are deliberately developing them and everything they do is a developmental opportunity— take advantage of it—and grow as a Soldier and leader.” Visualize 5-14. Several sources inform decisions about setting the desired future end states for leader development. Philosophically, the team can examine the Army Campaign Plan and the intent in higher and sister organization’s development programs. The most important and enduring outcomes are stated in a vision or intent statement, depending on the commander’s preference. 5-15. An organizational development program establishes the goals for specific end states. Each leader development program has four mutually supporting purposes. Each organization leader has a designated responsibility to accomplish the mission, improve the organization, prepare personnel to perform current duties, and develop leaders for future responsibilities and other assignments. Different from unit training plans, the leader development program addresses long-term outcomes for individuals and the organization. 5-16. Outcomes should address at least these four areas (see table 5-2). Planning and executing the leader development program is an organizational leader’s responsibility. The vision or intent helps to focus and synchronize leader development actions across the organization to achieve the greatest effects. Table 5-2. Program goals and outcomes Outcomes Individual Organization Short-term Improve personnel capabilities for unit duties Accomplish the mission Long-term Increase personnel capabilities beyond current assignment Improve the organization Program Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 5-5 Leaders who recognize and approach development as a process balance the Army’s long-term needs, their subordinates’ short-term and career needs, and their organizations’ immediate needs to determine how and when to integrate leader development opportunities in daily schedules. Plan 5-17. To start a plan, the leader team goes through a conceptual process to consider how to achieve its desired end state. The end state and enduring purpose help guide the detailed planning phase that involves selecting activities to emphasize in the unit’s program. The most important element of a successful leader development program are leaders with a mindset, clear-cut vision, and passion for developing others, themselves, and teams. They capitalize on every opportunity. 5-18. The activities cover unit and individual development for short-term and long-term development. The following factors provide ways to structure a plan: z Phases of a leader’s cycle within a unit.  Reception.  Integration.  Utilization.  Assignment rotation within the unit.  Transition. z Unit cycles.  Sustainable readiness model.  Deployment schedule.  Green-amber-red time management and training cycles. z Cohort programs.  Sergeant’s time.  Preparation for Soldier and sergeant excellence boards.  NCO professional development.  Warrant officer professional development.  Officer professional development.  Leader team/Command team.  Civilian leader development seminars.  Combined leader development programs. z Developmental focus—common core for the team and all leaders.  Command climate (see AR 600-20).  Mission command principles (see ADP 6-0).  Core leader competencies (see ADP 6-22).  Core leader attributes (see ADP 6-22).  Performance qualities, such as adaptability, resilience, versatility, creativity.  Core unit mission and functions. z Developmental focus—career paths for leader groups.  Career leadership responsibilities (see DA PAM 600-3, DA PAM 600-25, and AR 690-950).  Career Management Field.  Functional area.  DA Civilian Career Programs. Chapter 5 5-6 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Taking Advantage of Developmental Opportunities 1SG Diaz is walking through the motor pool with his platoon sergeants at the end of the week to check the vehicle lines. He often does this to ensure uniformity but also as an informal way to let the platoon sergeants air grievances. Over the last six months he has learned a lot about his platoons and how they operate from their feedback during these informal meetings. 1SG Diaz: “I know that the operating tempo has been high, and we aren’t where we want to be with the platoons moving into collective training. CSM Baker reiterated that the battalion would help protect our calendar, but we need to be able to shift priorities in stride. He already said we can fight one rank up for taskings and that should help free up some leaders.” SFC Jefferies: “That will help a little but that doesn’t solve the issue of the platoons being ready for collective training. They just need more time together, and we don’t have that.” 1SG Diaz: “What if we stopped pulling from across the company for taskings and instead put whole teams on them together? This would give team building time without adding anything to the calendar. CPT Williams is aware of our weaknesses, and she has been incorporating attribute and competency development into our future training events. What the company needs from you is twofold: First, know the developmental AND training objective for each event and ensure your people know them as well. Execute the event to standard and conduct and record the AAR results. Second, identify developmental and training gaps across your platoons so we can address them in future events to improve individual and unit performance.” SFC Addenour: “That makes sense. I can put some of my specialists in charge of taskings and that will help them develop while letting the teams or squads spend more time together. That also lets me get more involved in the planning process with 2LT Hower. She is new to the platoon, and I need to find ways to spend more time assisting and helping her understand the environment.” ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- “Incorporating leader development objectives into mundane taskings is a blessing in disguise. Find innovative ways for teams to share experiences together. Ensure you give feedback to leaders after development events to maximize the impact.” ~ CPT Hower (in initial guidance to subordinate leaders) 5-19. Successful organizations integrate formal, semiformal, and informal activities into their development programs. Policy or regulation direct formal techniques. Addressed in doctrine, semiformal activities are commonly practiced and may be required, but failure to conduct them does not carry punitive consequences. Informal development practices include opportunities with a focus on learning. Table 5-3 on page 5-7 lists ways to enable learning. Setting conditions for development, goal setting, assessments, and advice and counsel all contribute to improved learning. Table 5-4 on page 5-7 provides additional opportunities and developmental activities. Both tables separate various techniques into formal, semiformal, and informal categories.

From considering the learning enablers and developmental opportunities, the leader team creates a plan for scheduling events. The schedule assists those leading and supporting the execution. The schedule maintains reasonable activities and direction of emphasis to help ensure quality. Some events are required, such as performance evaluations and professional growth counseling, and the plan’s emphasis triggers other activities. The plan should encourage a mindset where leaders take the initiative to incorporate development into daily activities. Such activities include raising questions in an AAR about what leaders learned about leadership or asking leaders what self-development they are doing. 5-21. The leader decides the best method to describe the leader development program, such as annual concept, quarterly concept with specific events, or theme based. The plan needs synchronize with the overall unit schedule considering the training calendar, significant higher headquarters’ events that need support, and other significant events. Execute 5-22. Once completed, the leaders distribute the plan throughout the unit to direct program preparation and execution. Depending on the echelon, the leaders review subordinate unit leader development programs. The leader team sets, directs, and leads the organizational goals, shaping the conditions for individual development. Individual development is based on the interests and the effort of individuals who develop others and themselves. It is up to each individual to learn, grow, and develop as an Army professional. An IDP is a personal development plan. It is important that individuals and their raters work together to develop an IDP. Executing the leader development program can become a regularly reported item in reviews, situation reports, and training briefs. 5-23. Leaders must ensure the plan affects development positively. The plan is a way to emphasize development and desired outcomes for individuals and for units. Leaders develop the plan with an intent to see it through. Reviewed, assessed, and updated periodically, the plan is a living document. Leaders commit to creating an open learning environment where development becomes second nature, like when leaders integrate leader development into daily administrative and training events, as well as deployments. Assess 5-24. Good units use various and distinct methods to continually assess leader and leader development strength and weaknesses. The leader team needs to ensure individual development stays the main effort and that the focus does not become the plan or running events. The documented plan is either an enabler or a detractor to successfully executing and achieving the desired outcomes depending on the degree of initiative. 5-25. Leaders assess implementation and execution against the established vision and end states. Just as leadership assessments help set goals for the unit leader development program, assessing the program implementation and execution provides useful information on how well the end states are being achieved and areas for adjustment. The leader team should monitor whether the vision and end states are adequate or need improvement (see Section IV in chapter 2). 5-26. Leaders must conduct required development activities such as performance evaluations, professional growth counseling, IDPs, and command climate surveys. A leader’s assessment in developing others can occur through reviewing how leaders used formal, semi-formal, and informal activities in the program.The leadership requirements model establishes the expectations for these functions and performance evaluations have provided the mechanism for checking. Multi-source assessments provide personal feedback to the leader on what they have done to establish a positive climate, engage in developing others, and steward the profession. The multi-source feedback provides an opportunity for leaders to address and improve their approaches before evaluation. 5-27. Leader development is a holistic process that occurs every day aligning training, education, and experience to prepare leaders to improve. Development is critical to all cohorts—enlisted, officer, and civilian—the Army’s future leaders source. The process balances long-term Army needs, subordinates’ short- term and career needs, and immediate organization needs. Program Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 5-9 TRADITIONAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS 5-28. Choosing the right blend of topics, medium, frequency, and intended audience is based on the commander’s needs for their unit or mission. Some options include— z Professional reading programs. z Professional writing programs. z Staff rides, historical tours, and terrain walks. Professional Reading Programs 5-29. Organizations and individuals can implement professional reading programs; many materials are available to support topic determination, such as the U.S. Army Chief of Staff’s Professional Reading list or the U.S. Army Center of Military History Recommended Professional Reading List. Reading recommendations and book reviews from military journals, online discussion forums, podcasts, and social media provide options for inclusion into unit or personal reading programs. Determining the frequency, such as monthly or quarterly, depends on organizational missions, but the unit must allocate and protect time for effective implementation. Professional reading programs can include a mix of journal articles, professional papers, graphic novels, or military professional blog posts. Mixing sources enables leaders to share new ideas, writing styles, and emerging authors. Successful reading programs depend on how they are structured—what readings are chosen and what purpose is integrated into the program. To encourage tactics, then select readings on operational tactics. To develop skills for which interesting readings do not exist, then design questions that trigger reflection about engaging material. For example, to stimulate critical thinking assign questions about the materials that require applying lessons to other situations and considering underlying assumptions and alternative courses of action. Professional Writing Programs 5-30. Army leaders consider how they can contribute to the body of thought in their fields of expertise by researching and writing about topics that interest them. By writing and publishing papers, they can advance their profession, mastery of their discipline, and writing skills. Scholarly paper writers study their topics in depth and in breadth. They take formal classes in research and in writing so they can master appropriate standards. They use appropriate writing processes. Before submitting papers to professional or academic journals, they ensure their submissions meet the publications’ requirements. In addition, the unit security office should screen items for publication to prevent classified information spillage. Writers scrupulously adhere to intellectual property rights rules and shun plagiarism. 5-31. For leaders, a developmental writing program serves as a significant complementary companion to a professional reading program and may lead to publication in scholarly journals. Length may vary based on the requirement. Some ideas for professional writing include: z Leadership philosophy—an opportunity to discuss expectations, what is important, and what is non-negotiable. z Personal experiences:  Significant experience, whether good or bad, and its personal effect including lessons learned.  Routine experiences, describing how you handle them and possible improvements for consideration. z Historical person or event related to the branch, regimental affiliation, or organization. z Opinion piece explaining changes affecting your branch through a particular person, policy, or equipment. z Book or movie reviews providing a detailed analysis of published or broadcast material for an online or professional journal. Chapter 5 5-10 FM 6-22 1RYHPEHU Considerations for Professional Reading Reading programs foster study by making the reading relevant, providing a purpose, and following up. Leaders can use this suggested format to present on leadership and leader development to others. Book/Article/Reference Leader name and position Describe the leader’s environment and situation. Who was the leader leading? How did the leader attempt to influence the situation or people? What were the positive and negative outcomes? What were the leader’s strengths and developmental needs? What lessons from this leader’s experience can be applied now or later? Additional questions to focus readers on specific aspects: What is the title’s significance? Would you have titled it differently? If yes, what is your title? What were the central themes? Were they adequately explored? Were they presented in a clichéd or unique manner? What did you think of the structure and writing style? What was the most central to the work? What resonated positively or negatively with you personally? Why? Has anything happened to you like the examples cited? How did you react? What surprised you the most? Did the book cover historical, economic, racial, cultural, traditional, gender, sexual, or socioeconomic factors? How did they affect the central idea? Was it realistic? Did any quotes stand out? Why? Was any situation familiar? Are there any works you would compare with this? How do they compare? Did you disagree with the author’s views? If so, what specifically and why? Have you read any other work by the author? Were they comparable to this? What did you learn, take away, or get from this work? Did your opinion change as you read it? How? Would you recommend it to a peer, subordinate, or supervisor? Did the author present anything confusing or contradictory? Why do you think the author included some of the stories? How do you rate the work? How do you feel about reading it? Staff Rides, Battlefield Tours, and Museum Visits 5-32. A staff ride is a historical campaign or battle study that usually includes deep preliminary study, an extensive site visit, and opportunities to dissect and integrate lessons learned throughout the event. A component of this detailed study is a terrain analysis and the terrain’s effect upon the battle or campaign. Seeing the location provides context to leader decisions and insight into the choices leaders made. 5-33. Staff ride handbooks and atlases enable organizations to conduct staff rides, often with assistance from the Army University Press or Center for Military History. Occasionally, units develop their own staff rides and share products with other organizations. Virtual staff rides follow the same methodology as a live staff ride but provide a detailed terrain replication based upon satellite imagery, digital terrain, or three- dimensional models to immerse participants in the virtual terrain and provide a realistic battlefield vision. 5-34. Historical battlefield tours or museum visits can provide opportunities to visualize leadership and historical lessons by interacting with material items or physical terrain, but without the detailed study associated with a staff ride. Battlefield tours are typically brief and may include facilitated instruction from Program Development 1RYHPEHU FM 6-22 5-11 a guide. Guides may provide selected leadership-oriented readings in advance but tend to assume a greater role to compensate for the audience’s lack of detailed preparation. Using carefully prepared questions, posed during or after the tour, the facilitator can still make the tour a critical thought and analysis exercise, drawing on any preliminary readings and perspectives acquired during the event. Battlefield tours use terrain and the historical situation to teach leaders. Museums follow similar concepts as battlefield tours, but provide interactions with material items, artwork, or artifacts to enhance learning and discussion. Museum staff often tailor tours and events to audience needs. See Center for Military History Publication 70-21 for more on staff rides, battlefield tours, and museums. EXAMPLE PROGRAMS 5-35. Figures 5-1 through 5-5 provide examples of battalion-level guidance and programs for units. Figure 5-1 is a sample battalion plan template followed by an example using that template (see figure 5-2 starting on page 5-12.). Program guidance may have annexes for special events or specific cohort programs. Figures 5-3 through 5-5 (see pages 5-14 through 5-20) depict example development programs for battalion NCOs, platoon sergeants, and lieutenants. These example programs illustrate the necessity of developing leaders through daily events and not relying solely on a singular program for development.

Developing a set of formal and informal indicators that accurately assess the health of unit leader development in the organization is essential. Leaders use locally developed indicators to develop a leader development scorecard (see figure 5-6). Indicators may be different for different unit types, such as operational vice institutional. Employing a red/amber/green status suggests indicators requiring further investigation, which may or may not relate directly to unit leader development efforts. The purpose is to identify trends over time and not react adversely to an indicator’s single occurrence. Add locally developed leader development indicators to the unit training brief for subordinate units to track and report on like other key unit systems (such as training, maintenance, or budget). Refine the measures to those that accurately indicate leader development health. Figure 5-6.

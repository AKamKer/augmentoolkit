The Army defines the Public Affairs Program as the guide to conducting public communication strategy for information, command information, leader engagements, and community outreach activities directed toward both the external and internal publics with interest in the Department of Defense. The principal audience for FM 3-61 is all members of the profession of arms. Commanders and staffs of Army headquarters serving as joint task force or multinational headquarters should also refer to applicable joint or multinational doctrine concerning the range of military operations and joint or multinational forces. Trainers and educators throughout the Army will also use this publication. Commanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure that their decisions and actions comply with applicable United States, international, and in some cases host-nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels ensure that their Soldiers operate in accordance with the law of war and the rules of engagement. (See FM 6- 27/MCTP 11-10C.) FM 3-61 uses joint terms where applicable. Selected joint and Army terms and definitions appear in both the glossary and the text. Terms for which FM 3-61 is the proponent publication (the authority) are marked with an asterisk (*) in the glossary. When first defined in the text, terms for which FM 3-61 is the proponent publication are boldfaced and italicized, and the definitions are boldfaced. When first defining other proponent definitions in the text, the term is italicized and the number of the proponent publication follows the definition. Following uses of the term are not italicized. FM 3-61 applies to the Active Army, Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States and United States Army Reserve unless otherwise stated.

It describes the fundamental principles and concepts that provide information to internal and external international and national key actors who have a vest interest and involvement, audiences, and publics. This publication includes public affairs functions, core tasks, tenets, and characteristics for commanders, planners, and other users of Army public affairs. Public affairs professionals use this manual to plan and execute public affairs strategy, planning, operations, and training. This publication is based on current force structure and materiel capabilities. It is authoritative but not prescriptive. Public affairs professionals apply their professional knowledge, skills, and judgement when recommending command transformations to the principles in this publication to meet specific situations. This updated version of FM 3-61 adds discussion of communications strategy within public affairs operations, fully coinciding with the 2020 update of AR 360-1. Revisions were designed with commanders in mind, as the first three chapters are now dedicated to the commander’s public affairs program, responsibilities, and communication synchronization. The merge between public affairs and visual information led to the change to include visual activities and planning. In addition, this version incorporated more inclusivity, in alignment with Department of Defense and joint policy and guidance. FM 3-61 contains 9 chapters: Chapter 1 provides an overview of communication strategy from the commander’s perspective. It first explains commander’s communication strategy, outlines the public affairs mission and explains the public affairs mandate under Title 10, United States Code. Chapter 1 details how public affairs activities, core tasks and tenets, and characteristics support the commander and aid mission accomplishment. Lastly, the chapter describes how a communication strategy is integrated into operations through mission command, the operational framework, synchronization, and visual information. Chapter 2 details methods used by public affairs personnel to advise the commander on the development and execution of an effective communications strategy. The chapter then explains the importance of the commander’s guidance to public affairs in developing the commander’s communication strategy and establishing the priorities for public affairs operations. Next, the chapter stresses the importance of the commander granting timely access to the public affairs officer. Finally, it describes the relevance of time to public affairs operations in achieving the desired effects. Chapter 3 addresses the Army public affairs staff and its organization to support commanders and their communication strategies at all levels of command. It describes the roles and responsibilities of various public affairs personnel, including commissioned officers, noncommissioned officers, Soldiers, and Army Civilians, in providing public affairs support to Army operations. The chapter also details the various public affairs organizations and which echelon they are tailored to support. Chapter 4 examines the relationship between public affairs training and an effective communication strategy. It outlines individual and collective training requirements for public affairs Soldiers and units. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of conducting public affairs training for non-public affairs units and highlights the roles, responsibilities, and methods that public affairs leaders and Soldiers use to provide this training. Chapter 5 describes how public affairs planning is integrated within the operations process. Planning is an activity of command and control and involves effective use of the military decision-making process. Public affairs planning occurs during all activities of the operations process. The public affairs officer is responsible for producing the public affairs estimate, proposed public affairs guidance, and Annex J (Public Affairs). This chapter introduces the commander’s communication synchronization process as a method for Introduction viii FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ coordinating and synchronizing public affairs activities during operations. Information on how Army public affairs develops and implements a crisis communication strategy and the essential components and process of developing a communication plan are also presented in this chapter. Chapter 6 provides information on media facilitation.Public affairs provides the capability to assist civilian news media representatives at home station and in a deployed environment. The objective of media facilitation is to support news media agencies’ efforts in covering operations to tell the Army’s story. Chapter 7 defines the role of public affairs in managing an organization’s communication to various audiences. It examines the concept of segmentation and describes public communication from the perspective of audiences, stakeholders, and key publics. Additionally, this chapter covers basic principles of command information, community engagement, and communication synchronization, while introducing various supporting products. Finally, this chapter concludes with an examination of various regulations, laws, and policies that apply to the conduct of ethical and effective public affairs operations. Chapter 8 describes the role of public affairs in countering misinformation and disinformation. It defines and describes misinformation and disinformation while emphasizing the importance of countering disinformation effects. This chapter explains disinformation tactics and offers methods for identifying misinformation and disinformation. The chapter emphasizes expedient release of information to counter disinformation and deter adversaries. Finally, the chapter outlines tactics for countering misinformation and disinformation in various media, including social media. It also describes the strategic narrative and how public affairs counters the adversarial narrative. Chapter 9 defines the role of public affairs in digital media management and social media presence. It first defines digital media management, as it differs from social media maintenance. Additionally, this chapter covers the components of a digital media management strategy. It concludes with a definition of social media and the requirements for establishing a social media presence. This publication contains seven appendixes. Appendix A details the format and content for public affairs running estimates. Proposed public affairs guidance is discussed in appendix B. Appendix C illustrates and explains the details in Annex J (Public Affairs) to the base order or plan. The communication plan is covered in appendix D. Appendix E gives and overview of media facilitation products. Appendix F details a message map and ways to use it to interact with the media. The final appendix cover public affairs professional development. The introductory table-1 outlines changes to Army terminology reflected in FM 3-61. Introductory table-1.

Commanders play a critical role in the Army communication strategy. The Army must continue to maintain the trust and confidence of the American people while using information to deter competitors and defeat adversaries. Commanders employ their qualified public affairs personnel, staff, and unit personnel through all phases of the operations process to achieve communication objectives. Communication objectives nest with the Army communication plan. Part One explains which parts of public affairs directly relate to commanders and the role that they play in the public affairs process. Part One provides commanders with the Army’s public affairs and visual information structure and organization to give commanders a better understanding of their responsibilities for public affairs and visual information. Chapter 1 Communication Strategy Overview COMMUNICATION STRATEGY 1-1. The commander’s communication strategy, also known as commander’s intent for public affairs, is the communication process and activities for public information, command information, crisis communication, visual information, communication synchronization, and community engagement directed toward external and internal audiences with interest in the Department of Defense (DOD). In public affairs, a public is a segment of the population with common attributes to which a military force can tailor its communication (JP 3-61). By implementing the DOD principles of information, Army public affairs (PA) operations help to establish conditions that lead to trust and confidence in the Army and its readiness to conduct multi-domain operations, deter competitors, and defeat adversaries. Commanders conduct PA operations while deployed and at home station in support of those objectives. To ensure synchronization with Department of the Army (DA) and DOD communication efforts, commanders align and nest PA operations with PA guidance from the Office of the Secretary of the Army as distributed through the Chief of Public Affairs. (See DODD 5122.05 for the DOD principles of information.) COMMUNICATION SYNCHRONIZATION 1-2. Modern technology provides commanders with a greater ability to shape and affect the information environment by implementing their PA and visual information capabilities. The commander’s communication synchronization, formerly known as strategic communications or STRATCOM, helps commanders operate in the information environment. Commander’s communication synchronization is a process to coordinate and synchronize narratives, themes, messages, images, operations, and actions to ensure their integrity and consistency to the lowest tactical level across all relevant communication activities (JP 3-61). Commanders’ communication influence internal and external audiences, as communication links information to decisions and decisions to actions. In public affairs, an audience is a broadly defined group Chapter 1 1-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ that contains stakeholders and/or publics relevant to military operations (JP 3-61). Information imparts structure and shape to military operations for internal and external audiences alike. 1-3. Commanders formulate and communicate their intent to their Soldiers, subordinates, and various audiences to describe the boundaries in which they may exercise initiative while maintaining unity of effort. The qualified public affairs officer (PAO) is the commander’s principal advisor and counselor for public information, command information, crisis communications, visual information, communication synchronization, and community engagement. As a skilled communicator and member of the commander’s personal staff, the PAO remains closely and continuously involved in all operational phases. 1-4. The PAO normally leads the commander’s communication synchronization (CCS) and coordinates themes, messages, narratives, talking points, images, operations, and actions. The PAO implements higher- level communication guidance to the lowest tactical level across all relevant communication activities. The PAO supports the development and execution of the commander’s communication lines of effort and objectives. These communication objectives guide the CCS, and conversely, the CCS ensures that the commander’s communication objectives nest and align with the broader DOD strategic narrative. (See paragraph 1-20 for more on CCS.) PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND THE COMMANDER’S INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT 1-5. JP 3-61 defines public affairs as communication activities with external and internal audiences. PA is a primary capability supporting the commander’s operations in the information environment. Through this capability, the commander provides information to global and domestic audiences in efforts to accurately describe operations or provide information to affected publics in the area of operations. PA provides these audiences with facts explaining why the Army does certain things and conducts specific operations to create a shared understanding and to help those audiences make decisions. Providing credible, accurate, and timely information serves as the best means to counter misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda, which can lead to deterred competitors and defeated adversaries. Maintaining trust, transparency, and credibility is critical when providing public information. Soldiers must never compromise this. 1-6. All information dissemination, regardless of the communicator or medium, is intended to either inform or influence. The intent of the communication guides the commander’s decision to either inform or influence the public to achieve the desired end state. Commanders must use PA with various groups providing accurate information within authorities, laws, regulations, and operations security guidelines. Commanders are required to have a public affairs program that includes communication with internal and external audiences. COMMANDER’S SUPPORT TO THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS MISSION 1-7. Commanders will support their PA teams and staffs when executing the PA mission. The Army PA mission is to fulfill the obligation to keep the American people informed. It helps to establish the conditions maintaining confidence in America’s Army and its readiness to conduct operations across the range of military operations. This obligation is established in Title 10, United States Code (USC). 1-8. Implicit in a democratic republic is the right of citizens to know the activities of their elected government. The government, in return, has an obligation to inform its citizens of its activities. This right also applies to the activities of the military as it is established by the Constitution to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. 1-9. One of the most significant conduits through which information is passed to our citizens is the free press guaranteed by the Constitution. Since the nation’s founding, the Army has communicated information to the American people through the media in both traditional and emergent platforms. 1-10. Commanders use the science of control—which includes information and communication as part of the commander’s command and control system—to conduct operations successfully. When properly employed, PA assists in meeting the commander’s communication intent. PA enables the commander to establish and maintain the trust and confidence between the Army and the American people that is essential to the legitimacy and support of the Army as a profession. All stakeholders are affected—whether negatively Communication Strategy Overview )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 1-3 or positively—by the flow of information. Army PA contributes to ethical behaviors, respect for laws of war, and the rights of noncombatants. PUBLIC AFFAIRS MANDATE 1-11. The Secretary of the Army is required to designate a single career field to conduct PA. Commanders, through their PA operations and the communication strategy, are responsible for informing the American people of the Army’s mission and goals as well as communicating to the public what the Army does. Informing the American people assists the Army in establishing conditions that lead to the public’s understanding and support. Effective PA generates and enables the sustainment of Army credibility with international, national, and local publics, while deterring competitors and defeating adversaries. 1-12. PA is a commander responsibility. PA doctrine and principles of information apply across the range of military operations. At each level of command, PAOs report directly to the commander. Commanders at all levels ensure that PA coordinate and de-conflict planning with other information-related capabilities (IRCs) through command working groups, planning groups, and the CCS. 1-13. Commanders are authorized to designate only DOD-qualified personnel as official spokespersons. Commanders educate and encourage all their Soldiers and DA Civilians to provide timely information appropriate for public release to tell the Army story. By projecting confidence and commitment during engagements and other interactions with families and friends, Army personnel promote public understanding of military operations and activities. (See AR 360-1 for PA spokespersons.) THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS MISSION 1-14. The structure of the public affairs mission visibly resembles the Parthenon. The overarching public affairs mission consists of the activities, the tasks, and the tenets (see figure 1-1 on page 1-4). PA activities are the guiding functions of the PA mission, which directly enable the commander’s efforts to inform and educate audiences in the operational environment. Commanders use PA activities to achieve their communication strategies. 1-15. The tenets form the base of PA mission and represent the best practices or actions by PA staff. The tenets support the core tasks. PA professionals conduct the core tasks in support of the commander’s communication strategy to complete the public affairs mission. Chapter 1 1-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ Figure 1-1. Army public affairs structure PUBLIC AFFAIRS ACTIVITIES 1-16. PA activities support the commander’s communication strategy. There are five PA activities: public information, command information, CCS, community engagement, and visual information. Planning and assessment throughout the course of operations support the activities. With today’s technological advancements, some PA activities may converge or overlap as information becomes instantly available throughout the information environment. Army PA core tasks and tenets—with communication characteristics—support the five activities. Commanders ensure PA professionals have access to manpower, resources, technology, public networks, and professional equipment to facilitate PA activities. 1-17. PA requirements and actions are inherent in all military activities and are key enablers for managing and delivering information through public communication. Army public information dissemination is consistent with security and DOD principles of information. (See JP 3-61 for the formal definition of public information; see paragraph 2-9 and DODD 5122.05 for the principles of information.) Information technology advances provide new public information opportunities. In addition to the deliberate use of these technologies, commanders must include media engagement activities in fully developed communication plans. Media facilitation activities provide information to international and domestic publics. Commanders and their PA staffs should conduct briefings and interviews, issue statements, respond to queries, arrange for access to operational units, maintain digital communication tools and platforms, and provide appropriate equipment, transportation, and communications support to the media. (See paragraph 1-34 for more on media facilitation. See appendix G for media facilitation products.) Command Information 1-18. Command information is communication from the commander to help members of the command understand organizational goals, operations, and significant developments. (See JP 3-61 for a discussion of command information.) Although installation and organizational publications provide traditional ways of Communication Strategy Overview )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 1-5 communicating with the command, other forms of communication—including digital media platforms— provide quicker and more efficient means of communication. PA professionals understand digital media operations and methods to communicate quickly and effectively with local publics, such as using social media in announcing weather hazards, gate closures, or traffic issues. During a military operation, commanders consider all available dissemination capabilities to communicate releasable details and the role of the military in the operation. 1-19. Commander’s intent drives public affairs activities. Command information reflects commander’s intent. Command information is an excellent venue to incorporate and reinforce the five essential characteristics of the Army Profession (trust, military expertise, honorable service, ésprit de corps, and stewardship), the Army Ethics, and the three-certification criteria of Army professionals: competence, character, and commitment. While command information is intended to communicate internally, commanders must recognize that in today’s information environment, once information is released, it becomes readily available to all publics. Commander’s Communication Synchronization 1-20. CCS synchronizes communications and information across all echelons to ensure unity of effort and to reduce and eliminate information fratricide. Failing to synchronize communications across echelons results in conflicting messages, reduces credibility, and directly impacts communication effectiveness. It also allows the adversary to undermine the commander’s credibility and narrative and, ultimately, the broader DOD strategic narrative. CCS stresses the importance of the human dimension and the effect that the commander’s communication objectives have throughout an operational environment. 1-21. CCS is driven by the commander’s operations in an operational environment. During operations, CCS provides operational planners insight on foreign audience perception of the operations. This insight helps build a better understanding that should help guide and synchronize operations with supporting words and images that further the commander’s objectives. As the primary coordinator of public information within the military, PA plays a key role in—and often leads—CCS to maximize alignment of all communication efforts held by other IRCs. CCS is integral in ensuring that the commander’s communication objectives align with the broader DOD strategic narrative. (For more on CCS, see AR 360-1, JP 3-61, and JDN 2-13.) Community Engagement 1-22. Community engagement encompasses all Army community relations activities regardless of name, activity, or sponsorship. This includes community engagements associated with recruiting, Soldier and leader engagement, or any other terms adopted for the purposes of face-to-face interaction with civilian publics (see DODI 5410.19 and JP 3-61 for community engagement). Army community engagement is a PA activity that supports the relationship between military and civilian communities. PA personnel work collaboratively with groups of people affiliated by geographic proximity or a special interest to enhance the understanding of and support for the Army, its operations, and its activities. All community engagement activities should support the commander’s communication objectives. PA assists in identifying key leaders and recommending opportunities for military engagement. Military leaders at echelon have a responsibility to engage key community leaders, including those from other government agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). (See paragraph 7-31 for more on community engagement.) Visual Information 1-23. Visual information is visual media with or without sound and is a visual subset of military information used to support communication synchronization, command information, community engagement, public diplomacy, operational planning, decision making, and training. (See JP 3-61 for a formal definition of visual information.) Visual information (VI) enhances information activities with visual context that supports PA themes and messages.VI comes from two sources: directed sources, such as PA activities and combat camera (COMCAM), and derivative sources including manned, unmanned, and remotely piloted platforms that collect imagery. 1-24. Regardless of the mission and conditions under which VI is created, it becomes an official record and may be releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as a request for evidence in litigation cases, Chapter 1 1-6 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ or under other sources of legal authority. In accordance with the DOD Captioning Style Guide, all producers, editors and users of VI select, label, and retain VI with complete captions and metadata to describe the content accurately. Users can obtain information about, and access to, imagery from or through central DOD VI information systems. Army PA professionals establish and operate such information systems in compliance with DODI 8320.02. One system is CORE, the Army’s official content management system. Central DOD VI information systems provide tools to build a digital presence for organizations and the Defense Visual Information Distribution System (DVIDS), which provides a connection between world media and Service members serving at home. PUBLIC AFFAIRS CORE TASKS 1-25. The Army Universal Task List (known as AUTL) outlines the Army PA core tasks. Core tasks are key activities PA personnel perform to ensure mission success. PA core tasks make the PA section or unit essential for commanders, staffs, media representatives, and publics. The core tasks, as outlined in the Army Universal Task list, are: z Provide advice and counsel to the commander. z Conduct PA and VI planning. z Conduct PA training. z Conduct media facilitation. z Conduct public communication. z Counter misinformation and disinformation. z Conduct communications assessments. Provide Advice and Counsel to the Commander 1-26. The PAO is the commander’s senior advisor on communication strategy and PA activities. The PAO establishes and sustains commander and staff relationships and maintains direct and timely access to the commander. The more the PAO understands the operational environment, the more valuable the advice and counsel and the more developed the communication strategy. 1-27. PAOs ensure commanders understand implications of their decisions as well as the strength of public perception. Commanders understand the implications of their actions and decisions on PA. With the evolution of the global information environment, PA activities have become an increasingly critical element in determining the success of support to strategic end states. Commanders recognize the strength and influence of public opinion and perception on the morale, confidence, and effectiveness of Soldiers’ abilities to achieve mission success. 1-28. PA professionals assist the commander in providing complete, accurate, and timely information to the public while developing the commander’s communication strategy and the plans that achieve that strategy. All information must abide by the constraints of operations security (OPSEC). Providing timely information within such constraints enables the commander to achieve a balanced, fair, and credible information exchange and relationship with the public while deterring competitors and defeating adversaries. 1-29. PA professionals assist the commander in understanding the information needs and expectations of Soldiers, Family members, the home station community, and all other affected publics. Commanders consider these expectations when developing their communication strategies. PA professionals also tailor communication plans to meet the information needs and expectations of the affected publics both foreign and domestic. Conduct Public Affairs and Visual Information Planning 1-30. PA section or unit conducts PA and VI planning. Communication strategy takes continuous, collaborative planning. Developing a synchronized, cohesive, and comprehensive PA and VI plan is vital in meeting the commander’s communication objective requirements. The PA and VI section or unit must articulate and synchronize PA and VI planning within the military decision-making process (MDMP), to include incorporating COMCAM assets where necessary. Commanders incorporate the communication strategy and objectives in the initial plan. The PA section or unit provides detailed analysis of PA activities Communication Strategy Overview )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 1-7 beyond article counts and positive, neutral, and negative evaluations. PA professionals also plan for and incorporate traditional, nontraditional, and digital media platforms into the PA plan, analysis, and assessment. (For more on planning, see the discussion beginning in paragraph 5-1.) Conduct Public Affairs Training 1-31. PA professionals conduct PA training. PA and VI qualification training occurs through the Defense Information School as a joint Service program. PA leaders and Soldiers are trained to follow the operations process of plan, prepare, execute, and assess in unit training and leader development by using unit training management as discussed in ADP 7-0. PA professionals participate in and use the MDMP to plan PA training. (See Appendix H for more of leader and unit development.) 1-32. The training may be group media familiarization, one-on-one interview techniques with subject matter experts, and appropriate use of digital media that can impact the information environment and strategic level actions. Such training applies to all Soldiers within the command. PA professionals must be prepared to train and assist unified action partners. Effective training replicates operational realities and teaches the fundamentals of media and military interactions. Such training emphasizes that the media is a communication channel to internal and external audiences and not an adversary. OPSEC must be a consideration for all PA training. 1-33. Commanders are responsible for establishing a unit public affairs representatives (UPARs) training program in their commands. (Refer to AR 360-1 for UPAR.) Commanders provide Soldiers who have been officially designated and placed on additional duty orders the requisite training in PA. (For more on UPAR training, see paragraph 4-33.) Conduct Media Facilitation 1-34. PA staff conduct media facilitation. Media facilitation involves planning, preparing, executing, and assessing a media engagement. A media engagement is a specified instance of media interaction between a spokesperson and a member or members of the media. Media interactions occur when the media interacts with Soldiers, often on the battlefield, without PA presence. 1-35. The meaning of the word media has evolved from radio, televised, and print mass communication and now includes information technology and social media. PA staff also evolve media facilitation to support digital media platforms needs and increased nontraditional media interest in Army activities. Facilitation must include traditional, nontraditional, and digital media. PA personnel require access to information and operations centers, along with adequate media facilitation facilities, to assist the media in reporting the Army story properly. 1-36. Media facilitation includes the support of embedded media. Media embeds can be included into a command over an extended period. Commanders ensure that media embeds are credentialed and that they are provided a set of ground rules. (For more on media embeds, see discussion beginning in paragraph 6-45.) Conduct Public Communication 1-37. PA professionals conduct public communication in all military activities. Through public communication, PA personnel manage and deliver public information. Public communication is communication through coordinated programs, plans, themes, and messages among the Army and international, national, and local publics, as well as competitors and adversaries. It involves the receipt and exchange of ideas and opinions that contribute to shaping public understanding of, and discourse with, the Army. (See Chapter 7 for a discussion of public communication.) Counter Misinformation and Disinformation 1-38. PA professionals counter misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation is a subset of information that includes all incorrect information. Disinformation is the deliberate use of incorrect or false information with the intention to deceive or mislead. Army PA enables commanders to preempt, identify, and counter adversary attempts at malign narrative. PA distribute legitimate, timely, and truthful Chapter 1 1-8 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ information regarding Army operations, equipment, and personnel across multiple platforms within OPSEC constraints. 1-39. Commanders play a critical and strategic role in countering misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation, disinformation, or a combination of both is not an adversary but a tactic used by adversaries. Adversaries use information as propaganda to minimize the effect of military operations and programs. To combat this use, commanders must understand that the release of timely and accurate information is paramount. While conducting this task along with conducting communication assessments, PA personnel can identify the adversarial narrative. With an identified narrative, the commander can shape the communication objectives to counter the narrative through timely and accurate information. Conduct Communications Assessments 1-40. Commanders and staff conduct communications assessments. Communications assessments follow the general assessments process discussed broadly in ADP 5-0 and in detail in FM 6-0. ADP 5-0 provides overarching guidance on assessment. However, commanders have unique considerations for PA assessment. Proper PA assessments may require additional resources not readily available within the command. Additionally, commanders must examine legal authorities when considering aspects of assessing an operational environment as it relates to use of capabilities not typically available within the PA staff. 1-41. Commanders and staff conduct communications assessments throughout an operation and measure whether the unit achieved communication objectives as planned. These assessments inform the commander’s decision on whether or not to change course. Commanders and staff continuously assess an operational environment and the progress of the commander’s objectives within it. The PAO and other staff representatives monitor the operational environment, which influences the outcome of operations and then provide the commander timely information needed for decisions. Planning for the assessment identifies key aspects of the operation in which the commander is interested in closely monitoring and where the commander wants to make decisions. The assessment identifies and evaluates the information environment relevant to the commander’s intent, mission, area of operations, and echelon of unit. It includes an examination of the physical and social infrastructure from a PA perspective. (For more information on assessments, see paragraph 5-64.) PUBLIC AFFAIRS TENETS 1-42. Effective application of the PA tenets follows the DOD principles of information and can result in more effective and efficient communication activities, improved relationships with the media, successful countering of misinformation and disinformation, deterrence of competitors, and defeat of adversaries. The tenets describe best practices. Successful PA personnel review and appropriately apply these tenets during all stages of PA activities, PA core tasks, and the operations process. (See DODD 5122.05 for the principles of information.) Practice Ethical Conduct 1-43. The practice of PA centers on truth, trust, and credibility. To be effective in a profession that relies heavily on institutional and individual credibility, effective PA professionals require a solid ethical foundation. The Army Profession is built on trust, and PA professionals are charged with establishing conditions that lead to trust and confidence in America’s Army in peace and war. 1-44. Lapses of ethical judgment often become controversial media topics, garner negative publicity, and significantly damage reputations and credibility. As a result, these lapses potentially result in the loss of trust. Adversaries may exploit and magnify any loss of discipline by Soldiers through propaganda and the media. Such negative publicity damages the Army’s reputation; adhering to the tenets of PA can minimize the effects of negative publicity and maintain public trust and confidence in the Army. 1-45. PA professionals communicate to internal and external audiences the importance of careful and responsible management of the Army Profession. These professionals communicate with their actions by adhering to the highest standards of military ethics and morality. This stewardship helps solidify the trust among the American people, host nations, and the Army. Communication Strategy Overview )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 1-9 1-46. To maintain credibility, PA professionals abide by journalistic ethics and can identify when media representatives fail to adhere to fair and balanced reporting. Although PA professionals cannot control the media, PA professionals must be accurate and accountable. They treat all media representatives with respect, integrity, and equal consideration to maintain credibility. Provide Maximum Disclosure, Minimum Delay 1-47. The Army has an obligation to keep its publics informed in a thorough and timely manner. Open and independent reporting is the norm. Commanders grant media representatives access to units, activities, and operations within the bounds of OPSEC. Media representatives are individuals representing civilian radio or television station, newspaper, magazine, periodical, independent blog, or news agency to gather and report on a newsworthy event. Commanders delegate authority to PAOs to release information to the public as stipulated in AR 360-1. PAOs avoid withholding or delaying the release of information solely to protect the installation, command, or the Army from criticism or embarrassment. Being open and forthcoming enhances the Army’s credibility and trustworthiness. Tell the Truth 1-48. PA professionals release only accurate information in a timely manner. The long-term success of a commander’s communication strategy through PA activities depends on maintaining the integrity and credibility of officially released information. Deceiving the public undermines trust in the Army. Accurate, balanced, and credible presentation of information leads to public confidence in the Army and the legitimacy of Army operations. Attempting to deny unfavorable information or failing to acknowledge its existence leads to media speculation, the perception of a cover-up, and the loss of public trust. Commanders, along with their PAOs, should address issues openly and honestly as soon as possible. Provide Timely and Accurate Public Affairs and Visual Information 1-49. Commanders remain prepared to release timely, factual, coordinated, and approved information and imagery. The public release of information and imagery has a powerful effect on friendly, neutral, adversary, and enemy decision-making cycles and perceptions. The source that releases more timely and accurate information and imagery often controls the information environment. As part of the commander’s communication strategy, PAOs establish a timely and accurate process for the release of information. Practice Security at the Source 1-50. All Army personnel must be aware of OPSEC and are responsible for safeguarding sensitive information. Therefore, it is critical that the appropriate PA section approve official information and imagery prior to public release. (Refer to AR 360-1 for public release of information.) Official information is information that is owned by, produced for or by, or is subject to the control of the United States government. OPSEC applies to media interviews and the sharing of information and imagery with families or friends to include email and digital media platforms. Commanders ensure PAOs and PA noncommissioned officers (NCOs) responsible for the release of information are OPSEC level II qualified. (See AR 360-1 for security of information.) Provide Consistent Information at All Levels 1-51. The public often receives information simultaneously from multiple sources. The Army’s and the commander’s credibility are jeopardized if the information conflicts. PAOs need to appropriately coordinate information and imagery and ensure it complies with command guidance before releasing it to the public. The CCS supports consistent information at all levels. Tell the Army Story 1-52. The commander’s communication objectives—through the communication strategy—aim to tell the Army story accurately, honestly, and completely to as many publics as possible. The commander tells the story through a timely release of information to internal and external audiences and digital media platforms. The civilian media serve as a link between the Army and the American public. That link is critical as the Chapter 1 1-10 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ Army cannot carry out its mission without public support. Commanders recognize the legitimate role of news media and digital media platforms in reporting military operations and accept the presence of these platforms wherever the U.S. military operates. COMMUNICATION CHARACTERISTICS 1-53. Communication characteristics are those qualities, behaviors, skills, abilities, and knowledge that directly and positively impact the success of PA and the Army communication strategy. PA leaders measure characteristics objectively and improve PA professionals through mentoring and training. Communication characteristics help PA professionals focus attention on key command goals, improved credibility and public understanding and support. 1-54. PA professionals must— z Exercise a proactive approach to determine second- and third-order effects and develop plans to shape possible outcomes. z Exercise disciplined initiative by adapting to operational conditions through flexible and agile creative thinking to solve problems. z Comprehend the strategic vision by seeing the big picture and strategic implications of tactical events. z Use sound judgement in recommending appropriate communication objectives to the commander. z Create a collaborative understanding of the impact of PA activities on an operational environment, mission, and operations. z Enhance relationships and communication through cultural awareness by understanding the cultural differences among military, U.S., international, competitor, and adversarial publics and knowing how PA activities impact each differently.z Apply ethical reasoning to make informed choices and provide counsel to the commander when faced with tough issues and ethical concerns concerning the ramifications of an organization or leadership’s actions. PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND THE JOINT INFORMATION FUNCTION 1-55. PA operations are conducted, using proper authorities, as an information function. Synchronizing PA operations with military IRCs helps the commander shape the information environment. The information environment is the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information (JP 3-13). The information environment consists of the physical, informational, and cognitive dimensions. 1-56. The complexity of the information environment creates many challenges for commanders. The global expanse of the information environment and technology enables news reports and analyses to inform public opinions and decisions concerning military operations rapidly. Information is constantly being gathered and disseminated as evidenced by the continuous news cycle as well as by digital media platforms with a seemingly unimportant post or update going viral. Geographic boundaries no longer limit information dissemination; therefore, information about an event in the United States can directly affect operations in a theater of operations halfway around the world and vice versa. Misinformation and disinformation can negatively affect U.S. operations and must be considered in the CCS. 1-57. PA professionals analyze information across traditional and digital media platforms to assess effectiveness of Army communication and to identify risks created by misinformation, disinformation, or both. Identifying misinformation and disinformation that places commander objectives at risk is a critical PA task within the information function. Public information about Army activities may have positive or negative effects in the information environment. Technological advances have made collection and dissemination of information available to broader and more diverse publics faster and on a larger scale. The American public, allies, competitors, and adversaries view military operations in real-time, which results in the increased analysis, critique, and editorial commentary by the media and publics. Communication Strategy Overview )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 1-11 PUBLIC AFFAIRS SUPPORT TO MULTI-DOMAIN OPERATIONS 1-58. Information requirements exist across all domains and during all operations. Army PA, as a unique IRC, supports the joint force in multi-domain operations by enabling commanders to identify, target, and respond to near-peer adversaries’ efforts to fracture alliances, partnerships, and resolve. Multi-domain operations assert that near-peer adversaries—in a state of continuous competition with the United States, its allies and partners—seek to weaken resolve by exploiting conditions of an operational environment. An operational environment is a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander (JP 3-0). Within the information environment, modern near-peer adversaries use misinformation and disinformation tactics in both the competition and armed conflict of multi-domain operations, and distribute the resulting false narratives through traditional and digital media platforms. 1-59. Information is the pervasive backdrop to an operational environment and is continuously changing. To help shape a conducive information environment, commanders use PA and design a communication strategy engaging key publics within an operational environment and throughout the competition and armed conflict of multi-domain operations. Army leaders plan, prepare, execute, and assess operations by analyzing an operational environment. Commanders and staff synchronize PA with the operations process. 1-60. In multi-domain operations, PA seeks to counter adversarial misinformation and disinformation by actively conducting and facilitating communication among the Army and international, national, and local publics through coordinated programs, plans, themes, and messages. 1-61. The perception of the Army and its conduct of operations is as important to the success of an operation as decisive action on the battlefield. Through proper planning, integration, synchronization, and coordination, Army units conduct PA operations to help address the five problems the Army confronts in multi-domain operations: compete, penetrate, disintegrate, exploit, and re-compete. 1-62. PA staff, when directed or required, coordinates and often leads using military IRCs and other staff components through CCS in support of multi-domain operations. Effective PA personnel thoroughly understand the essential characteristics of the Army Profession, the fundamentals of Army operations, and the strategic context within which the Army conducts multi-domain operations. PA leaders recognize the links tying public opinion, political decision-making, and the National Defense Strategy together as well as the Army’s application of the multi-domain operations concept to fulfill its role to the Joint Force. PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND INFORMATION OPERATIONS 1-63. PA and information operations (IO) both directly support military objectives, but their activities differ with respect to commander’s intent, scope, and audience and are governed by separate procedures. PA is the principal capability for keeping the American public and Army informed and educated. IO is the integrated employment of IRCs in concert with other lines of operation to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting our own. (See JP 3-13 for more on IO.) 1-64. Commanders, through non-PA information-related activities, communicate to select, non-American publics to change attitudes, beliefs, and behavior. In tactical and operational environments, and when appropriate, staff sections in the IO working group conduct synchronization and coordination of communication objectives. The working group conducts coordination in which PA and command-designated IRCs participate during tactical and operational missions; however, the capabilities retain their own distinct identities and staff organization. 1-65. PA Soldiers participate in the IO working group by continually assessing the information environment to determine the degree and nature of media coverage. They take steps to correct misinformation and propaganda. They also seek to leverage other military IRCs—such as COMCAM or civil affairs operations— to provide greater accuracy, context, and characterization to the information. Additionally, PA operations provide reinforcing messaging for other IRCs. 1-66. The commander designates IRC capabilities in the IO working group to shape an information environment. Mission requirements determine if a staff for each IRC operates independently or with other Chapter 1 1-12 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ IRCs staffs. Based on command guidance and assessments, the coordination through the working group allows for message alignment, reinforcement, and consistency in support of the commander’s overall concept of operations. The commander resolves any differences in courses of actions developed in the IO working group. 1-67. The PA and commander’s designated IRCs establish rapid processes robust enough to quickly understand, shape, engage, and assess information through dynamic engagements of opportunity as well as to make changes to the planned engagements or objectives. Engagements of opportunity could have been identified too late, or not selected for action in time to be included in deliberate engagements. Subjects engaged as part of dynamic engagements are previously unanticipated, unplanned, or newly detected. Examples range from crisis communication to command information response. Units develop a tiered information engagement model that supports deliberate and dynamic engagements through collaborative efforts. Units provide the appropriate authorities to each commander for each activity of an operation or engagement. 1-68. The PA and commander’s designated IRCs establish a process that enables the commander and staff to plan for deliberate engagements based on planned missions and objectives. Deliberate engagements are known events for the unit. Examples range from command information engagements to community engagements. 1-69. The PA and commander synchronize the unit’s IRCs and resources toward engaging the high pay-off engagement list and commander’s priorities in information engagement. The high-payoff engagement list and command response matrix are created during the Army targeting methodology’s decide function. They use this list and matrix during the rest of Army targeting methodology to provide the overall focus and set priorities for information engagement planning. The plan addresses priorities for each activity or critical event of an operation. Engagement selection standards (developed in the command response matrix) address accuracy or other specific criteria that units must meet before engagements can occur. The decisions made are reflected in visual products. The command response matrix, approved by the commander, addresses which, how, and when subjects will be engaged, and the desired effects. (See FM 3-13 for details on Army targeting methodology.) PUBLIC AFFAIRS IN THE OPERATIONS STRUCTURE 1-70. Other IRCs—military information support operations (MISO), civil affairs, military deception operations—may communicate to deliberately influence, persuade, coerce, or spark compliance or thought reform. (See FM 3-53 and JDN 2-13 for more on IRCs.) Commanders who seek to use PA as an influencing instead of an informing capability risk the publics’ perception of participation in propaganda. 1-71. The operations structure—the operations process, combat power, and the operational framework—is the Army’s common construct for unified land operations. PA personnel plan, coordinate, and synchronize activities during CCS as part of the operations process. (See chapter 5 for PA and the operations process.) PA activities help Army leaders communicate their visualization of operations in time, space, purpose, and resources. 1-72. Commanders and staff incorporate PA into every activity of operations. PA planners actively contribute to the operations process and Army design methodology. PA planning begins with the receipt of the mission. PA leads CCS, coordinating with other IRCs in an operational environment during the MDMP. PA provides the following products during CCS: z Media analysis products. z Media engagement plan. z Higher headquarters communication plan. z Incorporated themes and messages from higher headquarters. z Command information plan. z Key leader engagements and outreach activities. z Public communication and digital media plan. 1-73. The result is the development of Annex J (Public Affairs) and the commander’s communication strategy for inclusion into paragraph 3 of the operation order. The PA staff continually assesses the Communication Strategy Overview )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 1-13 information environment to determine the degree and nature of media coverage. (Chapter 5 discusses PA planning. See appendix D for more on Annex J [Public Affairs].) PUBLIC AFFAIRS SUPPORT TO DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES 1-74. PA supports defense support of civil authorities (DSCA) through its PA assessment. DSCA operations are vital aspects of the military’s service to the Nation. DSCA is support provided by Federal forces and assets for domestic emergencies, law enforcement support, and other domestic activities, or from qualifying entities for special events. (See DODD 3025.18 for details on DSCA.) A public affairs assessment is an analysis of the news media and public environments to evaluate the degree of understanding about strategic and operational objectives and military activities and to identify all levels of public support (JP 3-61). PA staff will monitor and assess public opinion, media coverage, and sentiment analysis. 1-75. Critical differences exist between operations conducted in DSCA and operations conducted outside the United States. Differences include the roles of civilian organizations; the relationship of military forces to federal, state, tribal, and local agencies; and the legal authorities under which military forces operate. Military forces train to understand the domestic environment so they can employ appropriate military capabilities efficiently, effectively, and legally. 1-76. State and local officials provide information and directions to the public (such as evacuation and shelter in place) during DSCA. Each state determines who has the authority to provide directions to the public (such as the sheriff, mayor, or judge). In no case does the Army take the initiative to provide directions to the public. Army agencies may assist the appropriate authorities with disseminating information as long as the instructions properly attribute the source. For example, “The mayor has directed a mandatory evacuation for the city” attributes the source of the information to the mayor. 1-77. Army PA personnel coordinate PA activities and comply with PA guidance from the media operations center (MOC) or, if one is not set up, the joint field office. Normally the incident PAO, press officer, public information officer, or MOC releases general information to the public and media. Supporting agencies may assist in the release of information but are limited to providing specific agency actions only. For the Army, this means PA activities are limited to supporting the primary agency or focusing on Army actions that support the incident (in coordination with the primary agency). In no case will Army PA activities place the Army in the forefront; the PAO portrays the Army as a partner and participant in the incident response. 1-78. The PAO ensures Soldiers are aware of the potential consequences associated with questionable on- camera behavior or speaking to the media without authorization. PAOs complete mandatory training posted on the Army Social Media website as required. 1-79. DSCA operations often times create a higher demand signal for VI. These images routinely depict displaced persons and content, which PAOs review before posting. PAOs carefully select and seek legal guidance when considering releasing Army photos during DSCA operations. PUBLIC AFFAIRS SUPPORT TO JOINT, MULTINATIONAL, AND INTERAGENCY OPERATIONS 1-80. Although the Army may operate as an independent element, it normally conducts operations as part of a joint, multinational, or interagency team. The Army regularly works with other military forces (both other Services and unified action partners), non-DOD government agencies, and NGOs. 1-81. The DOD principles of information do not differ in a joint environment from an Army operation. The primary goal still aims to expedite the flow of complete, accurate, and timely information about the activities of joint forces. Joint PA includes planning, media facilitation, execution of internal and external information strategies, and, when appropriate, training and community engagement. Unless delegated to subordinate commanders, the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs is the coordination function for military communication synchronization processes and retains sole release authority of public information concerning all DOD personnel, assets, and operations. (See JP 3-61 for joint PA coordination.) Chapter 1 1-14 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ 1-82. Many radio, television, and internet (including wireless) systems have minimum spectrum requirements. These systems might have access to public networks through commercial means or indirectly through tactical networks. The PA office ensures the systems used by PA teams are mutually compatible with the intended electromagnetic environment. (See DODI 3222.03 for more on this compatibility.) To ensure compatibility, PA personnel conduct a spectrum supportability risk assessment (SSRA) for all spectrum-dependent systems. (See DODI 4650.01 and AR 5-12 for using the electromagnetic spectrum.) PA personnel submit SSRA findings to Headquarters, DA, Chief Information Officer, G-6, Army Spectrum Management Office. Additionally, PA personnel complete and submit a DD Form 1494 (Application for Equipment Frequency Allocation) to begin the equipment certification process, as required for all spectrum- dependent systems, prior to employment within the United States and Possessions or worldwide. (See AR 5-12 regarding DD Form 1494 and SSRA requirements.) )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 2-1 Chapter 2 Advice and Counsel to the Commander COMMANDER’S PRIORITIES AND GUIDANCE 2-1. The commander has a responsibility to ensure the American people and Army personnel remain informed and educated on the operations and activities of the Army. The PAO is the commander’s key advisor on public communication and communication strategy. Commanders should expect competent PA professionals to provide timely and accurate advice and counsel to ensure that the trust and understanding of the American public is not lost. 2-2. As the face of the organization, the commander is the most visible and credible spokesperson for the command, guiding and integrating successful PA operations. The PAO, the commander’s senior advisor on PA activities and communication strategy, is a member of the commander’s personal staff. This officer continuously maintains direct and timely access to the commander and other senior-level staff. 2-3. The commander not only ensures the PAO understands the commander’s intent for PA activities and communication strategy but also establishes the direct relationship between the commander and PAO. The PAO, in turn, has responsibility to stress the importance of communication and a trusted relationship between the commander and PAO. Failure to convey the importance of a trusted relationship between the commander and PAO may hinder the ability of the commander to communicate timely and accurate information, which can develop into crises that facilitate loss of trust and confidence in the commander and the Army. 2-4.The commander conveys priorities and guidance first hand to ensure the PAO has the necessary requirements to begin developing the commander’s communication strategy. Communication plans require command support and involvement. The PAO helps to ensure the commander understands the importance of the commander’s role in communicating to internal and external audiences and at times acting as the spokesperson. 2-5. As the primary spokesperson for the command, the commander relies on advice and counsel from the PAO. When communication opportunities arise, the PAO identifies those opportunities and advises the commander on the proposed approach. The commander may sometimes be the subject matter expert required to speak to the public through the media, digital media, or directly at an event. Preparation is usually necessary to ensure the commander can engage effectively in media interviews, engagements, or a speech to an internal audience. (For more information on commander’s role, see Chapter 4.) TIMELY ACCESS 2-6. The commander has numerous staff and limited time available. Nevertheless, the commander should always grant the PAO immediate access using a set of predetermined criteria. Commanders expect the PAO to engage early, articulate the need for timely access, and identify potential risks. Gaining an understanding and assisting in developing the commander’s critical information requirements, essential elements of friendly information, and friendly force information requirements is a first step in establishing the criteria for timely access to the commander. 2-7. Commanders expect the PAO, as a member of the personal staff, to work in a command structure that includes a deputy commander, chief of staff, and an executive officer. To develop a sound working relationship with the staff, the PAO communicates regularly with these officers. PAOs gain appropriate access to commanders without circumventing the responsibility and authority of this key leadership element. Chapter 2 2-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ INFORMATION RELEASE 2-8. Commanders expect the PAO to advise them on the importance of timely release of public information. The timely release of public information has positive factors as well as negative consequences that may occur when the information appears withheld or delayed unnecessarily. The PAO understands that decisions regarding the timely release of information often depend on the situation. 2-9. The DOD ensures a free flow of news and information to the news media, the American public, the internal audiences of the DOD, and other relevant audiences. The security restraints in DODI 5200.01 and any other applicable statutory and regulatory requirements or exemptions impose limits. DODD 5122.05 explains the DOD principles of information. See figure 2-1 for the DOD principles of information. Figure 2-1. DOD principles of information 2-10. Commanders consider the following regarding releasing timely and accurate public information: z Early release of information sets the pace and tone for solving a problem. It also ensures that PA presents facts accurately from the beginning, rather than attempting to correct the record later. PA professionals ensure they have correct facts, since inaccurate information risks doing more harm than releasing information too slowly. z Uncontrolled release or leaking of information jeopardizes trust and credibility. z Information released as early as possible from the correct source assists with accuracy. z Information released prompts meaningful dialogue and public involvement. z Information released can prevent similar situations elsewhere. z Information released counters or mitigates misinformation and disinformation. z Information released builds public trust and confidence in the command. z Information released prevents perceptions of scandal or cover-up. 2-11. PAOs coordinate the release of information with the proper release authorities. PAOs reference AR 360-1 and pertinent DOD issuances and directives for guidance when preparing to release information. Implementing this guidance ensures information released to the public is done so correctly. )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 3-1 Chapter 3 Public Affairs Staff and Organization STAFF AND PERSONNEL 3-1. PA personnel—including commissioned officers, NCOs, and DA Civilians—stand ready to support the commander with knowledge of communication strategy, the information environment, and potential impacts of PA on operations. Ideally, PA leaders are among the most informed in the command. PAOs must be aware of all aspects of an operation. They prepare to convey information and determine how publics may perceive the releasable information. 3-2. PA staffs at all echelons are small and often require augmentation to conduct PA activities, fulfill PA tasks during training, and complete objectives that are essential to the mission. PA planners assess requirements and plan for and request necessary personnel to provide the commander with the effective capability required. Linguists and cultural advisors often work PA activities and are a required consideration during planning. Knowledge of Army PA personnel, staff, units, organizations, and PA activities is necessary to conduct effective PA operations and communication strategies. PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICERS 3-3. Army PAOs are either commissioned officers of the Army primarily in the rank of major or above, or DA Civilians selected and specifically educated, trained, and experienced as PA professionals. PAOs serve on the commander’s personal staff with primary responsibilities to assess the information environment, advise senior leaders on PA issues, develop the commander’s communication strategy, assist leaders in making well-informed decisions, and translate those decisions into effective PA operations. PAOs develop PA themes and messages for the command that nest with Army messages, plan and execute communication strategies to achieve desired objectives, and evaluate the effectiveness of PA programs. The PAO analyzes the situation, anticipates issues, assesses implications, and develops comprehensive operations to meet the news and informational needs of internal and external audiences. PAOs also facilitate public communication with international and domestic news media. They lead and supervise CCS, public information, engagements, and command information. PAOs oversee PA and VI specialists who create PA and VI products for print, broadcast, and digital media platforms. 3-4. PAOs provide commanders with the expertise and guidance to conduct PA activities through communication strategy and enhance the commander’s ability to acquire, process, and deliver information. Duties of the PAO can include the following: z Maintain the trust of the American public. z Develop the commander’s communication strategy. z Lead CCS. z Communicate to deter competitors and help defeat adversaries. z Develop and execute communication plans. z Advise senior leaders on the implications of unit actions within the information environment. z Provide media training for the unit. z Supervise PA staff. z Communicate news and information to the internal military audience. z Respond to media queries. z Plan and coordinate community events. z Evaluate the effectiveness of the communication strategy. Chapter 3 3-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND COMBAT CAMERA SOLDIERS 3-5. COMCAM NCOs are experts on VI. They supervise, plan, and operate photo, video, and illustration production equipment during operations. The COMCAM junior enlisted Soldier is trained to operate electronic still, video, and audio acquisition equipment to document combat and noncombat Army, joint, and coalition operations. They are trained to operate electronic multimedia imaging equipment and to create illustrations, layouts, posters, graphs, and charts in support of battlefield operations.

NGOs and humanitarian groups, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, American Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations, are often located in geographic areas before, during, and after military operations. They are often present before the media arrive and initial sources of information for journalists. NGOs also may serve as major sources of information during an operation. In many cases, the unit PAO, public affairs detachment, or mobile public affairs detachment may be tasked to support the Civil Affairs Command in the civil-military operations center. Chapter 3 3-10 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ 3-60. Before deploying, PA personnel learn the agencies and organizations in their assigned area. These organizations may conduct short-term humanitarian or long-term developmental operations. Sponsoring groups or agencies can include private corporations, foundations, professional associations, or religious groups. PA personnel must understand the agencies and organizations’ goals, establish an understanding of their potential PA needs, and understand the legal parameters of cooperation with NGOs. NGO representatives may have valuable local knowledge to assist PA activities. PUBLIC AFFAIRS UNITS 3-61. Army PA units augment ASCC, corps, division, and brigade as well as special forces groups (Airborne), and other organic PA staffs to provide PA capabilities. 3-62. PA units are designated as standard requirements code (SRC) 45 units. They require administrative and life support functions from the commands to which they are assigned or attached. These units may support any of the following centers: joint information centers, MOCs, press information centers, allied press information centers, or coalition press and information centers as the situation and mission dictate. SRC 45 units may be attached or directed to support partner nations during multinational operations, exercises, and training. 3-63. Most SRC 45 units are in the United States Army Reserve and Army National Guard. These units integrate with Regular Army units to meet the commanders’ requirements through the deliberate planning process and various operation and contingency plans. 3-64. Because of their modular design, SRC 45 units often provide Army support to other Services, such as a Marine expeditionary force, a joint special operations task force, or an air expeditionary wing. These units routinely support interagency requirements of national importance, such as DSCA. 3-65. There are four types of PA SRC 45 units: z Public affairs detachments. z Mobile public affairs detachments. z Broadcast operations detachments. z Theater public affairs support element. PUBLIC AFFAIRS DETACHMENT 3-66. During deployment a public affairs detachment (PAD) supports the PAO of the augmented unit at a brigade or higher.

The commander may task and deploy the TPASE in teams according to the mission and gaining command PA augmentation requirements. COMBAT CAMERA 3-78. A COMCAM company is a force enabler composed of highly trained VI professionals prepared to deploy to the most austere environments at a moment’s notice. Skilled in acquiring and using still and motion imagery, COMCAM teams attached to a BCT, divisions, corps, or theater army provide commanders with directed imagery capability. This capability supports operational planning, PA, IO, operations assessment as well as forensic, legal, intelligence, and other requirements during crises, contingencies, and exercises around the globe. Mission 3-79. COMCAM forces perform unique and highly specialized missions with digital and analog VI documentation capabilities. They support armed forces in war, natural disasters, and training activities. Structure and Capabilities 3-80. COMCAM companies are commanded by a field grade officer trained on VI management. COMCAM consists of a company headquarters, a tactical operations section, an airborne support section, and three support platoons. Army COMCAM companies provide command, control, and supervision of the operations and activities of assigned COMCAM platoons. They also serve as liaison to supported units, a joint Chapter 3 3-14 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ COMCAM team, and other Service COMCAM elements. COMCAM companies acquire still and video imagery of land, static airborne, and air assault operations and provide presentation and exploitation of visual imagery in support of operational requirements. COMCAM companies establish, operate, and maintain COMCAM facilities required to support theater-level and subordinate tactical command post headquarters. These companies have the training and equipment to operate in all weather and lighting conditions with conventional and special operations units. They maintain airborne qualified Soldiers and conduct other advanced tactical training that may include air assault, combat lifesaver, and advanced marksmanship techniques, enabling them to operate with airborne forces and SOF in areas inaccessible to media or other VI personnel. )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 4-1 PART TWO Public Affairs Operations Part two of this publication covers and discusses public affairs operations. Commanders expect public affairs leaders, Soldiers, and civilians to conduct public affairs operations. Public affairs operations encompass all the collective and individual tasks of public affairs organizations and personnel. Effective public affairs personnel understand the information discussed in this part of the publication. Part two is intended to assist public affairs personnel in executing their tasks. It is not intended to provide instructions on how to perform those tasks. Readers can find instructions on how to perform the tasks and procedures involved at the Central Army Registry (CAR) website. Chapter 4 Public Affairs Training 4-1. Providing PA training to non-PA units is a U.S. Army public affairs core task. PA provides commanders with trained units, leaders, and individuals in support of the mission. PA Soldiers and civilians begin their training when they take their oath and enter Army service. Proper PA training enables commanders, staffs, and Army leaders to recognize, understand, and plan for the strategic, operational, and tactical impact of communications in the information environment. 4-2. Operational success depends on commanders ensuring forces receive well planned, standardized, realistic, rigorous, and performance-based training. Training requires adaptation and flexibility to ensure forces are prepared to engage adversaries using emerging and ever-changing strategies, tactics, and technology. All command echelons focus PA training on integrating PA equities into planning during the MDMP, and taking the necessary steps to synchronize and coordinate communications with other IRCs. 4-3. PA leaders train Soldiers for the range of military operations. These include low-intensity conflicts with violent extremist organizations as well as multi-domain operations designed to deter and defeat near- peer aggression in both competition and conflict. All training ensures PA personnel are ready to deploy, fight, and win. PA training follows the operations process. Commanders and PA leaders assess unit training and leader development through unit training management systems. (See Appendix H and FM 7-0 for detailed information regarding Army training.) 4-4. The presence of media representatives in the Army’s operational theaters is a fact. Media interaction is more a question of when as opposed to if it happens. Conducting interviews is an important part of the PA mission and a part of public communication. Soldiers, leaders, DA Civilians, and Family members are the Army’s best spokespersons. They must be prepared to interact with civilian reporters, in some cases, without direct assistance from PA personnel. Conducting media interaction training with non-PA personnel helps tell the Army story. 4-5. PA planners identify non-PA assets that could assist in executing the commander’s communication strategy. Non-PA assets can directly impact communication throughout an operation and must be taken into consideration while developing training. PA conducts media engagement training for non-PA personnel to Chapter 4 4-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ ensure effective communication and support to the commander’s information objectives. Media engagement is deliberate engagement with the media by public affairs or a unit command team. Media engagement will always involve PA presence. Organizations, units, and individuals may require media engagement training depending on the requirements of the commander’s communication strategy. PA staff conducting the training reference the approved communication plan for information necessary to facilitate media engagement training such as tactics, messages, and talking points. 4-6. Effective PA sections and units conduct challenging training to prepare commanders and spokespersons to communicate the Army message. PA professionals conduct PA training ranging from familiarization training in an auditorium to focused one-on-one interview rehearsals with subject matter experts as well as general training of allies and unified action partners. 4-7. PA professionals help prepare commanders and leaders for public speaking engagements. Commanders, often through their PAOs, maintain a continuous dialogue with media representatives covering military activities. Most media representatives strive to publish accurate, truthful, balanced stories. They aim to report fairly and not to undermine, interfere, or misrepresent the military, its operations, or activities. The PAO has no editorial control over media representatives.Commanders must understand that some media representatives do not always tell the story the commander wants them to tell. Because of this, some stories may result in misunderstandings, errors, or criticisms. In these cases, commanders and PAOs may seek to push back against inaccurate news reports, but balance this against an understanding of the impact of command actions on perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs of the media. The commander formulates and delivers timely and culturally attuned messages to counter potential misperceptions. Successful media engagements start with planning and training. MEDIA FAMILIARIZATION TRAINING 4-8. The Army has recognized the importance of non-PA Soldiers, DA Civilians, and Family members interacting with the media. PA Soldiers have an individual task to conduct media interaction training for non- PA personnel. PA Soldiers train commanders, non-PA Soldiers, DA Civilians, and Family members on properly conducting a media interview and on understanding performance measures used to measure success. TRAINING AUDIENCE 4-9. PA professionals provide training on interaction with the media. First, they identify the training audience. When planning the training, the instructor identifies the audience. After identifying the audience, instructors seek to understand it. Understanding includes identifying the audience’s level of experience and mission. An instructor might seek answers to the following questions to prepare tailored training for the group: z Is the audience a unit? Has it deployed recently? z What media training has audience received at this point? z Is the audience solely junior enlisted, NCOs, officers, or is it a diverse group? z What is the primary mission and deployment destination of the audience? TRAINING METHOD 4-10. Following identification and understanding of the training audience, the instructor selects the training method. Selecting the training method facilitates providing effective media interaction training. Instructors consider training objectives, location, time allotted, number of participants, training materials, and training resources such as number of instructors and evaluators. Instructors have several ways to conduct media interaction training with non-PA personnel. They consider creative new methods, opportunities, and technology. See table 4-1 for possible methods that increase in difficulty in skill. Public Affairs Training )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 4-3 Table 4-1. Methods of training Method Example Purpose Media training briefings A slide presentation normally conducted in a garrison or off-site training facility. Explains the role of public affairs, available public affairs support, nature and needs of the media, and guidance for spokespersons. Mock interviews Information, demonstration, and coaching with a facilitated mock media interview. Provides realistic and mission-relevant interview questions using media role players. Demonstrates the difficulty of an interview, identifies the trainee’s strengths and weaknesses, and teaches how to improve where needed. Records interview training session (on camera, print, or livestream) so trainees can see from a third-person perspective how they performed. Facilitates feedback for the entire training group. Media on the battlefield training Field training exercises in which media role players interact with Soldiers during operations. Supports the principle of train as we fight by providing of the most realistic training environment possible. Affords the commander an opportunity to view their Soldiers’ ability to communicate with the media and assess their capability under stressful conditions. Troop cards Wallet-sized, laminated cards printed using standard computer-based publication design programs. Dispersed during media training events. Gives Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians, and Family members a portable tool to reference before a media interaction. Provides command messages, talking points, media interview tips, common questions and answer suggestions, and public affairs points of contact information. TRAINING STRATEGY 4-11. Selecting the training strategy is necessary and determines the amount, type, and pace of training required for the training audience or individual. A training strategy may be to conduct the training using either the crawl, walk, run method or a combination method. 4-12. The crawl, walk, run method works best when commanders allotted two weeks or months for training before the exercise or deployment. The crawl level can consist of a media training briefing. The walk level might consist of mock interviews. The run level might consist of media on the battlefield training. This method provides levels of training, builds on acquired skills, incorporates evaluation time, and identifies additional training requirements. The training increases in complexity and resource requirements as the trainee develops capability. While the crawl, walk, run training strategy can often result in a higher level of proficiency, it leaves less time for additional training if evaluator has noted any deficiencies. In some cases, combining various training events into one period may be a necessity when time or days between training events are not practical. TRAINING DEVELOPMENT 4-13. Each training method requires different information, skills, and references. Instructors and trainers carefully research, plan, and develop a program of instruction or training tasks using the latest approved policy, doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures. PA professionals conducting media interaction training can reference PA individual and collective tasks located on the Central Army Registry website. PA personnel ensure the training audience receives the latest PA guidance, policies, and procedures regarding media interaction. This equips the training audience with the most current themes, messages, narratives, and talking points. Chapter 4 4-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ 4-14. Some important topics to cover in the PA training include the following: z Role of Army PA and the PAO. z Responsibilities, types, and characteristics of the media. z Tactics, techniques, and procedures to communicate with the media. z PA guidance, policy, and OPSEC to prepare for interview. z Use of relevant messages, talking points, and effective responses to conduct the interview. z Communication through social media networks. Regardless of the training method, instructors and trainers ensure the audience hears and understands the covered training. Instructors and trainers remove distractions and discourage cross conversation so trainees can hear the briefings. They facilitate audience practice of the material covered. Practice allows for immediate reflection and feedback, on the spot improvements, and assessment of time required. CONDUCTING TRAINING 4-15. Instructors and trainers properly develop, prepare, and resource training tailored to the training audience. The training then better provides increased capability for Army PA to tell the Army story to international and national publics. 4-16. PA trainers answer questions, provide examples, and demonstrate what right looks like. Knowledge of references and resources supports the credibility of the training professional. PA professionals require patience and must remember that many personnel in any given training audience may have never received any media interaction training or had any experience speaking in public. This knowledge requires the trainer not just to instruct, but also to coach, mentor, and encourage. 4-17. Training events always require feedback upon completion. PA trainers seek improvement through queries from the audience and leaders receiving the training. Questions regarding relevance, clarity, and presentation method of topics, examples, and exercises are important to answer. Assessment of the training event helps ensure proper use and planning of time at training events. Training performed too quickly or that runs unnecessarily long can demotivate a training audience or diminish the effectiveness of the training. Instructors and trainers evaluate feedback to determine what portions to keep, to refine, to add, or to eliminate. TRAINING SPOKESPERSONS 4-18. Media interaction training often consists of preparing a specific spokesperson to address the media or conduct an interview with a news media representative. The spokesperson requires personal media training and attention to be prepared to deliver the most accurate and timely information to the public. An Army spokesperson represents the Army, their unit or organization, profession, and even the United States. PA staff carefully plan and consider the preparation of spokespersons to ensure the information provided on the record is correct, lawful, and represents Army Values. The task of preparing a spokesperson may come with very short notice or as part of a communication plan. Once determined it is appropriate to conduct an interview, a commander needs to identify an appropriate spokesperson. 4-19. PA staff facilitates and supports the spokesperson and media interaction. The PA staff do not interfere with the media interaction. A media interaction is the Army’s chance to tell the story accurately and effectively. Support to the spokesperson begins with the initial query and ends with assessment and evaluation of the media interaction. PA leaders provide positive support to the spokesperson, even when an event occurs that interrupts the process. Both the PAO and spokesperson remain calm and in control. Expect the spokesperson to have some anxiety regarding the media interaction. Through proper planning and preparation, the media interaction can achieve communication objectives and inform key publics. SELECTING A SPOKESPERSON 4-20. Speaking to the public through the media requires commanders to select representatives who are best suited for the role of a spokesperson and trainer for preparing a spokesperson. Commanders are spokespersons for their command, but other individuals may be required to speak on various topics or areas of expertise. The commander, staff, and PA leader work together to determine the right person to be a Public Affairs Training )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 4-5 spokesperson. PA leaders are the most informed regarding requirements for successful media interactions and the spokesperson. 4-21. PA leaders ensure that individuals selected have the necessary training, skills, and experience to prepare spokespersons ranging from Army Family members to the most senior officers, NCOs, and civilians employees. Consideration of existing professional relationships, appropriate rank, interview subject matter, and abilities are some factors necessary to determine the right spokesperson. 4-22. Spokespersons sometimes need to have in-depth knowledge of a particular topic, which requires identification of a subject matter expert (SME) in the command. Public perspective may lead to the appropriate spokesperson being someone who either is actively involved in the issue or has studied it at length. See table 4-2 for selecting a SME once PA personnel identify the focus of the engagement. Table 4-2. Spokesperson selection Focus Type Information Spokesperson Strategic focus Issues that require a big-picture focus on a topic. Commanders or senior officials who can discuss the issue at that level. Technical or tactical focus Issues that require a more narrow focus on a topic. People closest to the topic, such as the ones doing the actual work and have the resident expertise on the topic. Human interest Any great news or feature story has human interest and emotion at its core. The men and women in uniform and their families. 4-23. PA professionals help determine the narrowed focus, potential SME candidates, and an understanding of the SME topics. Then they help commanders identify the most effective spokesperson for the media interview or engagement. The following characteristics may help identify the best SME: z Has the appropriate level of knowledge regarding the topic. z Understands overall objectives and commander’s communication strategy. z Possesses the ability to tell the story within context. z Holds confidence of leadership. z Desires to do the interview. z Is an effective presenter. 4-24. Effective preparation of a spokesperson requires a PA professional’s respectful candor and expertise, especially during assessing and evaluating the spokesperson’s strengths and weaknesses through the training and preparation session. Failure to identify a spokesperson’s deficiencies during a personal training and preparation session may lead to substandard performance by that spokesperson during a real-world media engagement. A poorly advised spokesperson could compromise the credibility of the Army and the individuals involved. 4-25. Effective crisis communication always requires a competent spokesperson trained and ready when a crisis happens. Because of this, commanders designate the command spokesperson well before any sort of crisis develops. SPOKESPERSON PREPARATION 4-26. Preparing a command spokesperson for a successful media engagement requires several steps. The PAO determines the experience level of the selected spokesperson to determine the needed preparation. 4-27. PA leaders present relevant information, cover necessary details regarding the media interaction, and answer questions or concerns the spokesperson may have. A PA leader can use a message map as a guide for discussion. (See Appendix G for message maps.) A message map helps leverage key messages and talking points while tying in facts, stories, and context. PA personnel explain answer why a recommended effective response to a question is most effective and appropriate. See table 4-3 on page 4-6 for considerations PA personnel apply during spokesperson preparation. Chapter 4 4-6 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ Table 4-3. Considerations for spokesperson preparation Consideration Reason Identify communication objectives to accomplish with interview The commander desires to communicate to key audiences and send key themes and messages through the media. Think of this in terms of the information desired in an article resulting from the interview. Understanding the communication objectives helps the spokesperson craft and articulate appropriate responses during an interview. Provide information regarding the news outlet and the news media representative to the spokesperson Providing baseline information helps the spokesperson break the ice during initial meeting. A news organization synopsis, the reporter’s professional biography, and the reporter’s recent news pieces usually suffice. This information also helps the spokesperson to anticipate possible questions that the media representative will ask. Supplying this information at least one day prior to the preparation session gives the spokesperson more time to synthesize it. Review the media kit The spokesperson needs knowledge of and copies of materials that the media representative received. A media kit provides the reporter information and facts about the unit, relevant topics, and spokesperson, all of which the spokesperson should expect questions on during the actual interview. (See paragraph 6-9 for more on media kits.) Provide approved talking points and messages to the spokesperson The spokesperson requires effective responses and response techniques to answer anticipated questions using approved messages and talking points. The spokesperson must fully understand the talking points and messages. Review the Do’s and Don’ts during an interview The spokesperson reviews security, accuracy, policy, and propriety topics to help provide the necessary response without compromising operations security, misinforming, speculating, violating established policies, or speaking on inappropriate matters. Complete a message map Commanders and their designated spokespeople use message mapping to help connect with audiences on key topics. These maps use a variety of approved, relevant, command-focused messages. Ensure the spokesperson understands the ground rules The spokesperson understands the ground rules that clarify the left and right limits of the media representative or media organization during the interview or engagement. The spokesperson recognizes and reacts accordingly when the media or the media representative violates any ground rules. The PAO present during the interview normally interjects on behalf of the spokesperson to keep the interview on course. Provide spokesperson an opportunity to rehearse Rehearsal helps the spokesperson gain a higher level of confidence. Rehearsal can reveal unforeseen problems and issues regardless of the topic, type of media engagement, and spokesperson’s experience. A technique such as role-playing effectively provides rehearsals that help identify issues, mispronunciations, body language, eye contact, and technical difficulties to correct before the media interaction. Provide feedback to the spokesperson. The feedback should be in the form of an after action review. Pre-interview and post-interview feedback is essential in assessing the effectiveness of the training and the spokesperson’s performance. This feedback should be candid and professional. 4-28. Appendix F contains various media training product templates for use in unit media training. Appendix G contains message mapping techniques and media facilitation guidelines for preparing command spokespeople or SMEs for media engagements. MEDIA ENGAGEMENT TRAINING 4-29. Effective media engagement training encompasses the entire media engagement process of planning, preparation, and evaluation. The training facilitates the commander and PA staff in identifying any actual and potential issues before an actual engagement occurs. Public Affairs Training )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 4-7 4-30. PA staffs ensure spokespersons are equipped well before media engagements with proper training and pre-interview preparation. Expecting a spokesperson to execute a media interview well with little or no preparation is unreasonable. See table 4-4 for factors to consider for media engagement training. Table 4-4. Considerations for media engagement training Factor Reason Date, time, and location Plan training well in advance of any expected media engagement. Conduct the pre-interview in the exact or similar location where the interview will occur. This ensures the environment is suitable for the engagement and gives the spokesperson time to get accustomed to the surroundings. Media interview type Tailor media engagements for print media, television or film interviews, live television interviews (livestreaming interviews), or radio interviews. Anticipate and plan for large media engagements to include a combination of interview types. Preparation Gather facts, review public affairs guidance, collect background information, and develop a media kit with key information related to the interview subject matter.SOCIAL MEDIA TRAINING 4-31. The use of social media has its inherent risks; therefore, it is important for commanders to understand these risks as well as the power and benefits associated with using social media platforms. Effective social media training reinforces a climate where members of the Army including Soldiers, DA Civilians, contractors, and family members understand that online misconduct is inconsistent with Army Values. This training emphasizes preventing, reporting, and addressing online-related incidents at the lowest possible level. Social media training is one tactic to mitigate the risks of social media use. 4-32. PA guidance, policies, and training resources for social media training occurs in all three training domains. PA professionals and unit leaders can reference the Army Social Media website (https://www.army.mil/socialmedia/) for information regarding policies and guidance regarding the proper use of social media as well as education and training resources. It also provides content on social media best practices and up to date trends. UNIT PUBLIC AFFAIRS REPRESENTATIVE TRAINING 4-33. UPARs represent their units for PA functions. UPAR duty provides additional developmental opportunities and training to motivated individuals desiring to tell the story of their unit, organization, and the Army. UPAR selection and training increases the higher echelon PA leader’s capability to communicate for the commander. UPAR products are subject to normal editing and PA release procedures. UPARs must receive training outlining their required PA duties and responsibilities. 4-34. UPARs gain and develop basic PA skills through traditional training methods and may gain additional skills from working with PA professionals in their units and organizations. The course prepares enlisted Soldiers and officers with the training required to serve as a UPAR. At a minimum, UPARs receive training on the following: z The official release authority. z Basic news writing (5W’s and How). z Basic photography. z Media facilitation:  Monitoring and facilitating media embeds.  Coordinating media engagements through a higher echelon PA office. This page intentionally left blank. )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 5-1 Chapter 5 Public Affairs Planning PUBLIC AFFAIRS PLANNING IN THE OPERATIONS PROCESS 5-1. PA planners focus on communication-related activities that occur in the information environment. Planning is a major activity of command and control. PA is involved in planning, providing critical input with G-2, MISO, and IO offices, to ensure mutual support and consideration that may be provided to the commander’s critical information requirements (CCIRs) for the commander’s approval. Small PA sections, such as the brigade, require planning support by the higher headquarters or public affairs unit augmentation. PA staffs are actively integrated in each step of the operations process. 5-2. PA leaders must understand that while planning may start as an iteration of the operations process, it continues upon completion of the initial order and as leaders revise the plan based on changing circumstances. PA staffs remain involved in planning from the beginning. This includes participation in the targeting process.PA leaders and staff must observe the broad spectrum of PA connections. PA terrain is extensive and should be involved in planning. 5-3. PA operations require continuous and collaborative planning. PA planning is followed by the preparing, executing, and assessing activities. Developing a synchronized, cohesive, and comprehensive PA plan is vital in implementing the commander’s communication strategy. The communication synchronization approach fulfills adaptive planning and execution requirements and describes how the commander and staff will coordinate and synchronize themes, messages, images, operations, and actions to the lowest level to support joint force commander objectives. (See JDN 2-13.) PA planners articulate and synchronize the plan throughout the MDMP. The PA plan provides a detailed overview of PA activities and associated support requirements from across the staff and subordinate units. PA planners incorporate VI capabilities, including COMCAM, during planning activities. See JP 3-61 for more information on VI. 5-4. PA leaders employ a mix of three methodologies for planning: z Troop leading procedures. z Army design methodology. z Military decision-making process. See discussions of planning and the operations process in ADP 5-0. PRINCIPLES OF THE OPERATIONS PROCESS 5-5. PA professionals must understand the principles of the operations process: z Drive the operations process. z Build and maintain situational understanding. z Apply critical and creative thinking. COMMANDER DRIVEN 5-6. Commanders drive the operations process through understanding, visualizing, describing, directing, leading, and assessing operations. The commander’s visualization is the mental process of developing situational understanding, determining a desired end state, and envisioning an operational approach by which the force will achieve that end state (ADP 6-0). Chapter 5 5-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ 5-7. Communication of the commander’s visualization across the staff facilitates shared understanding and purpose and aids course of action development during planning. Commanders express their visualization through the following: z Commander’s intent. z Commander’s planning guidance. z CCIRs. z Essential elements of friendly information. 5-8. PA leaders must understand the commander’s intent. Chapter 2 explains that the PA leader must have unfettered and timely access to the commander. It is through this access that Soldiers gain the commander’s intent directly from the commander. By receiving and fully understanding the commander’s intent, PA staffs can develop PA courses of action and take appropriate initiative when unforeseen opportunities arise. 5-9. The commander’s planning guidance broadly describes when, where, and how the commander intends to employ combat power to accomplish the mission within the higher commander’s intent. PA leaders and staffs use this planning guidance to develop flexible and effective options. PA leaders and staffs must also provide concise and accurate input to the commander to help modify plans throughout the planning process. 5-10. Identification of CCIRs focus information collection on the relevant information required to make critical decisions throughout the conduct of operations. The two components of CCIRs are friendly force information requirements and priority intelligence requirements. PA leaders play a critical role in identifying CCIRs in the information environment. PA leaders play a critical role in identifying CCIRs in the information environment, as they are trained to recognize OPSEC. PA leaders continuously assess information environments for elements that pertain to CCIRs. The PA staff submit CCIRs to the commander during the staff planning process. When approved, the commander dedicates assets to collecting the information. PA CCIRs should identify and support assessments on items in the information environment that will directly aid the commanders’ understanding of the impact of tactical and operational activities on the mission objectives. CCIRs can include physical activities of friends, allies, or opposition forces as well as social media activities or opposition activities to influence publics against the commander’s desired outcomes. 5-11. Essential elements of friendly information identify those elements of friendly force information that, if compromised, can jeopardize mission success. PA planning incorporates constant awareness of essential elements of friendly information in conjunction with communication planning throughout the execution of the commander’s communication strategy. SITUATIONAL UNDERSTANDING 5-12. Situational understanding is the product of applying analysis and judgment to relevant information to determine the relationships among the operational and mission variables to facilitate decision making. Throughout the operations process, PA staffs share their understanding of their particular situation and provide feedback to the higher headquarters. Several tools assist PA leaders in building situational understanding and creating a shared understanding across the command and force: z Operational and mission variables. z Running estimates. z Intelligence. z Collaboration. z Liaison. CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING 5-13. PA planners apply critical and creative thinking throughout the operations process. This process assists in situational understanding, decision making, and directing action. Critical thinking helps PA leaders identify causes of problems, arrive at justifiable conclusions, and make good judgements. Creative thinking involves creating something new or original. Creative thinking leads to new insights, perspectives, approaches, and new ways of understanding problems and conceiving ways to solve them. (See ATP 5-0.1 for creative thinking tools and techniques.) Public Affairs Planning )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 5-3 MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS 5-14. PA participates in all steps of the MDMP. PA planners work with the staff during mission analysis to help commanders understand the situation and develop their commander’s visualization. During steps 3 and 5 of the MDMP, the PA staff provides recommendations to support the commander in selecting a course of action. After the commander makes a decision, the staff prepares the operation plan or order that reflects the commander’s intent, coordinating all necessary details. 5-15. The PA staff contributes products and input throughout the MDMP. Unit and organizational planning standard operating procedures (SOPs) dictate specific requirements, templates, and products. Generally, PA planners prepare the following products as part of the MDMP and staff briefing: z Appendix 1 (Public Affairs Running Estimate) to Annex J (Public Affairs) of the operation order. z Commander’s communication strategy. z PA input into mission analysis. z Proposed PA guidance. z Proposed themes, messages, narratives, and talking points. z Information environment assessment. z Communication plan. z PA input to paragraph 3 of the operation order. z Annex J (Public Affairs) of the operation order. 5-16. The MDMP consists of a series of steps that have various inputs, a method (step) to conduct, and outputs, that lead to an increased understanding of the situation and facilitate the next step. Planners generally perform these steps sequentially; however, they may revisit several steps as they learn more about the situation before producing the plan or order. ADP 5-0 provides a detailed explanation and diagram of the seven MDMP steps, key inputs, and key outputs. 5-17. PA leaders and staffs must articulate and synchronize PA planning within the MDMP. Commanders do not develop separate communication plans. Instead, commanders develop plans with communication built in from the beginning. STEP 1: RECEIPT OF MISSION 5-18. During the receipt of mission step of the MDMP, PA planners seek to ascertain higher headquarters PA guidance, determine the commander’s intent, gather necessary tools and information required to advance planning, and begin to organize initial information to foster effective planning coordination and collaboration across the staff. Public Affairs Key Inputs 5-19. Key PA planning inputs during this step include higher headquarters orders, PA guidance, and directed PA posture (if applicable). PA planners should also accumulate and make frequent reference to Army and joint PA doctrine, unit planning SOPs, and any other existing information relevant to the mission. Such information can include existing information environment or media assessments. Public Affairs Key Outputs 5-20. Key PA outputs for step 1 of the MDMP include development of the initial PA running estimate and the proposed commander’s communication strategy. (See paragraph 5-26 for the commander’s communication strategy in step 2 of the MDMP.) Public Affairs Running Estimate 5-21. The PA running estimate is a planning product that captures factors capable of impacting the mission. PA staff use it to comprehensively capture and present section-specific information to the commander and staff with limited time available. As a continuously evolving tool and product, the PA running estimate can differ in form and information depending on the step of the MDMP in which it is being used. Chapter 5 5-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ 5-22. PA planners develop an initial PA running estimate early in the MDMP. As soon as possible after the receipt of a mission or guidance from a higher headquarters, PA planners seek out specifics. They determine the facts, assumptions, and constraints that may affect possible courses of action (COAs). They also help to determine any essential, specified, or implied tasks in step 2 of the MDMP specific to PA delivered in the higher headquarters orders or guidance. 5-23. PA running estimates build on initial running estimates as planning continues or once an operation commences or develops. As PA planners receive more information during mission analysis and subsequent steps of the MDMP, they incorporate it into their running estimate. PA running estimates continuously capture and present both PA-related information and planning factors as well as outline proposed PA actions capable of supporting the commander’s intent. 5-24. As planning finalizes and operations commence, PA running estimates evolve. These estimates include a PA assessment intended to provide the commander and staff with an overall snapshot of the information environment. PA running estimates also include proposed and ongoing PA actions and their intended or observed effect on an overall operational area. 5-25. PA running estimates and assessments take many different forms, but present much of the same information. Unit planning SOPs should locally formalize expectations and requirements for planning products and their associated submission timelines. (See Appendix B for PA running estimate templates.) Commander’s Communication Strategy 5-26. The commander’s communication strategy is essentially the commander’s intent for PA. Initially PA staff develop the commander’s communication strategy during the receipt of mission and mission analysis steps of the MDMP. These planners brief the strategy for approval during the mission analysis briefing. STEP 2: MISSION ANALYSIS 5-27. During the mission analysis step of the MDMP, PA planners continue to receive and analyze higher headquarters orders and updated PA guidance. Information is organized within the PA running estimate and is capable of being shared across the staff to facilitate planning. Public Affairs Key Inputs 5-28. Key PA planning inputs during this step continue to include higher headquarters orders and PA guidance. The mission analysis step of the MDMP tends to yield a large amount of new information about the operational area, environment, and enemy. PA planners should seek out existing information environment assessments or those assessments being updated at higher headquarters echelons or within parallel staff sections (such as intelligence and IO). PA planners work with other staff sections to both ascertain and provide available information of value for respective planning initiatives. Public Affairs Key Outputs 5-29. Key PA outputs include an updated PA running estimate and the proposed commander’s intent and commander’s communication strategy. Additionally, PA planners develop recommended themes, messages, narratives, and talking points supporting the commander’s communication strategy. PA staff present proposed outputs for approval at the mission analysis briefing. STEP 3: COA DEVELOPMENT 5-30. During COA development, PA planners work with the staff to help develop proposed COAs capable of meeting the commander’s intent. As different COAs begin to emerge, PA planners determine how to align and employ PA assets and capabilities within a specific COA to best support the commander’s communication strategy. 5-31. Throughout COA development, the commander and staff depend upon the PA planner to help answer: z What are the PA assets and capabilities available or needed to support this COA? z How should available PA assets be used to support accomplishment of this COA’s key tasks? Public Affairs Planning )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 5-5 z What is the proposed task-organization and associated support requirements? z What are the risks to the commander’s communication strategy associated with this COA? z What opportunities present themselves within the proposed COA? Public Affairs Key Inputs 5-32. Key PA planning inputs during this step include PA running estimates and updated information environment assessments. Public Affairs Key Outputs 5-33. Key PA outputs include a proposed concept of PA support capable of supporting the COAs that the staff and commander consider as well as an updated PA running estimate. Proposed concepts of support for PA often identify associated tasks to units and staff to support PA actions proposed in COAs. Staff need to identify and highlight these proposed tasks as early as possible in both the PA running estimate and orders to avoid surprising the staff and subordinate units. 5-34. The concept of PA support identifies how PA assets will align and operate to support the commander’s communication strategy in a proposed COA. Typically, PA staff present COAs on a single page slide or document. The staff includes important and relevant information such as— z PA assets available and their proposed task organization. z Locations of PA assets, identified media, and key communications nodes and infrastructure. z Key tasks supporting the commander’s communication strategy. z Identified communications risks or opportunities. 5-35. Concepts of PA support focus around a common operational picture (COP) with those of other staff sections. Frequently a map diagram contains important graphic control measures. COPs provide a single display of relevant information within a commander’s area of interest and are based on common data and information shared by more than one commander.PA assets and augmentation must be annotated and incorporated into the unit COP for commander awareness and planning. Retasking is then required to support new mission sets. 5-36. Formats and methods vary regarding the presentation of proposed concepts of support for PA. Unit planning SOPs should locally formalize content, format, submission timelines, and briefing requirements for PA planning products. No single format is required when presenting proposed concepts, refer to higher headquarters PA units for a template. STEP 4: COA ANALYSIS 5-37. During COA analysis, PA planners participate in war gaming and other analysis aimed at identifying difficulties or coordination problems associated with various proposed COAs and what effect they may have on the overall operation. In identifying and considering the possible effects of a proposed commander’s communication strategy within a specific COA, PA planners seek out all available sources of information and historical assessment. 5-38. Throughout step 4’s COA analysis, the commander and staff depend upon the PA planner to help answer: z How will identified key publics perceive the COA’s proposed actions? z How will critical or adversarial media spin the results of the COA’s proposed actions? z What overall impact will the COA’s proposed actions have on the information environment? z What opportunities could emerge as a result of the proposed COA? z What are the residual risks associated with the proposed COA? Chapter 5 5-6 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ Public Affairs Key Inputs 5-39. Key PA planning inputs during this step include the proposed concept of PA support for all COAs being considered as well as an updated PA running estimate. During COA analysis PA planners gather and analyze as much information about the current information environment as possible, to include on-ground media elements and target audience in the operational area. Public Affairs Key Outputs 5-40. Key PA outputs include refined concept of PA support that reflect and incorporate what was learned during war gaming and analysis. PA planners also leave COA analysis with criteria they will use to assess the effectiveness of the commander’s communication strategy. The last output PA planners have is an updated PA running estimate. STEP 5: COA COMPARISON 5-41. During COA comparison, PA planners work with the staff to evaluate proposed COAs independently of each other and against set evaluation criteria approved by the commander. Step 5 aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of proposed COAs, weight them accordingly, and recommend a sole COA most likely to accomplish the commander’s intent. 5-42. Throughout the COA comparison, the commander and staff depend upon the PA planner to help answer: z Which proposed COA best facilitates the commander’s communication strategy? z What are the assessment criteria used to measure the effectiveness of the commander’s communication strategy? Public Affairs Key Inputs 5-43. Key PA planning inputs during this step include a refined concept of PA support for each COA under consideration. Another input for step 5 is an updated PA running estimate. Lastly, PA planners clearly define assessment criteria for each COA’s ability to facilitate the commander’s communication strategy. Public Affairs Key Outputs 5-44. Key PA outputs for COA comparison include a recommended concept of PA support that aligns with the staff’s recommended COA. Additionally, PA planners produce an updated PA running estimate focusing on the recommended COA and its associated concept of PA support. STEP 6: COA APPROVAL 5-45. At the COA approval step of the MDMP, the commander reviews the staff’s evaluations of proposed COAs, the proposed COA, and ultimately selects and approves a COA. During this step, PA planners advise the commander of the proposed the concept of PA support in each COA and their methods of assessing each COA’s ability to facilitate the commander’s communication strategy. 5-46. Throughout this step, the commander and staff depend upon the PA planner to help answer the following: z What are the advantages and disadvantages of each COA at implementing the commander’s communication strategy? z Which proposed COA best facilitates the commander’s communication strategy? z What is the proposed concept of PA support for the recommended COA? Public Affairs Key Inputs 5-47. Key PA planning inputs during this step include refined concepts of PA support for each COA under consideration as well as an updated PA running estimate. The PA planner stands prepared to present in detail the concept of PA support associated with the staff’s recommended COA to the commander. Public Affairs Planning )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 5-7 Public Affairs Key Outputs 5-48. Key PA outputs following COA approval include the approved concept of PA support that aligns with the commander’s selected COA. An updated PA running estimate is produced capturing information intended as Appendix 1 (Public Affairs Running Estimate) to Annex J (Public Affairs) in the upcoming operation order. Lastly, the PA key outputs include a refined commander’s communication strategy. STEP 7: ORDERS PRODUCTION, DISSEMINATION, AND TRANSITION 5-49. During the final step of the MDMP, the staff prepares the order reflecting and directing implementation of the commander’s selected COA. During this step, PA planners write the plan for implementing the concept of PA support aligned with the selected COA, ensuring inputs are included in the base operation order. Unit PAO ensures vertical and horizontal PAO coordination and sharing with higher, lower, left, and right of supporting and supported PA units. Often, this is done outside the operations process. Public Affairs Key Inputs 5-50. Key PA planning inputs during this step include the approved concept of PA support and an updated PA running estimate. Public Affairs Key Outputs 5-51. Primary PA outputs include Annex J (Public Affairs) and both associated appendices. Unit planning SOPs dictate required PA appendices, either Appendix 1, Public Affairs Running Estimate, or Appendix 2, Public Affairs Guidance. Frequent inclusions to these appendixes are public affairs guidance (PAG); proposed public affairs guidance (PPAG); themes, messages, narratives, and talking points; and individual Soldier media cards intended for large-scale reproduction and distribution. 5-52. PA planners also develop a detailed communication strategy assessment. Annex J (Public Affairs) and the operation order without the annex do not require the communication strategy assessment. However, if input from staff sections or subordinate units is required to conduct an accurate assessment, PA planners must voice these requirements during orders production. Assessment plans include both measures of performance and measures of effectiveness relating to implementation of the commander’s communication strategy. COORDINATION AND SYNCHRONIZATION 5-53. The PAO is the primary coordinator of public information and often has responsibility to lead synchronization efforts with IRCs. Throughout planning, staffs meet and conduct mission analysis, develop or update running estimates, provide input to the planning process, and develop respective sections of the operation plan or order. PA planning requires coordination and synchronization of public information and events. PA staff integrate public communication into operational planning while coordinating and synchronizing communication efforts with other IRCs such as IO, MISO, and civil affairs as part of the IO working group. PA and IO have effects that overlap in the IO working group, which require coordination and synchronization with IRCs. Lines of effort relationships always require coordination and synchronization during planning and execution. 5-54. PA staff remain aware of communication implications during operations. Communication occurs with actions, words, and images while Soldiers execute an operation. During planning and execution, PA personnel consider the impact that actions, words, and images have on stakeholders. PA personnel also identify and plan for legal and operational risks. PA staff endeavor to ensure information and communication is consistent and credible. 5-55. PA staff coordinates with logistics and communications staff to ensure resources are available for PA support during operations. PA staff include coordination and support requirements between PA activities at higher and lower level headquarters in planning. This staff considers the necessary support requirements throughout the organization, including those without organic PA assets. PA and VI coordination and synchronization during the planning process helps to identify VI requirements. (Reference JP 3-61 for more information on VI.) Chapter 5 5-8 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ 5-56. Coordination of PA tasks with staff sections and subordinate units is essential. PA personnel coordinate directly when possible. Proper coordination de-conflicts staff efforts and identifies the PA force requirements for the operation. A properly coordinated plan provides the commander and staff a comprehensive understanding of how PA supports operations. THE ARMY COMMUNICATION SYNCHRONIZATION PROCESS 5-57. The Army communication synchronization is a process to coordinate and synchronize narratives, themes, messages, images, operations, and actions to ensure their integrity and consistency to the lowest tactical level across all relevant communication activities. PAOs conduct and normally lead the Army communication synchronization process. PAOs can adapt this process to meet the needs and systems of the Army while maintaining the inherently joint and interagency capability of CCS. Major organizations may dedicate military PAOs to assist their leaders by preparing talking points to align with key messages (JDN 2-13). Plan 5-58. During planning, the PAO accounts for guidance from higher headquarters including the OCPA’s current planning guidance. In support of the joint planning process or the MDMP, the PAO localizes themes and messages and ensures PA operations nest in the commander’s intent. As needed, the PAO integrates these themes and messages with the unit targeting cycle to synchronize with nonlethal effects and IRCs. 5-59. The PAO integrates PA tasks with unit missions. Because units often establish battle rhythm and other recurring events at echelon, the PAO actively integrates PA tasks with higher headquarters PA, community engagement, and information synchronization as necessary. Common events include regularly scheduled PA meetings at the division and corps levels. PAOs often integrate installation PA events with events at other echelons, but events may be separate. 5-60. The PAO oversees a UPAR program in accordance with AR 360-1 and establishes procedures to synchronize the UPAR’s efforts with the commander’s intent. The PAO develops specific synchronization procedures. Prepare 5-61. During preparation, the PAO develops command information products, conducts rehearsals for PA operations, prepares SMEs to speak with the media, and otherwise conducts those activities that enable successful PA operations. Common rehearsals include media facilitations, media interviews, and other types of PA training that enables personnel in the unit to speak with members of the media and the American public. Common communication synchronization requirements during planning include vetting command information with SMEs, informing and refining media engagement plans with higher headquarters PA staffs and commands, and coordinating with members of the media and public for administrative and scheduling requirements. 5-62. The PAO continues to coordinate IRCs with key staff members to synchronize themes, messages, narratives, and talking points throughout the preparation. In a joint environment, the PAO also participates in multi-Service coordination. In some situations, other government agencies may have authority over information-related operations. Recognizing that authorities differ based on areas of operations and intended audiences, the PAO actively seeks and includes representatives whose participation aids the communication synchronization process. Execute 5-63. During execution of a plan, the PAO provides current assessments across echelons to assist in synchronizing and deconflicting IRCs (FM 6-0 and FM 3-90-2). Recognizing that public narratives are not directly controllable, the PAO seeks to constantly refine themes and messages to ensure they stay relevant and effective in shaping narratives and keeping identified publics informed. The PAO additionally identifies emergent misinformation and disinformation to synchronize other IRCs and to develop awareness of how this information affects current narratives. (See Appendix A for countering misinformation and disinformation.) The PAO may recommend addressing misinformation or disinformation via counter- Public Affairs Planning )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 5-9 messaging. Release authority is a necessary and critical component to the capability to address misinformation and disinformation responsibly and rapidly. Unambiguous release authority is a necessary and critical component to the capability to address misinformation and disinformation responsibly and rapidly. Assess 5-64. Assessments are an ongoing process. Commanders use assessment to integrate relevant, reliable feedback into planning and execution, thus supporting their decision making regarding plan development, adaptation, and refinement, as well as adjustment of operations during execution. Assessment provides information about the current state of an operational environment, the progress of an operation, and recommendations to mitigate or overcome discrepancies between actual and predicted progress. It also reveals how specific capabilities, such as IRCs, contribute to this progress. (See JP 5-0 for details on assessment.) 5-65. In support of communication synchronization, the PAO uses public relations research tactics, techniques, and procedures to inform key staff members. Common examples of assessments in the communication synchronization process are media content analysis, digital communication and social media metrics, key performance indicators, and estimation of the total exposure of identified publics to command messaging. Ultimately, PAOs seek to confirm or deny that identified publics have been successfully informed and have retained command messaging. When shared, these metrics assist PA staffs at multiple levels of command. ARMY COMMUNICATION SYNCHRONIZATION FUNCTIONS 5-66. Specific communication synchronization events differ by echelon. PAOs adapt to whichever systems and processes staffs implement at their respective units. However, Army communication synchronization events fit broadly in two categories: integrating functions and coordinating functions. Integrating Functions 5-67. Integrating functions, such as commander communication synchronization working groups, are activities that grant approval for planning, or seeking to modify, guidance already approved based on new information or intent. PAOs propose themes, messages, narratives, and talking points, for command guidance and approval. PAOs additionally update the chain of command on the progress of current PA objectives. During integrating functions, PAOs seek to gain or confirm command approval in the same manner commanders seek approval for training calendars. 5-68. Generally, PAOs lead communication-focused integrating functions and serve as participants, supporters, or principal briefers on other integrated functions. Common integrating functions are XO or chief of staff briefings, decision briefings, training meetings, and battle update briefings. Coordinating Functions 5-69. Coordinating functions are those activities that Soldiers use to develop and coordinate activities to achieve objectives. As with integrating functions, PAOs often lead communication-focused coordinating functions. For example, a PAO may lead an operational planning team in support of an upcoming major media facilitation, or may coordinate with PA staffs at different installations and commands to ensure command information is accurate. Coordinating functions also serve the important purpose of synchronizing PA staffs across echelons. 5-70. PAOs execute coordinating functions after the commander has approved communication objectives, or before the commander has approved communication objectives in a pre-decisional capacity. For example, a PAO may coordinate with other staff sections while developing COAs to ensure the COAs are feasible, suitable, distinguishable, acceptable, and complete. 5-71. Common coordinating events can reoccur regularly or just one time. Regularly scheduled events can include UPAR meetings, monthly BCT or division PA meetings, staff synchronization meetings, and email Chapter 5 5-10 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ reports. One-time events can include content operational planning teams, direct coordination with SMEs, conference calls with geographically separated members of PA staffs, and installation or corps PA meetings. COMMUNICATION PLANNING 5-72. Communication planning is a systematic process to develop and deliver intended messages that target audiences receive and understand. It involves selecting the audience and determining an appropriate channel to reach the audience. Communication planning is driven by the commander’s focus on achieving communication objectives. Communication planning is continuous and occurs not only during deployed operations but also during training events and at home station. These objectives assist by giving focus and direction to those developing strategies and tactics, provide guidance and motivation to those implementing the program, and spell out criteria for monitoring progress and assessing impact. 5-73. Communication planning uses a four-step process—research, planning, implementation, and evaluation—commonly referred to as RPIE. The PA planner examines a problem or issue and analyzes available and necessary resources to execute the plan in support of the commander’s communication objective. Through research, the PA planner thoroughly examines the nuances behind a particular problem or issue, identifies affected publics and stakeholders, and accounts for the time required to complete the plan in time for effective implementation.Communication planning that minimizes data collection and analysis may result in lackluster receipt or delivery of intended messages. During the assessment and evaluation of the communication plan’s execution, planners ensure receipt and delivery meet the intent. Implementation of the plan is execution of the operations in the communications plan, or, as opportunities arise to enact the commander’s communication strategy. 5-74. The PA staff assists the commander in communicating information and messages about the force and operations to internal and external audiences. The commander expresses communication objectives in terms of desired effects. PA staffs develop communication plans that result in clearly specified, meaningful communication objectives that support the commander’s communication strategy and contribute to mission success. 5-75. During planning, PA planners further define communication objectives. They clarify execution of the commander’s communication strategy supported by PA core tasks to achieve those objectives. PA staff receive, collect, analyze, and interpret data; identify and analyze publics; and develop tailored messaging designed for effective communication. 5-76. This planning process is ongoing and requires the PA staff to evaluate continually the effectiveness of the communication plan and overall communication efforts. Evaluation involves quantitative and qualitative analysis of the information environment and effectiveness of the execution of the plans and PA operations. 5-77. Communication planning is also necessary in times of crisis. Successful commanders anticipate and plan for crises ahead of time. PAOs assist in this planning. They advise the commander on issues, crises, or emergency communication as part of PAO responsibilities. 5-78. Communication planning results in a communication plan. See Appendix E for detailed guidance on communication plan. PA staff design a communication plan within the bounds of legal authority. The plan aims to impact the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of specific audiences. Commanders can use a communication plan to— z Raise morale, build understanding, dispel rumors, affect attitudes, or change behavior. Commanders may want to encourage publics to think, act, or feel a certain way (for example to stop smoking). This encouragement can involve appealing to feelings, self-interest, or a person’s imagination. z Prevent behaviors detrimental to the force such as intoxicated driving, abuse, or harassment. In instances such as these, PAOs develop communications focused on reinforcing the positive characteristics of a values-based organization. z Prevent misunderstandings. Even a small misunderstanding can create large problems for an organization. PAOs can ensure good communication by putting themselves in the publics’ position, paying attention to their needs, and getting to know them. Public Affairs Planning )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 5-11 z Protect the higher command from misinformation, disinformation, and adversarial propaganda. z Present a point of view. Often, PAOs only need to do this to influence a behavior. CRISIS COMMUNICATION 5-79. In the event of a crisis, PA staff ensures a communication plan exists to mitigate the problem. For PA, a crisis is an event that that affects an organization’s long-term sustainability and reputation. It has the potential to create significantly negative media coverage. An issue is an internal or external factor with potential, at times seriously, to damage an organizations reputation if not managed well. Issues often gradually build and can become crises if not properly mitigated. A crisis communication strategy aims to establish and maintain the commander’s credibility while dealing with the crisis responsibly, compassionately, transparently, and as swiftly as possible. An effective communication plan during crises will not always guarantee a positive outcome. However, communicating during crises is absolutely essential for the commander to attain the best achievable outcome. A crisis is not an opportunity to message. CRISIS MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES 5-80. Effective crisis management involves crisis communication. Crises can happen, and issues can develop while deployed or at home station. PA staffs must be prepared to act accordingly. Every member of the PA staff understands and implements the eleven principles of crisis management. These staff members develop an understanding of the role that PA has in managing crises. Anticipate Possible Crises within the Command 5-81. A staff also war-games potential crises. When at home station, PA staffs identify the possible internal and external agencies involved in a crisis. The staffs rehearse all statements for the media as well as internal and external audiences. Such war-gaming is essential for crisis preparation. 5-82. PA staffs should identify the most likely crises both within the command and external in accordance with the commander’s communication synchronization. Staff should prepare battle drills and responses from the PA perspective to support the commander’s overall goals. Building a relationship before a crisis occurs facilitates solving the problem more easily. PA staffs work with key publics and third-party allies by building ongoing relationships, such as off-post neighbors, elected officials, business leaders, and community emergency response crews. Before a crisis occurs, PA staffs also may educate key stakeholders on potential issues to mitigate the effects of that crisis. These stakeholders might include external agencies such as FEMA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as local and regional contacts from the police, hospitals, or county. Be Part of the Internal Response Task Force 5-83. As part of crisis management, PAOs prepare and rehearse SOPs within the internal task force. As part of this force, PAOs establish a crisis action team. The internal response force is a cross-functional team that advises the command in immediate response to an event or crisis. This team ensures coordination and synchronization of communication capabilities among all sections involved, to include the commander and relevant section leaders. PAOs also write SOPs to ensure timeliness and accuracy of any necessary actions. PAOs gather information only from highly reliable sources to get and give key facts. Efficient PAOs coordinate with the necessary offices and provide as many facts as possible, as early as possible, as long as necessary. They avoid conjecturing or using unconfirmed reports. PAOs base their reports and briefings solely on facts. Know Target Publics 5-84. As part of crisis management, PAOs know their target publics. When a crisis arises, these are often the key communication stakeholders PAOs need inform quickly and to the fullest extent possible. PAOs identify these groups and individuals well before a crisis. Part of crisis anticipation involves knowing how to reach these groups and individuals. PAOS identify and record such information while developing the crisis-focused communication plan. Additionally, PAOs include knowing their internal audience during a crisis. They Chapter 5 5-12 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ answer the relevant question: What do Soldiers, their Families, and stakeholders connected to the affected organization need to know during both issue reveal and once the issue becomes a crisis? Identify the Central Spokesperson 5-85. PAOs identify the central spokesperson before a crisis occurs. A crisis requires a spokesperson who is at or near the appropriate level of command, or is the most knowledgeable (such as the SME). The public and audience often want to hear from the commander. Ideally, the commander responsible for the organization handling the crisis is articulate and receives specific media training to handle high-pressure situations. PAOs ensure whomever speaks for the organization fully understands the commander’s intent themes, messages, narratives, and talking points, outlined in the approved PAG or the PPAG. Work with Media 5-86. During crisis management, PAOs work with media and encourage them to cooperate. As a crisis develops, media attention can cause a situation to significantly impact the organization or command more than anticipated. During a crisis, PA staff remain open and accessible to the media. The media often requests information about an ongoing crisis or situation. To prevent the media or other stakeholders from developing their own narrative in the absence of facts, PAOs apply the DOD principles of information. PAOs ensure they deliver accurate information approved for release frequently and as often as possible. (See DODD 5122.05 for the DOD principles of information.) Maintain Appearance and Tone 5-87. PAOs maintain their physical appearance and the tone they convey. Information needs of key publics change as a crisis unfolds. When PAOs understand the audience, or key publics, they better package that releasable information to ensure they deliver the right message. Depending on the situation, PAOs and command spokespeople consider applying the following tactics, tones, or messaging when delivering information: z Practice sympathy, empathy, care, and concern. z Commit to doing everything possible for those affected by a crisis. z Investigate to determine the cause. z Desire to avoid any other, or further, damage. z Desire to ensure publics that the Army is doing everything possible to prevent a reoccurrence. z Determine what the commander can do to avoid similar situations in the future. z Establish hotlines for concerned citizens. z Make information available or post it on digital media platforms at regular intervals. Mind the Emotions and Intellect Pendulum as a Crisis Unfolds 5-88. During crisis management, PAOs address the emotions and swinging intellect as a crisis unfolds. PAOs recognize there is a time for cold, scientific facts and circumstances where publics will not hear these facts. Generally, groups of professionals can discuss issues. However, audiences in public hearings or in demonstrations tend to give in to emotions and away from facts. A commander who addresses a crisis as soon as it begins to develop often has a greater opportunity to win with intellectual arguments; that commander has more alternatives for action during the crisis. Command the Information 5-89. The ninth crisis management principle is command the information. Sometimes a crisis unfold in unexpected ways. PAOs stay ahead of the story by maintaining follow-on press releases, statements, and ensuring responders or support network officials are available for escorted media interviews. Commanding the information involves being perceived as having nothing to hide. PAOs avoid giving publics a reason to Public Affairs Planning )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 5-13 speculate on causes or disclosing specifics that may be part of an administrative, criminal, or safety investigation. Additionally, PAOs command the information by— z Understanding the media’s interests. z Staying tight organizationally, but loose tactically. z Remaining flexible. z Continuously re-examining options. Develop Third-Party Allies and Alliances 5-90. During crisis management, PAOs develop third-party allies and alliances. An outside agency’s favorable perception carries more support with all publics. To manage the crisis, PAOs develop relationships with elected officials, emergency response planning councils, and assistance agencies like the local Red Cross, civilian law enforcement, and chambers of commerce well before the crisis. Constantly Evaluate Messages and Their Feedback 5-91. The last principle involves evaluating sent messages and received feedback. PAOs keep lines of communication open after the crisis. Internally, they review what the crisis taught the commander about the effectiveness of the commander’s crisis management. Externally, PAOs have a plan to reestablish the commander’s good will with affected publics. Opinion research can tell PAOs how well the unit weathered a crisis and point the way for communication between the crises. PAOs evaluate sent messages and received feedback by— z Watching the situation on an hourly or daily basis to include monitoring media constantly throughout the crisis. z Maintaining contact with allies, publics, and stakeholders. z Using surveys, personal and public meetings, or focus groups to gauge information needs and perceptions. PAOs always seek proper authorities for conducting the aforementioned tactics. PROPOSED PUBLIC AFFAIRS GUIDANCE 5-92. Public affairs guidance is constraints and restraints established by proper authority regarding public communication activities (JP 3-61). It begins with the development of PPAG that recommends mission- specific guidance to support public discussion. PAG normally includes approved messages, talking points, and anticipated questions and answers used for preparing Soldiers for media engagements. PA personnel use this formal tool to shape and guide the Army’s public position on issues in response to questions (actual and anticipated) from the media. 5-93. PA personnel develop PPAG in time to coordinate and publish initial PAG with an order or before deployment if necessary. Coordinated PAG helps ensure those involved have unified voice and provides clear guidance on the authorization to release information to the media regarding the topic or issue. PAG is an internal document—Appendix 2 (Public Affairs Guidance) to Annex J (Public Affairs) of the operation order. This internal document assists leaders in units and organizations when discussing an upcoming deployment, exercise, or operation during interactions with the media and the public. PROPOSED PUBLIC AFFAIRS GUIDANCE PREPARATION 5-94. Commanders are responsible for developing and submitting PPAG through higher headquarters for approval at the appropriate level for designated military training exercises, multinational activities, contingencies, and events that could attract U.S. national and international media interest, as determined by the first general officer in the chain of command. A PAO higher headquarters can direct for development to PPAG, or developed independent of guidance for a known exercise or event and pushed higher for approval. 5-95. PPAG development includes PAOs researching the recommended PA posture, background on the subject, contingency statements, messages, talking points, anticipated media questions and answers, community engagement guidance, and details governing the release of information and imagery to the public. PAOs can also research the timing, location, means, and other details governing the release of information Chapter 5 5-14 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ to the public for the PPAG. PAOs write PAG to conform to operations security and privacy requirements. (See appendix B and DODI 5405.03 for detailed PPAG information.) PROPOSED PUBLIC AFFAIRS GUIDANCE COORDINATION 5-96. DOD policy requires that the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (ATSD [PA]) receives PPAG from combatant commands and others, as required, for all major operations. Upon receipt of the order, the commander, through the PAO, requests PAG from higher headquarters. PAG may be included in alert orders or operation orders. Commanders of major units direct their PAOs to prepare PPAG to forward the proposal through major commands and combatant command PA channels to the ATSD (PA). Commanders of combatant commands ensure that the staff coordinated the PPAG with appropriate organizations (such as embassies, country teams, host nation, governments, and subordinate commands) in the theater of operations whenever possible. PUBLIC AFFAIRS ANNEX J 5-97. Based on information developed during the planning process and reflected in the PA running estimate, PA planners develop a concept of PA support to operations. This plan reinforces the strategic goals and operational objectives and provides the commander’s intent for PA activities to inform identified key publics. During the orders production step of the MDMP, PA planners ensure that information critical to mission accomplishment and the commander’s intent for PA is captured in the text of the base operation order. PA planners present the complete plan in Annex J (Public Affairs) in the operation order. Annex J must address all the PA related transportation, communications, billeting, equipment, and personnel resources required to support the plan. See appendix C for fundamental considerations, formats, and instructions for Annex J (Public Affairs) of the operation order. 5-98. Annex J (Public Affairs) of the operation order varies depending on the echelon and plan. It accounts for local requirements and limitations with these variations. Annex J (Public Affairs) must include the following key tasks, regardless of the supported operation: z Coordinate frequently with operations, intelligence, legal, and foreign policy advisor staff to ensure the PAO has the latest information. z Cover release authority for information and timing of information release. z Include detailed procedures for all supporting commands for handling or forwarding information regarding queries, responses, interviews, and proposed news releases for clearance. z Provide guidelines for release of imagery, which may include imagery taken by Soldiers on the battlefield, as well as guidelines for use of digital media, to include release authority for communication products. z Include contact information to ensure subordinate units know who the release authority is and how to contact them. 5-99. Annex J (Public Affairs) dictates a unit’s OPSEC review process before releasing information into the public domain as required by AR 530-1. Following this annex protects both Soldiers and commanders from unnecessary OPSEC violations. The annex directs PA personnel check the sources of information to ensure OPSEC violations do not occur during the newsgathering process. It also directs PA personnel to check for OPSEC violations when staff suspect a potential violation. The annex directs PA staff to protect information identified as too sensitive to be made public. 5-100.Annex J (Public Affairs) dictates that PA staff ensure units follow proper OPSEC measures when sending products concerning military facilities to media news organizations. If PA staff discover OPSEC violations, PAOs first request the media representative remove the sensitive information. If the media representative refuses, the PAO transmits the story or release over secure channels to the ATSD (PA) for handling. If PA staffs find violations after a news organization has published or broadcast a story, they report the violation to the accrediting command. )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 6-1 Chapter 6 Media Facilitation MEDIA FACILITATION PROCESS 6-1. Media facilitation is the process of planning, preparing, executing, and assessing a media engagement. It occurs in tactical and home-station environments. Media facilitation provides assistance to civilian and military news media personnel, to include media embeds, to cover Army operations safely and effectively while speaking to Army leaders, Soldiers, and civilians. PA personnel must adhere to the DOD principles of information throughout the process. PA personnel must have access to information centers, operations centers, and adequate facilities to assist the media properly in receiving and telling the Army story. 6-2. Most media representatives strive to publish accurate, truthful, balanced stories without undermining, interfering, or misrepresenting the military, its operations, or activities. However, some stories may result in misunderstandings, errors, or criticisms. Commanders formulate and deliver accurate, timely, and culturally attuned messages to counter potential misperceptions and misunderstandings. When it comes to media facilitation, commanders also understand the impact of their actions on the publics’ perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs of the media. 6-3. As a core task, media facilitation is integral to the success of the PA mission. Media facilitation enables PA personnel to identify requirements for a planned and unplanned media engagement or media event. Annex J (Public Affairs) in the operation order describes the plan for media facilitation. PA planners ensure Annex J (Public Affairs) captures detailed processes, procedures, and support requirements for traditional, nontraditional, and digital news media methods. As the information environment changes rapidly, PA staff stay prepared to support emerging technology needs and increased nontraditional media interests in Army operations and activities. 6-4. Media facilitation includes tasks such as the following: z Assisting media representatives to enter an area of operations legally and safely. z Registering and credentialing media representatives. z Ensuring media representatives and SMEs understand ground rules for coverage. z Helping the media representatives understand security policies and constraints that require their compliance if they wish to continue Army coverage. z Arranging interviews and briefings. z Coordinating unit visits and escorts. z Assisting media representatives with transportation, messing, billeting, communication support, safety, and equipment. MEDIA ENGAGEMENTS 6-5. A media engagement is a specified instance of media interaction between a spokesperson and a member of the media. PA staff can prepare an individual media engagement or a large-scale media event. Media engagements may be planned or unplanned and may include interviews, briefings, or press conferences. PAOs identify an approved spokesperson (such as an SME or the unit commander) to conduct the media engagement and provide media representatives with key information that specifically corresponds with their area of expertise. 6-6. Media engagements require the PA staff to plan for the event and coordinate with the media organization or representatives and all individuals involved. PAOs typically receives discuss, and negotiate important information from the time that they receive the media query. Coordinating media engagement requests with higher headquarters PA staff may be necessary depending on the nature of the query. For Chapter 6 6-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ example, if the request is a national media query or has the potential to influence Service-level discussions, then the PA staff need to notify the higher headquarters PAOs. These PAOs often have insight on higher- level discussions and can provide sound PAG. MEDIA ACCESS 6-7. When in an active PA posture, PA professionals take a proactive approach to media facilitation. They ensure media representatives have access to leadership and relevant information. PA staff coordinates access for media representatives while ensuring coverage does not disrupt or negatively affect operations. 6-8. Media embeds are media representatives embedded to provide coverage that helps Soldiers and the public have a complete understanding of an operation. PAOs and commanders understand that media embeds may report on an operation during this time. Commanders may have the media embed accompany them during their travels to units or to events in the area of operations. Embedding media in tactical level units, or with commanders, requires PAOs to provide media interaction training to the unit. MEDIA KITS 6-9. PA staffs prepare and assemble media kits. Media kits are essential to proper media facilitation. When building a media kit, PA staffs ensure that they maintain OPSEC by removing any sensitive information. A media kit may contain the following items: z A schedule of events, to include contingency arrangements. z Strip maps, key routes, sites. z Unit fact sheets, such as unit history or other unit specific information. z Biographies of key personalities or keynote speakers. z Copies of final approved keynote speeches (if possible). z Relevant press releases, media advisories, or special events calendars. z Relevant photos with captions. z A video release list, containing hyperlinks or uniform resource locaters (commonly called URLs) to relevant video releases. z Frequently asked questions. z Army 101 information (such as command and organizational structure, rank structure, and other structures). z PA points of contact. 6-10. While media kits are essential to media facilitation, they are also essential to spokesperson preparation. A media kit can assist a commander or designated spokesperson to prepare for an upcoming media engagement. Making sure to include responses-to-queries (RTQs) can provide the spokesperson with released information and assists in preventing inconsistent comments. Complete media kits include media representative background information, anticipated media questions, relevant key command messages and talking points, and fact sheets to help the spokesperson answer the media representative’s questions. While unanticipated questions may arise, the information contained in the media kit will assist commanders or designated spokespersons develop their answers for the media engagement. COORDINATION AND SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS 6-11. PA leaders and staffs ensure proper coordination and support from the start of planning and throughout an operation. PA staffs identify facilities capable of assisting the media in telling the Army story. PA planners identify these requirements in the PA running estimate and in Annex J (Public Affairs) in the operation order. PA staffs ensure that they identify the right Army personnel and equipment for media facilitation during planning. (For more on coordination and planning, see chapter 5.) 6-12. PA staffs make every effort to provide access, transportation, and communication capabilities to media representatives. Throughout the planning process and an operation, PA planners identify existing and projected media representatives along with their capabilities and requirements. These include information acquisition means, satellite communication capabilities, transportation needs, and language translation. PA Media Facilitation )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 6-3 planners also provide an estimate of the logistics support required for embedded media such as billeting, food, security, and personal protective equipment. Transportation of media representatives must follow procedures and guidelines outlined in the operation order and DODI 5122.08. 6-13. Media escort personnel are facilitators appointed to help the news media representatives obtain accurate coverage of an operation or event. Escorts assist media representatives for the duration of their time with the unit, to include movement around the area of operations. While PA-trained personnel are the preferred escorts, they are not always available. An appointed escort receives training on interaction with media representatives, their information needs, and knowledgeable about the unit, mission, and area. Media escorts will not interfere in the reporting process unless they suspect OPSEC or ground rule violations. Ground rules clarify the left and right limits that media representatives or media organizations have during an interview or engagement. If an OPSEC or ground rule violation occurs, the media escort immediately executes the rules of media engagement prescribed by the PAO and contacts the PAO for additional guidance. MEDIA OPERATIONS CENTER 6-14. The media operations center is a facility established by the commander to serve as the focal point for the interface between the military and the media during the conduct of military operations (JP 3-61). The MOC is the primary information center for media representatives. It provides commanders and PA staffs an unclassified venue to discuss operations with the media and provides journalists a place to obtain information quickly and efficiently. 6-15. PA planning answers the following when considering the establishment of a MOC: z Does the operation require a MOC? z Is augmentation required for MOC establishment and staffing? z What is the MOC operational battle rhythm? z What does the planning for a hasty MOC require? 6-16. A MOC provides the commander with PA personnel prepared to quickly provide RTQs and fulfil media facilitation requirements. The MOC provides the following benefits and functions: z A single point of contact and information source for media within the theater. z Briefings and enforcement of media guidelines and ground rules. z Primary information release authority for the senior PAO. z Coordination of news media coverage with various echelons. z Coordination with unified action partners for each Service, agency, or country. z Identification and communication of host nation’s culturally sensitive topics to personnel in theater. z Preparation for conducting press briefings and news conferences. z Registration, sustainment, and movement of news media personnel. 6-17. As fully independent units, a TPASE and MPAD are currently organized, trained, and prepared to fulfill the requirement for MOC establishment and staffing. These units are designed specifically to serve as MOCs at theater, corps, or division echelons. 6-18. In most cases, MOC staffing requires augmentation either by individual PA-trained personnel or by Army PA units. Commanders can combine MPADs to form media sub-centers in forward battle areas. PA leaders may call on PA personnel from nondeployed commands and installation PA sections to augment MOC staff; however, PA leaders need to coordinate requests for individual augmentation through operational channels. PA leaders can augment with Reserve and Guard unit personnel on a voluntary basis. MEDIA OPERATIONS CENTER ORGANIZATION 6-19. MOCs support the operational commander and are subordinate to the commander’s PAO. PA Soldiers serve in all sections of the MOC. The commander coordinates with the PAO and staff to determine the MOC organization and staffing. Traditionally, a MOC has two distinct sections: a headquarters section and a media operations section. Chapter 6 6-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ 6-20. The headquarters section includes the MOC’s director, deputy director, NCO in charge, and select support staff. The MOC director and deputy work closely with and answer to the command PAO. The NCO in charge and support staff is normally task-organized to support tailored forward-deployed MOC teams or sub-MOCs. This task organization provides administrative support; coordinates lease and purchase contracting; sets up, operates, and maintains the unit’s equipment; and conducts day-to-day operations of the MOC. The headquarters section is responsible for MOC communications, supply operations, vehicle maintenance, security, and other support functions as required. 6-21. The media operations section includes the PA Soldiers. The Soldiers are normally organized to support planning cells, a media facilitation section, and regional and local non-English speaking media. This organization is also responsible for media transportation, registration, badging and facilitation, as well as coordinating briefing area set-up, responses to query, and assisting in media content analysis. 6-22. When the commander establishes a MOC, PA staff adapt the organization of the MOC to the operational requirements. Commanders can also design the MOC to include a plans and operations (future and current operations) section, a media support and engagement section, command information section, monitoring and assessment section, and digital media section. MEDIA OPERATIONS CENTER OPERATIONS 6-23. Army commanders know they will encounter media in any major operation. They typically deploy a PA unit as one of the first elements to establish the MOC. This is in anticipation of media facilitation requirements based on the following assumptions: z Media representatives will arrive in an area of operations at the start of, and in most cases, before an operation begins without access to official information. z Misinformation and disinformation is prevalent during operations when an established area of operations lacks an official source of military information. z Current technologies aid in the proliferation of independent media across the area of operations, which requires a robust capability to analyze and assess the information environment. z Media interest in noncombat operations will peak at the outset but may taper off over time. During a high-intensity conflict, media interest will remain high. 6-24. During joint operations, MOCs support and answer to the senior commander on a 24-hour basis. The unified commander usually establishes MOCs to support the news media in an area of operations. To achieve an initial operating capability, a MOC performs the following: z Establish a “hasty media center” as the initial focal point for the news media until additional media support arrive. z Establish communication with higher headquarters and other PA assets in theater. z Begin to establish command structure and lines of authority. z Request information release authority in the theater of operations. z Begin coordinating with appropriate authority for leasing and purchasing contracts when necessary. z Contact and begin to register news media personnel in the area. z Begin RTQ from accredited media representatives. z Provide media support with coordinated media access to subordinate units and with media escort as resources permit. Assist or conduct briefings and conferences. z Coordinate media contact with units or individuals to include SME interviews. z Prepare media kits; provide news releases, fact sheets, copies of transcripts for briefings and conferences, and copies of archived products. z When other means are not available, help coordinate transportation (to and from interview sources), transmission of media products, and food and billeting. z Provide limited media escort capabilities in the area. Units pre-establish standard operating procedures for MOCs for each theater of operation and for media operations in that theater. Media Facilitation )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 6-5 A MOC will achieve full operational capability when it can conduct 24-hour continuous operations at full staffing with all sections and conduct all command-required functions for an indefinite period. Accreditation versus Registration 6-25. Operations in the MOC entail accreditation and registration. Accreditation is the verification and validation that a person represents a legitimate commercial news organization (both U.S. and foreign). This means that accrediting governments or military organizations physically verify an applicant’s affiliation with a specific news organization. When overseas, the host-nation government generally decides to accredit a news media organization in coordination with the combined or unified commander. 6-26. When the host nation does not require accreditation, the combined or unified commander has responsibility for this determination. Accreditation is normally performed at corps level or higher and in line with directives from Office of the ATSD (PA). (See DA Form 7674 [Media Accreditation/Embed Application] for more on accreditation.) 6-27. Media registration is part of the system that identifies and tracks media organizations movements and their locations in the area of operations. The information gained by registering media helps staffs in planning and conducting media logistics support and transportation, and in preparing subordinate commands for media encounters. It also helps commanders seeking to engage media regarding newsworthy events. A completed registration records correspondent names, agencies, contact information, and other relevant data. It also identifies which news media representatives or agencies have asked for military assistance and access, and which have agreed to the commander’s media ground rules. 6-28. Registration procedure requires— z The media representative to—  Complete the registration form.  Accept the media ground rules to include the hold harmless agreement and reimbursement agreement (see Appendix F for sample agreements). Both agreements will require a legal review prior to implementation. z PA personnel to—  Gain a legal review of the hold harmless agreement and reimbursement agreement.  Provide a copy of the documentation to the media representative.  Verify the media representatives have required gear to accomplish their mission. Be prepared to issue personal protection gear if required using a DA Form 2062 (Hand Receipt). Attach both agreements to the registration form and file form in the media reception log. Media Access and Support 6-29. MOC operations ensure media access and support. Army and media representatives who have a vested interest in military activities maintain a continuous dialogue. Open and independent reporting is the principal means to cover military events. Such reporting facilitates media representatives’ understanding of military events and occurrences so their coverage is accurate and timely. PA personnel normally do not interfere with media reporting unless they suspect OPSEC, command guidance, or ground rules violations. 6-30. Consistent with operational conditions, commanders support PA personnel with facilities to ensure the timely, secure, and compatible transmission of media information products. When Army support is unavailable, the media transmit their information products using their own resources. Media Credentials 6-31. The third support that MOC operations provides is credentialing media representatives. Credentialing is a specific type of accreditation that grants journalists more access to otherwise restricted areas. Credentialing a media representative involves vetting the representative as a legitimate journalist as well as the journalist agreeing to abide to ground rules. Commanders used media credentialing to allow legitimate media access to cover military activities in the United States and in deployed operations. Units do not afford media representatives without credentials the same access as credentialed media representatives. Chapter 6 6-6 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ Commanders ensure all media representatives on their installation or in their operational area understand and have access to all information required for proper credentialing. When units encounter non-credentialed media, commanders and PAOs encourage these media representatives to register at the appropriate MOC. 6-32. The PAO or MOC director at the appropriate echelon establishes media credentialing guidelines (normally corps and above). Credentialing ensures Soldiers recognize and treat media representatives as legitimate journalists accordingly under the law of war. During joint operations, the joint force registers embedded media who then carry those identifying credentials, as appropriate, as well as Geneva Convention cards. Commanders do not provide information to non-credentialed and unregistered media representatives without guidance from the PAO or the MOC director. 6-33. Journalists seeking credentials to cover military activities must agree to ground rules tailored to the specific event or operation established by the approving commander, PAO, or MOC director. Violations of ground rules can result in suspension of credentials. During operations, the decision to suspend credentials or expel a reporter is made only with the approval of the joint force or combatant commander. In garrison or home station, the authority to suspend or expel a reporter rests with the installation senior mission commander. All journalists, registered or not, are expected to abide by established media ground rules. 6-34. The MOC staff provides credentialed media with badges that distinguish them from other civilians in the area, clearly identifies off-limits areas, and provides escorts as needed. When badging a media representative, the MOC personnel issue the media badge and log it in by control number. At a minimum, the credentialed media badge includes the following information, indicating the media has been accredited by the MOC: z Photo of named person. z Name of person badged. z Issue date and expiration date. z Agency issuing badge. z Name of issuing authority. z Control number. z Signature block of approval authority. Ground Rules 6-35. Operations in the MOC establish ground rules for media organizations and their representatives. Ground rules protect the media and Soldiers from the release of information that could threaten their security or safety. These rules are not intended to prevent the release of derogatory, embarrassing, negative, or uncomplimentary information. Ground rules align the media’s interest to report on military operations in a timely manner with security and safety concerns. Media ground rules also include requirements that protect the health and welfare of the media. These rules identify places the media can go, off-limits areas, places the media can or cannot photograph, and procedures for requesting interviews. 6-36. Media ground rules include information on the process for the release of information, safety or access procedures, access to the internet if not commercially available, and constraints or limitations regarding interviews, such as the amount of time available and topics for the interview. Ground rules also include the process for unintended exposure or release of classified information. (See JP 3-61 for more information on ground rules.) The MOC provides ground rules to the media as soon as possible during the credentialing process. 6-37. In multinational operations, appropriate multinational command and staff channels develop and implement responsibilities for establishing media ground rules, credentialing media, and, if necessary, expulsion of media. Media Pools 6-38. MOC operations monitor media pools. A media pool is a limited number of news media selected to provide content to multiple news organizations during specified activities or operations. Media pools are not the standard for reporting Army operations but can be implemented when conditions warrant or constraints exist. Pools should be as large as possible and be disbanded at the earliest opportunity—ideally within 24 to Media Facilitation )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 6-7 36 hours of the conclusion of the operation. Commanders who knowingly create a media pool place additional support requirements on the organization. (See JP 3-61 for more information on media pools.) 6-39. The arrival of early-access pools does not cancel independent coverage for media representatives already in the area. Even under conditions of open coverage, media pools may be appropriate where seating is limited, at remote locations, or on ships. In such circumstances, PA planners specify what mediums—such as print, broadcast, and others—form the pool to ensure adequate scope and distribution of coverage. Media representatives determine who fills the spaces in the pool. Media pool selection includes designation of a team leader. This team leader ensures that members of the media pool meet their obligation to share information. Army PA personnel do not get involved in settling internal disputes of the media pool. 6-40. The military is responsible for transporting media pools when operationally necessary or under conditions of constrained access to an event. To ensure complete coverage of an event, commanders provide dedicated transportation if able. When commanders decide media pools are necessary, PA planning includes reimbursement from the media depending on location and availability of commercial transportation. Media Query 6-41. MOC operations oversee answering media queries. Media queries are a request for information from the media. Upon receiving a query, PA personnel record the query, maintain query-tracking systems, and ensure they answer all questions as quickly as possible, being careful to not commit to a specific timeframe. 6-42. PA personnel only answer questions with information that is accurate and cleared for public release. (See appendix F for Privacy Act considerations.) PA staff need to scrub all RTQs free of jargon as well include explanations of any military terms. 6-43. Before PA staff release any information, the release authority must approve it. In the case of accidents, PA staffs customarily respond that the accident remains under investigation and they cannot release names. In the case of a death of a Service member, they cannot release names until 24 hours after the next of kin are notified. PA staff do not release conditions of patients. Patients’ conditions are released from hospitals and may be categorized as treated and released, stable, serious or critical. (See AR 360-1 for nonreleasable information.) 6-44. A RTQ is recommended when there is a desire not to take action to generate media or public interest beyond responding to media queries. On occasion, the public affairs posture is RTQ until a certain point in the planning and execution of an operation, exercise, or event. At that time, the RTQ posture may change to active. On other occasions, the public affairs posture will remain passive for the duration or until completion of the military operation, exercise, or event. Media Embed 6-45. Lastly, MOC operations oversee and track media embeds. Embedded media is the Army’s most widely used method of civilian media coverage to tell the Army story due to the proximity to the Soldiers and the mission. Through embedded media, commanders can counter misinformation and disinformation by allowing the media access to actual events enabling their ability for to report on a firsthand account. The embedded media program aims to provide as much transparency as possible of military operations to keep the public informed. To achieve this, units strive to embed media representatives at the lowest level possible. 6-46. Once the higher headquarters clears a media representative for embedding, PA personnel begin the reception procedures as follows: z Receive and credential all media personnel in accordance with higher headquarters and combatant command policies. z Provide an operational overview or background information to include a media kit or approved releasable briefings that can be shared while maintaining OPSEC. z Ensure media representatives have proper field gear and protective gear prior to hand-off to subordinate unit. z Plan and coordinate a commander interview or greeting (if possible) before hand-off to subordinate units. z Coordinate with respective UPAR and media escort for media hand-over. Chapter 6 6-8 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ z Provide daily media situation reports to higher PA headquarters. Upon conclusion of the media embed, provide a media after action review to the next higher level PAO. 6-47. PA personnel use the following items to construct an after action review: z A PA log that the PAO has used to record a chronological list of actions of all PA assets used in the process. z Audio or visual documentation of the media’s interaction such as interviews or broadcast products. z All products produced by the media representative to include newspaper articles, magazine articles, and social media posts. z Documentation of issues encountered and lessons learned. 6-48. Embed termination occurs when the embedded media representatives indicate their intentions to end their stay with the unit. Hosting command PAOs, or UPARs, coordinate with the higher echelon PAO to transport the embedded media representative out of the area of responsibility. The credentialing organization debriefs all media departing theater on OPSEC considerations. )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 7-1 Chapter 7 Public Communication PUBLIC COMMUNICATION OVERVIEW 7-1. PA is inherent in all military activities. As a key enabler, PA manages and delivers public information through public communication. In Army PA, public communication is the communication between the Army and international, national, and local publics. Through CCS, PA personnel develop plans, themes, and messages to inform audiences, deter competitors, and defeat adversaries. 7-2. Public communication is the receipt and exchange of ideas and opinions that contribute to shaping public understanding of, and discourse with the Army. The U.S. military has an obligation to communicate with its members and the U.S. public; it is in the national interest for the U.S. military to communicate with international publics. The proactive release of accurate information to domestic and international audiences puts joint operations in context, facilitates informed perceptions about military operations, undermines adversarial propaganda, and helps achieve national, strategic, and operational objectives. Effective public communication fosters a culture of engagement in which Soldiers and leaders confidently and comfortably engage various publics. PUBLIC COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES 7-3. Public communication includes the release of official information through news releases, public service announcements, media engagements, town halls, senior Soldier and leader engagements, and social networks. Public communication enables the commander in their obligation to keep the American people and the Army informed while deterring competitors and defeating adversaries. Public communication objectives are: z Increase public awareness of the Army’s mission, policies, and programs. z Foster good relations with the communities the Army interacts with at home and abroad. z Maintain the Army’s reputation as a respected professional organization responsible for national security. z Support the Army’s recruiting and personnel procurement mission. z Use information to deter competitors and defeat adversaries. 7-4. An active approach to public communication requires specific objectives, courses of action, and the identification of potential obstacles. Public communication engagements are impacted by media coverage, which heighten media facilitation efforts and communication strategies. AUDIENCES, STAKEHOLDERS, AND KEY PUBLICS 7-5. Effective public communication requires that PA professionals properly identify the intended recipients of PA themes, messages, narratives, and talking points, while distinguishing among audiences, stakeholders, and key publics. An audience is a broad, roughly defined group based on common characteristics. It defines a population that contains relevant stakeholders. Generally, military communications to audiences are broad in scope, often indirect, and without feedback. Examples of audiences can include the following: z The American people. z DOD military, civilians, contractors, and family members. z Partner nations and allied forces. z International, host-nation, and local communities as well as adversaries. Chapter 7 7-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ 7-6. PA planners assess the need to communicate with stakeholders based on the extent to which an operation or action may affect them. A stakeholder is an individual or group that is directly impacted by military operations, actions, and/or outcomes, and whose interests positively or negatively motivate them toward action (JP 3-61). A stakeholder’s actions or decisions can also have an impact on military operations. Examples of stakeholders can include individuals in government, NGOs, or individuals that live outside a military base. 7-7. A stakeholder who communicates more actively with the military is a type of public. The more actively publics engage, the more PA staff prioritize public communication with them. A key public only arises out of the PA planning process. PAOs narrow down this segmented group that the Army deems it important to inform. Key publics do not form the basis of a communication approach, but rather serve as the beginning of the planning process for determining stakeholders and assessing key publics. A military force can tailor its communication to a key public. See figure 7-1 for examples of key publics. Figure 7-1. Examples of key publics 7-8. PA planners identify organizational stakeholders to help determine particular key publics among a list of possible audiences. PA planners may identify many different key publics depending upon the particular PA objective, campaign, or initiative. For example, PA planners may identify local citizens as a possible audience to communicate information to about an upcoming large-scale deployment of Soldiers at an installation. Because of the potential economic impact of the deployment to the local community, PA planners identify local business owners as a key public. 7-9. Developed lists of key publics and issues stakeholders—individuals with vested interest—keep PA staff informed and updated about military activities. Efficient PA staff periodically update these lists. PA staffs prepare these community-based lists locally and keep them up to date. Conducting an assessment of key publics and stakeholders helps to develop the following: z A more comprehensive crisis communication strategy. z An assessment of the key publics’ needs. z An evaluation of the relationships between an organization and the key publics. 7-10. This assessment helps professional communicators develop outreach initiatives and determine the community’s information needs. It is important, especially in a crisis, that PAOs prioritize affected publics. Public Communication )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 7-3 This makes their job of communicating more manageable and makes the best use of time. PA staffs establish a tool, technique, or procedure to reach every segment of their identified publics. 7-11. The relationship between commanders and different audiences is integral to PA. Commanders build and sustain positive relationships with key publics. Management of public communication programs is a PA function. Outside the United States, public communication is often a coordinated effort with other IRCs. Regardless of location, public communication strategies help civic leaders and local populations understand the activities of nearby installations and units. The type of audience determines the information that commanders share. INTERNAL AUDIENCE 7-12. Service members, contractors, DA Civilians, and their Families compose an internal audience. Commanders use command information programs as the primary means to communicate their internal audience. Service members of the internal audience include Regular Army, Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States, and United States Army Reserve, retirees and veterans. Commanders share information with OPSEC parameters and recognize that an informed force is a more ready, reliable, and resilient force. DOMESTIC AUDIENCE 7-13. Commanders have an obligation to inform the American public about its military and its impact on the community. This communication increases public trust and support through active engagements.Through public communication programs, the military demonstrates it is a community partner and a responsible steward of national resources. Examples of public communication programs include news releases, public service announcements, media engagements, and social networks. INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE 7-14. An international audience consists of publics from allies, unified action partners, and host nations. International interest in military operations may be as high as, and sometimes higher than, U.S. media interest, especially in military operations conducted outside the continental United States. The Army coordinates and communicates with other agencies, organizations, and nations. Within the constraints of OPSEC, the DOD, Department of State, and allied and partner nations keep the international community informed about Army operations and activities. Before releasing information to international audiences, PAOs consider a host nation’s culturally sensitive topics. COMPETITORS AND ADVERSARIES 7-15. The last type of audience that concern PA staffs consists of competitors and adversaries. PA personnel distribute timely, truthful, and accurate information regarding U.S. intentions and actions. Commanders use the information to counter adversary and enemy misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda and to deter adversary and enemy actions. Volatility in the information environment requires PA and all other IRCs to synchronize their communication efforts to deter actions by adversaries. SEGMENTING AND DIRECTED MESSAGING 7-16. It is important, especially in a crisis, to prioritize key publics. PA personnel deliver themes, messages, narratives, and talking points according to this prioritization. Prioritization of key publics requires that PA planners segment publics. 7-17. Segmentation is separating publics by demographics (who the audience is) and psychographics (how the audience thinks in terms of values, attitudes, and lifestyle) to enable more effective communication. It usually involves dividing publics into various groups according to established criteria. Members of each resulting key public have at least one factor in common with other key publics. PA personnel update their understanding of, and communications efforts to, segmented key publics continuously since the digital media updates in real time. Segmenting publics allows PAOs to plan for more targeted and effective communication. The PAO uses research and communication theory to identify and segment publics and to develop creative Chapter 7 7-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ communication plans and tailored outreach programs. See the vignette on segmentation for a sample segmentation message. (See JP 3-61 for more on segmenting key publics.) 7-18. Directed messaging occurs when commanders use public communication for key publics. Commanders achieve this more effective means of communication through themes, messages, narratives, and talking points directed at segmented key publics. PA personnel tailor such messages and talking points to the particular intended key public, when possible. Segmentation Former Commander of the Combined Arms Center Lieutenant General William B.
Caldwell described this process of research-based audience segmentation when he reflected on his appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in March of 2008. “When we were invited to share about Field Manual (FM) 3-0, Operations, on ‘The Daily Show,’ I must admit, I was less than convinced that we should do it. It was not until the Army’s chief of public affairs reminded me of Jon Stewart’s primary audience, an audience of men and women between the age of 17 and 35, the most attractive advertising demographic and, coincidentally, the same demographic as our Soldiers, He reminded me that our Soldiers more than anyone needed to understand the importance of FM 3-0, and this clearly was a golden opportunity to reach them.” One might incorrectly assume that, upon seeing this unique appearance of a general officer on a nighttime talk show, the intent of such an engagement was to reach a broad audience of the American people. On the contrary, however, this represented the creative public affairs planning—and more specifically, the segmentation of key publics—that enabled a senior Army leader to reach an internal audience of young Soldiers through this “out of the box” medium of disseminating the message regarding changes to FM 3-0. Furthermore, a nuanced understanding of the demographics of Jon Stewart’s audience helped public affairs planners posit this engagement opportunity as an effective on to reach the intended, segmented key public. COMMAND INFORMATION 7-19. Public communication implements command information. Command information is communication by a military organization directed to the internal audience. This audience includes Soldiers, civilians, contractors, and their family members. This information creates an awareness of the organization’s goals, informs them of significant developments affecting them and the organization, increases their effectiveness as ambassadors of the organization, and keeps them informed about what is going on in the organization. (See JP 3-61 for more information on command information.) RESOURCES 7-20. PAOs have several resources to carry out the organization’s command information mission. These include publications and video services, the CORE platform, DVIDS, and different social and digital media, such as the American Forces Radio and Television Series (known as AFRTS) which is managed under DODM 5120.20. Installation and Organizational Publications and Video Services 7-21. The Army uses installation and organizational publications and video services to communicate directly with the internal audience on its installations. Civilian enterprise publications, such as Army newspapers and Army funded publications, such as unit newsletters or magazines, can deliver the commander’s communication objectives, themes, and messages to this audience. Additionally, commanders may elect to use installation broadcast capabilities to disseminate information to Soldiers and families via a command television channel. PA professionals manage these various distribution means effectively and recommend to Public Communication )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 7-5 the commander appropriate ways to communicate via each. (See AR 360-1 for additional guidelines for using these publications and services.) CORE 7-22. Commanders use CORE as another method to communicate with people on installations. CORE is the content management platform and publishing tool provided to Army PA personnel. PA personnel use the CORE website to publish articles, upload images and documents, and create web pages for units and organizations. Units and organizations are permitted to have a CORE organization page. The Army encourages all PAOs to register for an account on CORE to publish content on the Army.mil official web page. Authorized personnel review and approve all content submitted to CORE for release in accordance with the local chain of command. The CORE website is located at https://www.army.mil/core. Defense Visual Information Distribution Service 7-23. The DVIDS is a third resource used for command information. This service, under the direction of Defense Media Activity, is a network of portable satellite transmitters and network links connected to a distribution hub in Atlanta. This system enables media organizations to request products, conduct broadcast- quality interviews, and to receive images, video footage, and print stories from the DVIDS distribution hub. Service members can access the distribution hub when deployed to support a range of military operations. In terms of an organization’s command information mission, DVIDS provides a digital platform for PA professionals to upload, organize, and feature their products to an internal audience. Social and Digital Media 7-24. For an organization’s command information mission, social and digital media provide a digital platform for PA professionals to share their products with an internal audience. While installation and organizational publications offer traditional ways of communicating with the command, other forms of communication have evolved. Social media and internet-based communication now provide additional, two- way communication between a military organization and its audiences. As technology and capabilities evolve, managing digital and social media becomes an essential component for communicating effectively. 7-25. All information posted on a publicly accessible website or social media platform is public information. All information published via social or digital media must comply with Army and DOD guidance for the release of information. These publications include AR 25-1, AR 25-2, AR 25-22, AR 380-5, AR 381-12, AR 530-1, DODD 1344.10, DODI 5230.29, and JP 3-13. 7-26. PA professionals must understand the effectiveness social media operations have communicating quickly and effectively with key publics. For instance, installations can use social media platforms to announce weather hazards, gate closures, or traffic issues to inform the local public near an installation. During a military operation, commanders consider all dissemination capabilities available to communicate releasable details and the role of the military in the operation. (See Chapter 9 for more on digital media management and social media.) Additional Resources 7-27. A PAO has numerous other means available to carry out the organization’s command information mission. These include the following: z Service magazines often segmented based on a specialty such as aviation, armor, infantry, or on a Service component such as National Guard or Reserve. z Town hall meetings where a commander can inform various members of the internal audience about operations, policies, and issues affecting them. z Command events such as unit formations. z Displays such as billboards or posters. Chapter 7 7-6 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 7-28. Commander have other considerations to balance when preparing command information. They consider the information they disseminate and its secondary audiences. While command information is intended to communicate internally, commanders recognize that released information in today’s information environment often becomes readily available to all publics. Commanders consider potential effects of those other audiences obtaining such information. 7-29. Commanders consider other uses of command information. Command information is an excellent venue to share and promote the Army culture. Commanders can use command information to incorporate and reinforce the five essential characteristics of the Army Profession (trust, military expertise, honorable service, ésprit de corps, and stewardship) and the Army Ethic. They can also share with Army personnel the three-certification criteria of Army professionals (competence, character, and commitment). The guidance in ADP 1 frames the characteristics and criteria for success as an Army professional. 7-30. In the event of a crisis, commanders consider the most effective methods to get information out quickly. Usually it is important to notify the internal audience first through PA professionals using command channels and social media platforms. Each PA professional can serve as a potential ambassador to deliver coherent messages and talking points from the commander to an external audience. The speed of communication across the social media landscape magnifies this ambassador effect and requires that PA professionals quickly and efficiently inform the internal audience at the outset of a crisis. (See Chapter 5 for more on crisis communication.) COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT 7-31. Community engagement is public affairs activities that support the relationship between military and civilian communities (JP 3-61). These activities involve working collaboratively with, and through, groups of people affiliated by geographic proximity or special interest to enhance the understanding and support for the Army, Soldiers, and operations. 7-32. Community engagement places special emphasis on two-way communications with identified publics and communities surrounding military installations. It recognizes that a positive rapport between the Army and its host communities is mutually beneficial, supporting the Army as an institution as well as its individual Soldiers. 7-33. During military operations, personnel may be involved in activities that engage the community. All community engagement activities support the commander’s communication objectives. Senior military leaders have responsibilities to engage key leaders in their operational areas, including those from other government agencies and NGOs. PA staff assists in identifying key leaders and recommending opportunities for military engagement. 7-34. The Army relies on communities and regions surrounding its installations for direct and indirect support. Communities provide the Army access to resources needed to train and maintain readiness as well as extend support to families of mobilized or deployed Soldiers. Army Family members, who represent Army Values and ideals, serve as community ambassadors. Commanders recognize that a positive rapport between the Army and its host communities is mutually beneficial, supporting the Army as an institution as well as its individual Soldiers. 7-35. A public engagement is any interaction between a Soldier and the public. A public engagement can be planned or unplanned, can occur anywhere Soldiers are, and may have positive, neutral, or negative effects depending on circumstances of the engagement. PA professionals must be ready to support media operations and facilitation if a public engagement garners media attention. 7-36. Members of the Army National Guard and United States Army Reserve live and work in the community and are integral members of their hometowns. A public’s positive relationship with a local reserve unit or an active-duty installation stems from the command. A commander considers potential implications of every installation activity, operation, or major training activity. This is especially important during crisis management, mobilization, deployment, and redeployment operations, even if the installation or reserve unit is not directly involved. A commander also considers potential implications during national events concerning politically sensitive or controversial DA or DOD issues. During such times, the information Public Communication )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 7-7 requirements of internal and external audiences increase dramatically. Installation and reserve unit commanders and their staffs—advised, counseled, and supported by their PA elements—need to implement effective PA programs that include open, honest, accurate, complete, and timely release of information based on information needs. Further details on community engagement can be found in DODI 5410.19. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS ARMY OUTREACH DIVISION 7-37. The OCPA Outreach Division is located at the Pentagon, conducting community engagement and outreach for the Headquarters, DA. As the senior outreach arm for the OCPA, OCPA Outreach Division ensures PAOs and commanders in the field know their available resources for telling the Army story. This division also keeps them current on Army and DOD policy. OCPA Outreach executes national and regional outreach activities to communicate key themes and messages directly to the American public to maintain their trust and confidence in the United States Army. The outreach actions are often unfiltered by news media sources and use Soldiers as spokespeople. OCPA outreach consists of the headquarters section, executive communications team, and three field offices. The OCPA Outreach Division’s key tasks are to— z Execute and coordinate major community engagement campaigns and legacy events (such as Meet Your Army, Army Birthday, and Army forums, competitions, and commemorative events) and acquire specific venues to provide Army visibility with the American public. z Support and shape movies, documentaries, television programs, and books produced by others about the Army. z Develop resources for Army PA field offices (such as campaigns and websites) and provide resources for Army PA field offices (such as speakers, policy or legal reviews, aerial and non- aerial support approvals, responses to public queries, and field band liaisons). z Develop and maintain relationships with audiences (such as veteran service organizations, Joint Civilian Orientation, civilian aides to the Secretary of the Army, Reserve ambassadors, talk show producers, organizations, and major sport teams) OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS NORTHEAST REGIONAL OFFICE 7-38. Located in New York City, OCPA Northeast develops public support for the Army and its Soldiers through community outreach, media engagements, and support to veterans and military support organizations from Maine to Maryland. The office coordinates Army participation at events including Army Senior Leader engagements, color guards, bands, ceremonial units, aerial demonstration teams, flyovers, static displays of Army equipment, and Soldier and Family recognition. OCPA Northeast pitches Army story ideas to national- level and local-based media, places Army leaders and SMEs in appropriate media settings, provides media advisories and responses to queries, and assists with media requests to cover Army units in its area of operations (Regular Army, Guard, Reserve, and Army schools). OCPA Northeast is the approval authority for authors requesting Army assistance with book projects. The OCPA Northeast regional office coordinates requests for support for community events with Army installations and units worldwide. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS MIDWEST REGIONAL OFFICE 7-39. Located in downtown Chicago, OCPA Midwest develops public support for the Army and its Soldiers. This regional office uses community outreach, media engagements, and support to veterans and military support organizations. OCPA Midwest spans across the 16-state Midwest region that includes Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.The OCPA Midwest regional office connects citizens with the Army network by serving as the principal Army PA liaison for professional sports franchises, media, and communities of interest and veterans service organizations. The OCPA Midwest regional office promotes the U.S. Army and informs its local public about various military events including Army programs, projects, information, and initiatives. The OCPA Midwest uses outreach efforts involving veterans, civic, and military- affiliated organizations as well as special events coordinating Army speakers when requested. This regional office also coordinates events for organizations, civic leaders, and communities to honor local Soldiers. Chapter 7 7-8 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS WEST 7-40. Located in Van Nuys, California, OCPA West, also known as the Army Entertainment Office, is the Army’s direct liaison to the entertainment industry. The staff at OCPA West assists major motion picture and television professionals to tell the Army story. OCPA West personnel work directly with members of the entertainment industry to ensure their project accurately portrays Soldiers and the Army. The OCPA West staff assists the entertainment industry by reviewing feature film and television scripts, providing on-site technical military assistance to filmmakers, and coordinating documentary coverage of the Army. In addition, OCPA West personnel seek opportunities to showcase the American Soldier through community outreach, media engagements, and community liaison. OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES 7-41. PA staff participate in community engagement through many outreach opportunities. A community engagement program consists of command-initiated actions that effectively inform civilians about the Army and maintain a viable relationship with the civilian community. Examples of official community engagement programs include partnering with organizations; using exhibits, bands, color guards, and other ceremonial units at civilian events; and hosting open houses and active installation tours. Unofficial community engagement programs may include any program that involves Soldiers interacting directly with a civilian community. Such unofficial events can include participating or supporting educational, religious, organizational, recreational, and youth programs or volunteering at a community organization. (See AR 360-1 for more information and restrictions on programs and activities for support to community events.) 7-42. A specific community engagement involves Medal of Honor recipients. Medal of Honor PA support oversees all Medal of Honor programs. The Pentagon’s OCPA Outreach Division leads the communication efforts in these programs. This division coordinates all Medal of Honor communication activities in partnership with the Army G-1. Pre-ceremony, G-1 is the lead with OCPA Outreach supporting. Post- ceremony, OCPA Outreach coordinates media and outreach activities for both living active duty recipients and next-of-kin of posthumous recipients. PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY EVENTS 7-43. PAOs carefully manage the commander’s community engagement program. These officers research various options and means to engage with the community as well as recommend appropriate community engagement opportunities to the commander. PAOs also plan and execute community events involving command participation and then collect feedback from participants. Community events can include providing speakers, hosting tours and open houses, participating on community councils, coordinating ceremonial units for events, and attending town halls. Speaker’s Bureau 7-44. A speaker’s bureau is composed of a pool of volunteer Service members prepared to speak on various topics. This bureau can effectively share the commander’s messages to various segments of the local community. PA personnel prepare these Service members to speak on various topics, including their jobs, the installation and its mission, and specific issues affecting the organization and the local community. The PA staff is responsible for maintaining a ready pool of speakers, evaluating requests from local civic organizations, and coordinating speaking engagements for participating Service members. Installation and Distinguished Visitor Tours and Open Houses 7-45. PAOs manage community events such as installation tours, distinguished visitor tours (commonly known as VIP tours), and open houses. These events help PAOs effectively maintain good relations with an element of the civilian community or the community at large. When conducted, command-sponsored civic leader tours or visits normally do not exceed seven days. (See DODI 5410.19 for guidelines on community engagement activities.) PA staff often schedule open houses to coincide with Armed Forces Day, the Army Birthday, Service branch birthdays or anniversaries that mark the history of the installation, a unit, or community events, or in support of media day. An open house provides the local community an opportunity Public Communication )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 7-9 to interact with a military organization at the workplace or training site while informing the public of unit activities and the unit mission. Base Community Councils 7-46. PA staff liaise with the community through informal community engagement councils to establish and maintain open communications with community officials and organizations. Communities can give councils various responsibilities. These responsibilities can include developing and promoting new ways for members of the command to participate in local community activities, capitalizing on opportunities for better relations, and resolving potential and actual areas of conflict. Community liaison can also involve recognition of private citizens, local community leaders, and citizen groups and organizations for their support of the Army by public service awards. Commanders can further such measures through membership in civic, business, and professional organizations when the goals and objectives of those organizations benefit the Army and their programs and projects are consistent with Army interests. (See AR 360-1 and DODI 5410.19 for additional guidelines in conducting community engagement activities.) Military Band and Ceremonial Unit Performances 7-47. The band, color guard, and other ceremonial units participating in public events provide an effective way to accomplish community engagement objectives. These representatives of the Army serve as ambassadors to the civilian community and promote patriotism, interest in the Army, and awareness of Army professionalism. They play the National Anthem, post and retire the flags, demonstrate a professional image, and encourage participation with stimulating music. Town Halls 7-48. Town hall meetings provide installation commanders with an unfiltered means of communicating ideas to internal and external audiences. This tool for conveying important information and ideas about the command cannot be underestimated and should be carefully planned and executed. PAOs incorporate effectively using social media platforms to expand the reach of such events into the surrounding community. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT RESOURCES 7-49. When a community hosts an engagement and requests Army participation, PA staff help them request resources. The DOD recognizes two types of resources: those with aerial support and those without aerial support. 7-50. The Pentagon’s OCPA Outreach Division determines support eligibility and processes requests for all aerial events occurring in the civilian domain. The PA staff submit a DD Form 2535 (Request for Military Aerial Support) for all Army aviation requests to include aerial demonstrations, static displays, and demonstration by Army command parachute teams and by the Golden Knights. That same division forwards requests for non-aerial events to the appropriate local PA offices for consideration. The PA staff submit a DD Form 2536 (Request for Armed Forces Participation in Public Events [Non-Aviation]) for all non-aerial requests. These include color guards, band concerts, marching units, and troop displays. 7-51. PA staffs check the event criteria for Army support. They use the following criteria to determine eligibility for Army support: z Character and significance of the event. z Recruiting assets that will support the event with their projected benefit. z Expected attendance and media coverage. z All planned military participation, to include that by other Services. z Support will not interfere with official duties or detract from unit readiness or mission. z Specific benefits of support and impact if OCPA does not approve support. z Safety initiatives in place. In addition to the criteria, ongoing public concern and governmental budgetary constraints require the Army’s awareness of its shared role and a concerted effort by Army leaders to focus training resources on mission readiness. Army leaders make prudent decisions when assigning military assets to nonoperational Chapter 7 7-10 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ commitments. AR 360-1 outlines participation by Army personnel, their equipment, or both in public events in direct support of the core missions of the Army. All policies and procedures for approval of events are described under its provisions and remain in effect. PUBLIC AFFAIRS PRODUCTS 7-52. Effective PA operations involve creating and using various products to execute the commander’s communication priorities across the command information, public information, and community engagement programs. Additionally, numerous PA products help to guide the organization through the planning process. COMMAND INFORMATION 7-53. PA operations use publications and other materials to support command information programs. Publications such as printed newspapers and magazines are products that require additional resources and are typically less effective in today’s digital technological world. Commanders have the authority to establish funded newspapers when it meets two requirements. First, a valid command information mission requirement exists and second, the commander and the next higher level of command determine a newspaper as the most cost-effective means of fulfilling the command’s internal communication requirement. See DODI 5120.04 for instructions regarding the use of this PA product as a communication tool. Magazines, when approved by the ASCC, ACOM, or direct reporting units in accordance with AR 360-1, can effectively inform the internal audience while providing an additional outlet for articles and photography produced by PA professionals about unit activities. Commanders can print approved magazines using appropriated funds in accordance with DODI 5120.04. Normally, only one post publication (newspaper or magazine) is authorized at an installation, command, or community. (See AR 360-1 for printing authorizations.) 7-54. Occasionally, organizations ask PA staffs to produce additional materials (such as posters, pamphlets, and other printed material) to support the commander’s communications objectives with respect to the organization’s internal audience. PA staffs employ standard principles of design when creating such products and, when possible, leverage the assistance of trained graphic designers. RELEASABLE INFORMATION 7-55. PA operations use releasable information through means of visual information; releases, posts, and advisories; and other products to support command information programs. The PAO or PAO representative reviews information for accuracy and professionalism in keeping with the intended audience before submitting them to appropriate contacts. PA professionals follow Associated Press and local style guidelines when producing news releases and media advisories. (See DODI 5120.04 or DODI 5120.20 for more information.) Visual Information 7-56. PA operations use visual information to share public information. PAOs leverage all unit capabilities to tell the story of Soldier and unit activities through visual information consisting of multimedia products for radio, television, and online media. PA professionals follow the DOD Visual Information Style Guide for standardized guidance on writing captions and entering metadata associated with all DOD VI products. Official DOD imagery serves as an essential tool for decision makers at every level, and mission success and the protection of lives and property depend on official DOD imagery being complete, timely, and accurate. PA professionals must abide by well-established DOD policies related to the capturing, handling, and distribution of official imagery. (See the DOD Visual Information Style Guide at http://www.dimoc.mil/VI- Training/DOD-VI-Style-Guide/. See table 7-1 for stipulations.) Public Communication )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 7-11 Table 7-1. Imagery stipulations Type Stipulation Source VIRIN Visual Identification (VI) Record Identification Number Strategic, operational, tactical, and joint-interest imagery be centrally received, managed, and distributed as a shared asset. All such imagery shall be assigned a VIRIN. DODI 5040.02 Enclosure 6 Vision ID Visual Information Professional Identifier All photographers, videographers, graphic artists, photojournalists, broadcasters, public affairs and other personnel involved in the creation of official DOD imagery shall be assigned a Vision ID. DODI 5040.02 Enclosure 7 Alteration Official DOD imagery shall not be altered except for specified corrections, modifications, and enhancements. DODI 5040.02 Enclosure 10 DVIAN Defense Visual Information Activity Number A five-character unique identifier in alpha (A) numeric (N) format, rendered as (ANNNN), assigned to approved VI activities (such as public affairs offices, public affairs detachments and support elements, combat camera units, ships, and other major commands) to validate their authority to operate and to enable unit-level attribution of VI records. Like the Vision ID, the DVIAN resides in Field 3 of the VIRIN. DODI 5040.02 Enclosure 8 Distribution All publically released imagery shall be expeditiously forwarded to the Defense Imagery Management Operations Center (DIMOC) through the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS). DVIDS serves as the single central ingestion point for all DOD cleared and released imagery. As such, DVIDS provides the military, media outlets, and the general public with access to a searchable repository of official DOD audio-visual and still imagery. DODI 5040.02 Enclosure 5 DOD Department of Defense DODI Department of Defense instruction Releases, Posts, and Advisories 7-57. PA operations use releases, posts, and advisories to share public information. PA professionals issue news releases, social media posts, and media advisories regularly to inform the public of appropriate unit activities. The PAO reviews these releases for accuracy and professionalism and submits them to appropriate contacts. PA staffs use proper grammar when producing news releases and media advisories. Other Products 7-58. PA operations use other products to share public information. To inform an external audience properly, PA staffs create various products for public release. Staffs prepare backgrounders or fact sheets, for example, as appropriate to provide detail about a detailed or complicated subject. Such products often accompany a news release to give amplifying or background information on a particular subject for greater context. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT 7-59. PA operations use command engagements to support command information programs. PA staffs engage writing speeches, penning editorials, and posting on social media platforms. Speeches 7-60. Speeches prove an effective tool of a commander’s community engagement program. Speaking engagements in the community are critical to maintaining public awareness and support for the Army. PAOs can establish a speaker’s bureau to identify qualified individuals in an organization to speak to the public. AR 360-1 mandates a speaker’s bureau down to the installation level. This bureau prepares selected individuals to present speeches. The PA office establishes local clearance procedures for planned speeches. (See AR 360-1 for PA and speaker’s bureau.) Chapter 7 7-12 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ Editorials 7-61. Commanders can use editorials to engage the community. An editorial written for a commander’s community engagement publication or a local community newspaper provides the commander an opportunity to discuss policies or address issues. Commanders can voice arguments for or against such issues. Editorials are opinion-based and persuasive in nature. An effective PAO advises the commander when an editorial is the appropriate tool to inform the public. When working with a national, regional, or local newspaper, PA professionals follow the editorial standards of the paper in terms of length, submission instructions, and other requirements. Social Media Platforms 7-62. Unit social media provide the commander the opportunity to engage various audiences in a public forum with immediacy. An effective PAO advises commanders on what conditions they need to engage the public. (For more on social media, see Chapter 9.) DISTRIBUTION OF COMMAND INFORMATION 7-63. PA must analyze all available mediums to succeed in telling the Army story. PA personnel should be ready to serve and take advantage of various media, both locally and at the state, national, or international levels. In conducting market analysis, the following advantages and disadvantages of the various types of media in carrying the desired message must be considered. NEWSPAPERS 7-64. Newspapers are able to cover stories in greater depth. They are timelier than magazines or books, but not as timely as radio, TV, or digital media. However, newspapers are more permanent than radio or TV. Daily and weekly newspapers often attract habitual readers. RADIO 7-65.Radios are sometimes the only means of communications to the public during hostilities. Its major disadvantages are its lack of visual appeal, its lack of permanence and its lack of depth, as most radio news stories are in the 20–30 second range. TELEVISION 7-66. Television is the most widely-used platform and the medium of choice for news in America. Its disadvantages, like radio, are its lack of permanence and its lack of depth. Another disadvantage is that younger audiences are twice more likely to use digital media for news gathering than TV. NEWS SERVICES 7-67. News services can help get a story with national or international appeal to the widest possible public. News services or wire services exist to provide the mass media with coverage local media could not afford. In effect, subscription to a news service (print, electronic, or both) gives a subscriber correspondents wherever the news service has a bureau. PUBLICATIONS 7-68. Publications can be grouped as news (Time, Newsweek), consumer (TV Guide, Better Homes and Gardens), special interest (Stereo Review, Soldier of Fortune), and internal (Soldiers, Armor). Few publication editors want “handouts” except as possible leads for staff-written stories. Special interest publications are the exception. Many eagerly seek high-quality stories and photos. Public Communication )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 7-13 DIGITAL MEDIA 7-69. Digital media is the most potent mass communication medium today. It offers variety, mobility, and combines TV’s impact of moving pictures with the sound and immediacy of radio. Digital media is also a world-reaching medium that is accessed on a moment-to-moment basis by all types of publics. Many of the previous mediums have an outlet to the internet providing possible permanence and history for stories and information. Developing a digital media presence can often be beneficial to your unit’s command information mission. 7-70. Reviewing available media, the PAO should compile a media listing. That listing should include all local media and outside media that would likely use material from the U.S. Army as well as names of editors, news directors, or station managers; addresses; phone numbers; deadlines; frequency of publication; type of public served; and unique requirements or interests. In many communities, media listings already exist and are available from state, city, or community service organizations. The Gebbie Press All-In-One Directory, the Editor and Publisher International Yearbook, and Broadcasting Annual are examples of directories that can help locate outlets nationally and worldwide. 7-71. As part of marketing, press releases and media advisories will routinely be issued. These releases must be reviewed and approved by the PAO or his or her designee. Before sending a release to any media, ensure it is accurate, professionally prepared, and of interest to the newspaper, magazine, or radio-TV stations receiving it. Also ensure releases are tailored to suit the requirements, interests, and formats of the recipients. PUBLIC AFFAIRS REGULATIONS, LAWS, AND POLICIES 7-72. Numerous regulations, laws, and policies guide the application of effective PA operations. PA professionals must be familiar with such guidance to manage daily PA operations properly and advise the commander. The following paragraphs discuss a few basic PA publications while highlighting various important regulations, laws, and policies that inform PA conduct. ARMY REGULATION 7-73. AR 360-1 provides guidelines for the release of command and public information, including information released to the media, and community engagement programs intended for internal and external audiences with interest in the U.S. Army. PA professionals should be familiar with the guidance within AR 360-1 when planning and executing command information, community engagement, and public information programs in garrison or while deployed. JOINT DOCTRINE 7-74. JP 3-61 provides doctrine for the planning, execution, and assessment of PA activities in joint operations. It includes the Army fundamentals, roles, responsibilities, and relationships to joint functions and capabilities. Successful PA professionals understand and apply JP 3-61 when operating in joint and deployed environments. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ISSUANCES 7-75. Effective PA professionals know DOD-level guidance on PA operations, including the following: z DODD 5122.05 establishes the responsibilities and functions, relationships, and authorities of the ATSD (PA). z DODI 5400.13 establishes policy and assigns responsibilities for the conduct of PA as a primary DOD communications capability. z DODI 5400.14 implements policy, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for the conduct of PA programs in support of joint, combined, and unilateral military operations. z DODI 5410.19 establishes policy for the conduct of PA community relations activities and programs throughout DOD. Chapter 7 7-14 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ REGULATIONS, LAWS, AND POLICIES 7-76. Military programs are governed by federal law, DOD policies, and branch-specific regulations. Free Flow of Information 7-77. DODD 5122.05 mandates that military organizations make available timely and accurate information so that the public, Congress, and the news media may assess and understand facts about national security and defense strategy. In carrying out the policy, the principles of information will apply. (See DODD 5122.05 for a description of the DOD principles of information.) In keeping with this policy, PA staff answers requests for information from organizations and private citizens in a timely manner in accordance with the FOIA. According to DODD 5400.07, Congress enacted FOIA to protect the American people from the government unnecessarily withholding information from them. PAOs must be familiar enough with FOIA to understand the basics of the law and to abide by its implications regarding the proper release of information. (See DODD 5400.07 for guidelines on the FOIA and the nine exemptions allowed under law.) Law of War and Rules of Engagement 7-78. The law of war is that part of international law that regulates the conduct of armed force (JP 3-84). The law of war also applies to the conduct of hostilities and the protection of war victims in both international and non-international armed conflict, belligerent occupation, and the relationships among belligerent, neutral, and non-belligerent States. Rules of engagement are directives issued by competent military authority that delineate the circumstances and limitations under which United States forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other forces encountered (JP 3-84). Rules of engagement reflect legal, policy, and operational considerations; they are consistent with the international law obligations of the United States, including the law of war. When communicating in a deployed environment, PA professionals must understand the law of war and the rules of engagement as well as their implications on U.S. military operations. (See Department of Defense Law of War Manual for additional guidelines.) Host-Nation Laws 7-79. All PA staff members use host-nation laws to inform communications. PA planners consult with host- nation governments as appropriate in deployed environments. These planners identify local issues and concerns that they reflect in the PAG released to the commander and in externally released PA products. For more guidance, PA staff contact the respective host nation’s embassy PAO. Privacy Act 7-80. The Privacy Act of 1974 establishes that an individual’s privacy is a fundamental legal right. AR 25-22 generally prohibits the members of the Army from publicly releasing certain items of information about an individual without that individual’s consent. (See AR 360-1 for implementing privacy rights.) DODI 5400.11 mandates the protection of individual’s rights, consistent with federal laws, regulations, and policies when maintaining their personally identifiable information. PA professionals must protect the privacy rights of Service members while providing publics with appropriate information about unit activities. In accordance with DODI 1300.18, PA offices cannot release casualty information on deceased personnel to the media or general public until 24 hours after notifying the next of kin regarding the casualty status of the member. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 7-81. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (known as HIPAA) of 1996, implemented by DODI 6025.18 and DODI 8580.02, generally prohibits the DA from publicly releasing certain items of information about an individual without that individual’s consent. To release information about patients under treatment in Army medical facilities, PA professionals must obtain prior consent from the individual or the individual’s representative. (See AR 360-1 for additional guidelines on what information in releasable once consent is obtained.) Public Communication )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 7-15 Security Review 7-82. All official information released to the public that pertains to military matters, national security issues, or subjects of significant concern to the DOD must receive a security review by a qualified PA professional. That PA professional ensures that such information does not violate OPSEC. DOD personnel have the responsibility to ensure products have a proper security review before distributing them to the public. This applies to written products, speeches, and information released on the internet or other electronic media. Additional training and guidance is available at the Army Social Media website. (See DODI 5230.29 for additional guidelines on clearance and review of DOD information for public release.) Accessibility 7-83. PA professionals ensure persons with disabilities can appropriately access PA products (See DODM 8400.01 for guidance on accessibility for persons with disabilities.) DODM 8400.01 addresses DOD employees or members of the public with disabilities who seek information or services from the DOD. This regulation requires PA staff to give these people access to and use of information and data comparable to the access and use by individuals without disabilities. If such access imposes an undue burden on PA staff, then the staff can limit the accessibility. (See specific details in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as codified in Section 794d of Title 29, USC.)

Disinformation, often characterized as propaganda, is any form of adversary communication, especially of a biased or misleading nature, designed to influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, or behavior of any group in order to benefit the sponsor, either directly or indirectly. The traditional factors that make information about an event newsworthy are the same factors that make propaganda compelling. People are drawn to conflict or violence, and many of our adversaries have mastered the art of using it, real and contrived, to influence the audience to further their objectives and minimize the Army’s effectiveness. Anticipating actions that an adversary may exploit with propaganda and limiting that potential with preemptive release of information is paramount. When operations do not allow for such actions, PA units prepare to respond quickly to counter propaganda. DEFINITION 8-2. Misinformation is a subset of information defined simply as incorrect information. Incorrect information from any source that is disseminated through ignorance or with the belief that the incorrect information is correct, can be a result of an adversarial disinformation campaign. Information can be incorrect for numerous reasons. For the purpose of PA, incorrect information has the potential to affect the understanding that a public may have on a subject important to communication efforts. 8-3. Disinformation is incorrect or false information disseminated from an adversarial source that is designed with the intent to distort information or deceive or influence the receiver. Adversarial use of disinformation in the information environment is often to confuse or affect public opinion against a perceived enemy and benefit the sponsor of the disinformation. Some forms of adversarial disinformation are deliberately disseminated in order to benefit a sponsoring government, organization, or group, either directly or indirectly. Intelligence organizations or other covert adversaries use indirect or unconventional means to distort information to deceive or influence publics. PA staff should not expect to defeat disinformation since it is a tactic and not an adversary, but should expect to be part of the countermeasure process. PA can counter disinformation and should acknowledge the strength truth has over both disinformation and misinformation. PUBLIC AFFAIRS REQUIREMENT 8-4. DODI 5400.13 drives the PA activities requirement. It instructs PA staffs develop and employ DOD PA activities and capabilities to support the command and to ensure the trust and confidence of U.S.
population, friends and allies, deter and dissuade adversaries, and counter misinformation and disinformation ensuring effective, culturally appropriate information delivery in regional languages. PUBLIC AFFAIRS CONSIDERATIONS 8-5. PA staffs have several factors to consider when assessing adversarial misinformation and disinformation. They first consider what makes the disinformation believable. Misinformation is not adversarial, though adversaries can have misinformation efforts as part of a disinformation campaign. The most successful conspiracies likely contain some element of truth. The traditional factors that make information about an event newsworthy are the same factors that make misinformation compelling. Publics have both concern and interest regarding conflict or violence, and the Army’s adversaries have mastered the art of using it, real and contrived, to influence audiences, further their objectives, and minimize the command’s effectiveness. Chapter 8 8-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ 8-6. Second, PA staff consider the unity of effort necessary to counter disinformation. When coordinating IRCs, PA personnel ensure unity of effort in countering disinformation. Commanders consistently communicate in an integrated and coherent manner regarding the actions and intentions of the Army and their command to counter disinformation. 8-7. Speed is a third consideration when countering misinformation and disinformation. The first side that presents the information sets the context and frames the public debate. PA staffs work quickly to get accurate information and imagery out first, without rushing to failure by inadvertently releasing inaccurate or incomplete information—even information that portrays DOD in a negative manner. This speed helps disarm the adversary’s propaganda and defeats attempts by the adversary to use these mistakes against friendly forces. Credibility must be maintained. PA professionals require the knowledge, skills, resources, capabilities, and authority to release information rapidly to various publics to support the commander’s communication strategy effectively. PA disseminates information while protecting OPSEC and in accordance with DOD policy and guidance. 8-8. Lastly, PA professionals consider where to search for the adversary’s information. They analyze information in traditional, nontraditional, and social media channels in search of misinformation about the Army and its missions. Misinformation can adversely affect an operational environment and the success of operations. PA operations contribute positively to operational environments by delivering facts in the form of releasable accurate information and imagery. PA staffs recognize and pick out adversarial disinformation efforts to analyze and counter before it can negatively affect Army operations. RECOGNIZING MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION 8-9. Detecting and recognizing misinformation and disinformation proves challenging for PA personnel. Misinformation and disinformation resides in the same outlets as factual, truthful information. Adversaries understand this and often rely on the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated information using the continuous news cycle, social and digital media platforms, and other online information sources. 8-10. PA staff audits continuously for misinformation and disinformation regardless of the environment or type of military operation. PA staff conducts communication analysis and evaluation of PA activities. Army PA staff research to detect and counter or mitigate mission-related disinformation directed at international, national, and local publics, both at home station and abroad. Knowing where to search and being able to identify the types and tactics of misinformation and disinformation is critical to counter an adversary’s malign narrative. RESOURCES 8-11. To recognize misinformation and disinformation, PA staff require various resources. They need access to information, current technology, and IRCs. Detecting misinformation counter to planned and coordinated communication is the first step to successfully counter disinformation and correct misinformation. The commander, through coordinated communication, ensures PA staff have access to information that affects an operational area. This information can include open source reports, relevant intelligence, and known common adversary disinformation techniques.8-12. With support from PA staff, the commander leverages available technology and personnel to detect, analyze, and respond to misinformation and disinformation. This technology gives PA staff real-time awareness of facts surrounding military operations by publics, stakeholders, and even adversaries Technology that includes social media and broadcasting enables PA personnel to establish and own the narrative among publics and the media. An uncorrected record provides an adversary with a great deal of time to amplify the effects of false or misleading information. 8-13. Involvement in the planning process and having access to various IRCs help PA staff to detect, analyze, and decide when to release timely, truthful information and imagery intended to counter misinformation and disinformation efforts. PA staff should, at a minimum, maintain knowledge and awareness of the following resources: z Annex J (Public Affairs) in the operation order. z Appendix 1 (Public Affairs Running Estimate) to Annex J (Public Affairs) in the operation order. Counter Misinformation and Disinformation )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 8-3 z Communication plans. z PAG. z Media analysis products. z Social media engagement. z Media engagements. z Higher headquarters’ communication plans. z Themes and messages to include changes from higher headquarters. z Communication from leadership. z SOPs. z Intelligence products. z Open source reports. DISINFORMATION TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES 8-14. To recognize misinformation and disinformation, PA staff require disinformation tactics and techniques. Adversaries employ various tactics and techniques in their disinformation efforts. PA staff leverage the knowledge of other IRCs to gain a greater understanding and increase their ability to recognize disinformation. Tactics 8-15. PA staffs study and understand several disinformation tactics: z Forgeries. z Front groups and friendship societies. z Influence operations. z Media manipulation. z Broadcasts. Forgeries 8-16. The first misinformation and disinformation tactic recognized by PA personnel is forgeries. Forgeries, to include falsified documents and imagery, attempt to discredit individuals, institutions, or policies so to damage the Army and its interests as well as manipulate public and government opinions. PA staffs can expose forgeries as fakes, However, such denial may never entirely offset the initial damage, which allows for repeated references to the document. 8-17. The effectiveness of a forgery often depends more on the predisposition of the recipient than on the source or quality of the forgery. A recipient who is hostile toward the Army or U.S. Government or who is eager to expose an individual or organization they have contempt for is far more likely to credit a forgery than one who is not hostile. Sophisticated journalists usually prevent publication of the forgery, and a forged document is more likely to circulate in nontraditional media or on social media platforms. Front Groups and Friendship Societies 8-18. PA personnel recognize the tactic of front groups and friendship societies. Front groups and friendship societies normally present themselves as nongovernmental, nonpolitical organizations engaged in promoting such desirable goals as world peace, cultural understanding, philanthropy, and education. Front groups can provide an adversary with a covert vantage point from which to disseminate disinformation by providing sensational commentary to the media, provocative imagery, and persuasive funding all in the effort to influence the narrative. PA personnel recognize that fronts are an intelligence function, which falls into the realm of human intelligence and outside of PA. Influence Operations 8-19. Another tactic that adversaries use is called influence operations. Influence operations involve individuals who openly or covertly support and promote their sponsor’s interests. These individuals of Chapter 8 8-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ influence may come from virtually any profession. Sometimes adversaries wait until an individual achieves an influential position in government, business, academia, or media before they call on the individual to be a representative for disinformation. PA staffs recognize an influence operation is an intelligence function, particularly when looking at an individual and building a profile on them. This must be avoided by PA staff. Media Manipulation 8-20. PA staffs recognize the misinformation and disinformation tactic called media manipulation. Media manipulation occurs when adversaries of the Army or U.S. Government place falsely attributed or non- attributed disinformation products in print, broadcast, and social media. These products, which contain misinformation, may appear in regular publications, clandestine broadcasts, or printed brochures. Broadcasts transmit through radio, television, and social media to provide misinformation to various publics. Some broadcasts are clandestine. Overt broadcasts are active in numerous nations that promote disinformation that opposes the Army’s interests. PA staff recognize broadcasts of misinformation or disinformation by the manipulator committing gross negligence of facts and errors in fact. Techniques 8-21. PA staffs study and understand several disinformation techniques used by adversaries. They have no exact formula for detecting if some specific information or allegation is false. However, they can answer certain questions to determine the credibility of the information. 8-22. PA staffs can ask if a covert but influential organization is responsible for a circumstance or event. Does the information contain fantastic claims? Does it identify powerful or destructive organizations or forces that are secretly controlling people or manipulating world events? If so, the information may be a conspiracy theory. Conspiracy theories are rarely true, but are often widely accepted and have appeal. Adversaries often target the U.S. military or intelligence community in conspiracy theories. 8-23. Another technique that PA staffs recognize involves a story circulating as truth that happened to an acquaintance with horrifying elements. Is the story startling, entertaining, bad, amazing, horrifying, or otherwise seemingly too good or too terrible to be true? If so, it may be an urban legend. Urban legends often circulate by word of mouth, email, or the internet. These stories involve false claims that an audience widely believe because they put a common fear, hope, suspicion, or other powerful emotion into story form. 8-24. PA staffs recognize a third technique that involves a shocking revelation. Does the information contain a shocking revelation about a highly controversial issue? Highly controversial issues are natural candidates for the rise of false rumors, unwarranted fears, and suspicions. The 2015 iteration of Jade Helm, the U.S.
Special Operations Command exercise, is one such example. Exercise planning documents fictionally depicting certain states in the southwest United States as hostile territory leaked to the public causing the proliferation of unsubstantiated governmental conspiracy theories and garnering national attention. By the time PA personnel got involved, the issue had become a crisis. Several stakeholder organizations and PA staffs diligently worked to mitigate the effects caused by the misinformation. 8-25. PA staffs recognize the technique of using an untrustworthy source. Is the source trustworthy? Certain websites, publications, and individuals have a reputation for spreading false stories. Many websites contain a great deal of unreliable information. Extremist groups, splinter political organizations, and individuals often publish disinformation. Titles of websites can also be deceiving and can present what appear to be official or harmless descriptions to lure viewers. PA staffs look carefully at website details to determine its ownership and validity of source information. This can prove especially difficult if front groups publish false allegations. Front groups purport to be independent, nonpartisan organizations, but actually partisan political parties or interest groups often control the websites. 8-26. Lastly, PA staffs recognize and perform quality research. What does further research tell you? They research allegations. They determine whether information is true or false by researching it thoroughly. PA staffs consider time, lethality, and pressure of a prompt response or release, but there is no substitute for thorough research. These staffs can thoroughly research information using the internet, communication plans, PAG, and other resources. Counter Misinformation and Disinformation )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 8-5 COUNTERING MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION 8-27. MISO help PA personnel to counter adversary information efforts of misinformation and disinformation. PA staffs work to decrease or mitigate the impact of information with timely, factual messages disseminated to selected target audiences to gain and maintain the information initiative. When PA staffs counter misinformation and disinformation, often while coordinating with other IRCs, they degrade the intended effects of misinformation and disinformation. The timely and accurate dissemination of truthful and verifiable information from credible sources exposes the misinformation. Eventually, synchronized communication can lessen or neutralize the credibility of intentional misinformation and disinformation sources. PA staffs—coordinating with other IRCs—accurately assess the information environment to determine the actual effectiveness versus the perceived effectiveness. 8-28. These staff use the following resources to counter misinformation and disinformation: z Timeliness and deterrence. z Synchronization with IRCs. z Lines of effort relationships z Communication. z Various timeframes. TIMELINESS AND DETERRENCE 8-29. PA personnel use timeliness and deterrence to counter adversary misinformation and disinformation efforts. Army PA personnel have an obligation to keep the American people and Army forces informed, which includes countering misinformation and disinformation directed at those publics. Adversaries can include individuals, organizations, nations, and non-nation state players attempting to influence publics with false or misleading communication. 8-30. An adversary understands that timeliness of disinformation is important in communicating to achieve influence. PA personnel cannot assume positive perceptions and attitudes from leaders, decision makers, and the public. The entity that establishes the narrative first can more easily sway perceptions and attitudes. 8-31. Effective commanders prepare to assume some risk to ensure timely execution of public communication activities. Such activities make available the most contextually accurate information to the public. If commanders hesitate to release information or acknowledge events until after they gather complete facts and circumstances, they can create a void in the disseminated information. An effective adversary can potentially fill that void with disinformation.

Digital media is text, audio, and VI content that can be transmitted over the internet or computer networks. Army PA content that is released on a website, blog, or social media platform will fall into this category (AR 360-1). Digital media management is the process of communicating information across the command enterprise using an organization’s digital tools—including unit websites, CORE, and social media platforms—to build an engaging online presence. Successful digital media management incorporates a digital media strategy. This strategy defines communication objectives and designs plans that leverage the appropriate digital platforms to inform, educate, and engage audiences in support of the commander’s communication strategy. A digital media strategy, and the overall digital media management process, takes time and dedicated resources to develop and execute. 9-2. Digital media management aligns the commander’s objectives in support of DOD strategic narratives across the entire command enterprise. Generally, garrison commands and echelons at division level and above implement a digital media strategy. PA personnel develop both long-term digital media strategies for commands and event-based strategies in pursuit of singular goals or topics. PAOs balance digital media management—either at the enterprise level or in support of the higher echelon—with daily social media maintenance. 9-3. Social media maintenance is the art of maintaining a dynamic and engaging social presence. It focuses mainly on daily social engagements at the organizational level and in support of higher echelon’s digital media strategies. PA staffs maintain social media by systematically performing recurring tasks that lead to creating and posting various types of content. Social media maintenance has no defined start or finish. A digital media strategy has a defined goal or goals with measurable outcomes—or return-on-investment—that supports the commander’s intent. PA personnel assess digital media strategies by the successful or unsuccessful completion of defined goals. To complete these goals, PA staffs ensure strategies have defined timelines, allocate resources deliberately, and digitally integrate the command enterprise. 9-4. In the development process, PA personnel consider ways that digital media strategies support or complement larger Army initiatives. PA personnel factor the tie-in to the Army’s organizational values and commander’s vision. Effective digital media strategies define a purpose and an outcome. Rather than technology centric, digital media management is relationship centric (two-way communication), which requires consistent follow up with audience engagement and synchronization within the command. COMPONENTS OF A DIGITAL MEDIA STRATEGY 9-5. PA staffs develop a digital engagement strategy with a defined goal or objective if the topic or goal is of great enough importance or has command emphasis. The goal is a one-sentence statement to solve a core problem or seize an opportunity. Often this sentence states the desired outcome to meet a challenge. The statement does not have to be in quantifiable terms. For example, the strategy could be “Decrease the number of drivers stopped for driving under the influence or DUI.” The goal of a digital media strategy is typically a broad one. PA staffs tailor the strategy to changing knowledge, attitudes, or behavior. It simply answers the question: What do we want to happen? To develop the strategy, PA staffs perform eight tasks. Chapter 9 9-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ RESEARCH BACKGROUND 9-6. Once PA staffs identify a goal for a digital media strategy, they conduct background research on the topic. When conducting background research, they consider three types of research: primary, secondary, and general topic. 9-7. Primary research is information gathered firsthand by the PA staff member with social media management tasks. A social media manager is a PA member who has completed OPSEC Level II and has received all necessary training to publish on social media on behalf of the commander and the unit. PA staffs can collect information in many forms including surveys, focus groups, and personal interviews or studying trends on the unit’s social media sites. 9-8. Secondary research is conducted by using pre-existing research found in online databases. This can include scholarly journals, census, and newspapers as well as demographic information found in studies conducted by the base safety office. 9-9. At a minimum, PA Soldiers conduct general topic research in support of communication goals. For example, the commander may have a goal to decrease the number of DUIs. In this case, Soldiers research the number of DUIs in the command during a specified period, hours of work lost due to DUI infractions, financial impacts on Soldiers, career impacts on Soldiers, applicable regulations, and Army guidance. Such extensive research is essential to developing a coherent strategy. When planning to conduct research, PA staffs consider: z Time constraints. z Personnel available to conduct the research. z Commander’s intent (speed at which PA staffs must post the topic or content). z Knowledge about the topic. z Existing information about the topic. z Legal issues (when the topic concerns legal or law issues). CONDUCT ANALYSIS OF BACKGROUND RESEARCH 9-10. Once PA staffs gather all necessary background research, they analyze the research. The analysis should include assessments of social media trends, audiences, and agendas. It should also include identifying gaps in knowledge or capabilities as well as identifying available and emerging platforms, formats, and best practices. Some analysis will include determining the current social media climate. Effective analysis involves analyzing narratives, counter-narratives, other communication trends and tactics, techniques, and procedures. Analyzing the background research also includes selecting tactics, techniques, and procedures from the analysis in support of social media strategy. Lastly, this analysis includes forecasting future effects of current conversations, engagements, and trends. When PA staffs conduct background research, they also perform a digital media audit. CONDUCT DIGITAL MEDIA AUDIT 9-11. During a digital media audit, PA staffs focus on the organization’s internal products as well as external social media platforms. The audit can be a general audit, or specific to the goal of the digital media strategy. An internal audit focuses on organizational communication tools and determines those tools that already support the goal. Some examples of products to review include the following: z Organization social media platforms. z Command information products. z Official emails. z Press releases. z All other communication products. An external audit focuses on other organizations’ methods to reach the particular goal of the digital media strategy. An external audit can include other Army organizations as well as external organizations.For example, Mothers Against Drunk Driving has a social media presence that addresses the DUI topic. Digital Media Management and Social Media Maintenance )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 9-3 9-12. Part of auditing digital media includes looking at existing communication tools. Some communication tools might already focus on reaching a specific audience. For example, PA staffs might use social media to reach external audiences and use emails to reach internal audiences. PA staffs identify which communication tool best reaches which audience. The resulting information helps PA staffs determine the best engagement plan in support of the social media strategy. For each social media platform, they answer the following questions: z Who (what audience) is using the platform? z How many people follow the communication platform? z What are the demographics of the audience for each platform? z How is each platform currently being used? z What key messages are currently used on each platform? (This can help shape messaging later in the plan.) z Is the tone usually serious or light-hearted? (Sudden jokes on a serious platform may damage the message being transmitted.) z What other stakeholders have interest or are related to the topic? z What messages are other stakeholders posting about the topic? 9-13. If surveys, analytics, or anecdotal data indicate most users of a particular social media platform are outside the internal audience, a different platform may work better to reach the internal audience. The opposite can be applied to email when trying to reach an external audience. If a particular social media site only has a few followers, PA staffs may not find it useful to use unless the followers are a key audience. Ideally, PA staffs organize the results of a social media audit into a table. DEFINE OBJECTIVES 9-14. Objectives aim to align efforts, increase transparency, and develop manageable, adaptable, and measureable courses of actions in support of a digital media strategy. PA staffs do not define objectives to identify shortcomings, but more to look at the factors that contributed towards success or failure. While developing objectives, PA staffs annotate the objective, its alignment or support for a competency, and its metric or key result. Most goals have three supporting objectives. The best-formulated objectives result as measurable outcomes. There are often multiple objectives in support of a single goal. DEFINE KEY RESULTS 9-15. A key result is a milestone. Objectives are directional and tell organizations where to go. PA staffs use key results to measure whether or not the organization achieves the objective. Effective PA staffs organize objectives and key results using a table. They follow these guidelines when developing key results in support of objectives: z Clear key results to make the objective achievable. z Quantifiable key results they tie to a number. z Maximum of 4 key results per objective so they are measurable. DETERMINE KEY AUDIENCE 9-16. After PA staffs define objectives and key results, staffs use the background research and analysis to determine the key audience. First, PA staffs consider the following demographic categories when developing audience segments for the social media strategy: z Age. z Gender. z Affiliation (military—enlisted, officer, and other Service), civilian, family members, retirees, and contractors. z Location. z Marital status. z Audience core values. Chapter 9 9-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ 9-17. Beyond demographics, PA staffs can benefit from developing personas and identifying affinities of the intended audience. Personas, which have roots in marketing, are research-based archetypal (modeled) representations of who audiences are, what they are trying to accomplish, and what goals drive their behavior, how they think, how they buy, and why they make buying decisions. Affinities are lifestyle interests of personas and their preferences for certain products or services, respectively. Development of personas provides information necessary so that PA staffs can select an applicable social media platform. 9-18. After PA staffs identify the affinities of the intended audience, they select audience segments. These groups of people need to be informed to support the social media strategy and must be reached to achieve the goal and objectives. PA staffs identify several elements for each segment. These include demographics, behaviors, self-interests, attitudes, values, and media habits. PA staffs determine audience segments during the research section of the digital media strategy to create personas. 9-19. Lastly, PA staffs create the content calendar and implementing strategy. Content is king. Once PA staffs identify the audiences, digital media platforms, and social media platforms, they create a content calendar. The content calendar identifies the type of communication product PA staffs will use, the associated text, and the social media platform. A table or spreadsheet can display the following content calendar tasks: z Develop digital engagement strategy to deliver messages to personas (the tools and platforms used to engage each persona). z Create a timeline. z Select best available platform to engage appropriate audience. z Identify content to deliver organizational messages. z Compose social media posts for each platform. z Assign release schedule to support overall objectives. Note. Completion of the content calendar results in the template to implement the digital media strategy. Even if not implementing a strategy, a content calendar by itself is a useful tool for social media maintenance. ASSESS DIGITAL MEDIA STRATEGY OBJECTIVES 9-20. Once PA personnel implement the digital media strategy, they begin tracking effectiveness and assessing for achievement of objectives. Numerous tools exist to conduct assessments on government and social platforms. Government platforms include websites such as Digital Analytics Program (DAP), USASearch, and Go.USA. Social platforms discuss social media insights and analytics organic to social platforms. When assessing key results, PA personnel consider ways the results support the defined objectives. If PA staffs used surveys or focus groups, they conduct a follow-up measurement. When assessing social media outreach, PA staffs evaluate both qualitative and quantitative measurements. Qualitative data can be observed and recorded whereas quantitative data can be assembled numerically. Qualitative results include anecdotal responses and message penetration as measured from key results, knowledge, attitude, behavior assessments, and surveys. Quantitative results include statics and percentages that involve the number of reaches, impressions, social media likes, shares, retweets, net change in followers, and number of direct engagements. COORDINATE DISTRIBUTION 9-21. Effective distribution of content is key to a successful digital media strategy. An effective strategy called the hub and spoke method achieves a “dandelion” effect. (See figure 9-1 for a sample of this effect.) With this method, multiple units can act autonomously, but are guided by the priorities of and are synchronized with the U.S. Army brand enterprise. PA staffs achieve an optimal “dandelion” effect by coordinating up and down the enterprise at echelon. This coordination ensures sharing and cross-promotion of content. When PA staffs coordinate distribution properly, they maximize the amplification potential of content across key audiences. Digital Media Management and Social Media Maintenance )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 9-5 Figure 9-1. Example of the dandelion effect of distribution coordination SOCIAL MEDIA MAINTENANCE 9-22. Social media assists in the telling of the Army’s story. More than ever before, social media is now almost unavoidable in our daily lives. PA personnel use it as a primary communication channel to engage the public and the media. The Army encourages commands, Soldiers, Families, and DA Civilians to use social media safely and accurately to share their experiences and provide information. Commanders and PA professionals understand that social media represents a shift in the way Americans have traditionally communicated. Internet-based platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat provide new ways to connect, interact, and learn. Perceptions can be as powerful as the truth within social media. The Internet moves good and bad information quickly. Social media platforms instantaneously connect users with a global network, making the transfer of information even more pervasive. This highly effective tool reaches large communities and audiences. 9-23. Social media is a global and cultural phenomenon, and for many Americans it has become a part of their daily activities. Social media allows Soldiers to tell their story in an authentic and intimate manner, and is the integral piece of any digital media strategy. By interacting with Soldiers, Family members, DA Civilians, and the public on social media platforms, the Army gives its audience increased confidence in and an environment for trusted information. Social media, as part of a commander’s communication strategy, helps fulfill the commander’s obligation to communicate with all stakeholders. It also provides another, often Chapter 9 9-6 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ richer, means of sharing information with internal and external audiences. Stakeholders increasingly use social media, which requires a digital media strategy to meet these stakeholders where they are. CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE 9-24. Social media broadly describes various digital communication platforms that allow for social networking. Social media connects people using digital communication technologies to share information and engage in conversations on topics of mutual interest. While specific mediums, platforms, and technologies may change in time, the overall trend of people connecting with other people using technology only increases. Social media is a powerful communications tool. When used correctly, social media can help an organization reach a much larger audience. Social media can help organizations engage in the conversation while promoting awareness of the organization’s main communication priorities. However, not all Army organizations use social media effectively. Sub-optimization of social media often occur when organizations rush into social media before determining what it aims to achieve with social media platforms. Using social media effectively is a process and requires a digital media strategy, goals, manpower, and foresight. ESTABLISHING A SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE 9-25. A social media presence extends beyond simply having social media accounts. It includes how the organization uses the accounts are and how often they engage audiences. Most Army organizations use social media for online engagements in garrison and operational areas. Developing a successful social media presence does not happen overnight. It is a detailed process that requires extensive planning and execution. When establishing a new social media presence, PA professionals should— z Get command approval. (See Approval of External Presences in AR 360-1). z Review official social media policies, guidelines, resources, and training. (See the Army SlideShare website for presentations that discuss social media topics.) z Determine your audience. PA staffs identify the intended audience and research their social media habits. Stakeholders, politicians, community leaders, criminals, imposters, and even adversaries or enemies are also watching. z Determine staffing. PA staffs ensure appropriate staffing and resources (personnel, equipment, and connectivity) exist to meet the requirements needed to maintain the platform. They identify primary and alternate PA personnel with social media management tasks as well as identify procedures to transfer established duties. z Research and select social media platforms. PA staffs determine whether efficiently and effectively maintaining and managing a social media account is possible. An audience’s demographic determines what platforms work best to reach it. A person’s age, occupation, military affiliation, nationality, and education influence the platforms that person visits. z Select your name and branding. PA staffs use a logical and easily remembered name that avoids nicknames, call signs, acronyms, or mottos. They include the official U.S. Army logo and other branded graphics to develop a cohesive identity that supports DA efforts. (See the Army Brand Portal website to create an official social media platform.) z Develop policies, SOPs, and training. PA staffs develop organization-specific social media policies, procedures, and training materials. They ensure the material is readily available and provide training to individuals at all levels of their organization, including Family Readiness Groups. )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 A-1 Appendix A Defeating Misinformation and Disinformation COUNTERING MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION WITH CREDIBLE INFORMATION A-1. Countering misinformation and disinformation requires diligent deterrence. PA staffs deter the adversary’s use of misinformation and disinformation with rapid decision making and with informing the public. PA staffs must understand adversarial communication cycles to implement rapid decision making. Deliberate planning that incorporates timely, accurate communication before, during, and immediately following operations mitigates the relative advantage adversaries can gain through speed. PA staffs rapidly make recommendations so commanders can make decisions. Such rapid decision making can reduce lag time through planning while considering the most efficient processes and procedures necessary to produce, approve, and disseminate truthful and accurate information and imagery. A-2. PA staffs counter misinformation and disinformation by informing the public. Adversary disinformation frequently targets the resolve of the American public. PA staffs counter these disinformation efforts by informing the American public of a threat and affirming trust and resolve in the Army and the command. A-3. PA staffs provide a continuous flow of credible, reliable, timely, and accurate information and imagery to internal and external audiences. Being first with accurate information helps the commander establish the narrative. PA capabilities help deter adversary efforts to diminish national will, degrade morale, and turn world opinion against friendly operations. Gaining and maintaining the information initiative in a conflict can help discredit and undermine adversary disinformation, and may discourage adversarial malign narrative efforts completely. A-4. Soldiers assess misinformation and disinformation to determine the source, intent, target, and effects. Informing to facilitate educated decision making counters misinformation and disinformation from others and helps prevent inaccurate information from causing faulty or uninformed decisions. SYNCHRONIZATION WITH INFORMATION-RELATED CAPABILITIES A-5. PA personnel synchronize communication efforts with IRCs to counter adversary misinformation and disinformation. The primary coordinator of Army public information is Army PA. Coordinated and synchronized release of information can help counter disinformation as well as help create, strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of national interests and policies. Synchronized actions, images, and words enables successful execution of a commander’s communication strategy. Army actions that conflict with official statements, information, or imagery can confuse the public and potentially create lost credibility with that public. A-6. As PA staffs synchronize IRCs, they ensure actions, themes, and messages complement, reinforce, and are de-conflicted with each other. Such synchronization facilitates units achieving their objectives. PA staffs use the communication synchronization process to synchronize IRCs. (See paragraph 5-57 for a discussion on communication synchronization process.) PA staffs synchronize with IRCs such as IO and MISO. A-7. It is critical that PA and IO staffs, and especially MISO staffs, synchronize their communications efforts with respect to the adversary due to the fluidity of the information environment. Army PA and IO activities directly support military objectives; counter adversary misinformation and disinformation; and deter adversary actions. Both PA and IO staffs plan and execute information activities and conduct media analysis. IO differ with respect to public, scope, and commander’s intent. As such, IO are separate functional Appendix A A-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ areas. Commanders ensure appropriate coordination between PA and IO activities consistent with the DOD Principles of Information, policy, or legal limitation and security. LINES OF EFFORT RELATIONSHIPS A-8. PA personnel use lines of effort relationships to counter adversary information efforts of misinformation and disinformation. These lines of effort enable PA staffs to focus efforts from many partners to establish operational and strategic conditions by linking their tasks. PA staffs receive information from various sources, staffs, and command levels that often conflicts and contributes to misinformation. PA staffs counter opportunities that adversaries take to undermine the credibility of Army PA, communicators, and other friendly organizations. PA staffs maintain a line of effort drive with— z Intelligence staff. z OPSEC staff. z VI personnel. z Public diplomacy officials. z Staffs from intergovernmental agencies and departments. z Personnel from intergovernmental organizations and nongovernmental organizations. z Host-nation government partners. z Multinational partners. z Military information support personnel. z Information operations personnel. z Military deception (MILDEC) personnel. z Foreign policy advisor. INTELLIGENCE STAFF A-9. Intelligence staff provides historical and human factor analysis that gives context helpful in evaluating and anticipating adversary disinformation. PA staffs coordinate regularly with open-source intelligence sections and use intelligence assessments and products to plan and enhance PA activities. Requests for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information and imagery supports the PA mission. Critical information requirements are often mutual between PA and intelligence sections.Intelligence assessments and products can assist PA in developing communication products and PA information provides content for intelligence analysis. OPERATIONS SECURITY STAFF A-10. OPSEC staffs evaluate information. PA staffs require OPSEC evaluations particularly for risks related to information proposed for public release. The guiding principle to protect classified, sensitive, and enemy exploitive information is security at the source. Information released inadvertently or intentionally that has not undergone an OPSEC review can provide adversaries with an advantage in their disinformation efforts. PAOs are often the designated release authority. They must thoroughly review imagery and information prior to public release. PAOs are required to be OPSEC Level II qualified. (See AR 360-1 or qualifications.) Balancing OPSEC requirements for security with the need to disseminate critical information in a timely manner enables PAOs to ensure adversaries do not obtain material that would assist their disinformation mission. VISUAL INFORMATION PERSONNEL A-11. Visual information effectively counters disinformation. VI personnel provide visual facts to counter deceptive claims or speculation and to bridge the gap between cultures and languages. Quality imagery supported with accurate information has a greater chance of permeating public perception. PAOs use such imagery in products supplemental to traditional and social media channels. VI staffs provide products that assist the commander’s effort to bolster public understanding of operations as well as counter adversarial disinformation. PA staffs consider OPSEC before releasing visual imagery from drones or planes; while useful, some imagery proves difficult to release due to classification. Original, unaltered visual imagery is a Defeating Misinformation and Disinformation )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 A-3 compelling tool in combatting disinformation and lends credibility to commanders’ efforts to establish and promote the command narrative. Altering official DOD imagery is prohibited with exception for corrections, modifications, and enhancements as specified. (See DODI 5040.02 for imagery policy.) STAFFS FROM INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS A-12. Effectively operating in a shared information environment requires PA staff to partner with intergovernmental agencies and other interagency departments interested in communicating common U.S.
Government objectives and activities. Operations require consistent communication with approved themes, messages, narratives, and talking points to support the mission and prevent misinformation. PA staffs work with U.S. Government departments and agencies to communicate information quickly and effectively to the public, avoid misinformation, and prevent opportunities for adversarial disinformation campaigns. An example of this shared information among PA staff and intergovernmental departments is the release of information regarding weapons of mass destruction. Such a release can involve non-DOD lines of communications and authorities such as State Department or other diplomatic entities. PERSONNEL FROM INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS A-13. Intergovernmental organizations and NGOs commonly coordinate communication with PA staffs to mitigate adversarial efforts to spread misinformation regarding foreign humanitarian aid, immunization programs, and foreign government cooperation. Army personnel often work alongside personnel from IGOs and NGOs in theater during military operations. Army personnel deploy to humanitarian aid and disaster relief situations where adversaries will seize any opportunity to discredit and spread doubt. HOST-NATION GOVERNMENT PARTNERS A-14. Host-nation governments often support Army operations when they need to communicate with their audiences concerning activities that Army forces conducts in their borders. Open lines of communications and strong partnerships allow credible information to be shared freely between the host-nation and the Army; PA personnel help the host-nation government with this communication. The host nation ensures that audiences understand its relationship with the Army forces, expectations from Army forces, and achievements by Army forces. PA staffs help the host nation identify local issues and concerns related to Army forces, coordinate with PA staffs at the respective embassy, and maintain close coordination with IO planners. MULTINATIONAL PARTNERS A-15. PA staffs help coordinate and synchronize the necessary messages used with multinational partners to counter adversary information efforts of misinformation and disinformation. As part of the National Security Strategy, the Army commonly works with multinational partners and foreign militaries to build capacity, solve international crises, conduct routine training, and enhance theater security cooperation. Adversaries often seek to fracture multinational partnerships through disinformation in efforts to create an operational area that is more difficult and costly to conduct missions in. MILITARY INFORMATION SUPPORT PERSONNEL A-16. PA staffs coordinate with military information support personnel to influence foreign publics to favor U.S. objectives while countering adversarial misinformation and disinformation. MISO seeks to influence the target public’s attitudes, opinions, and behaviors while PA seeks to inform and educate international publics. Both staffs continually coordinate to ensure they do not deliver misinformation. Military information support personnel can support approved DSCA missions during continental United States operations by conducting civil authority information support. This support can deliver critical information using information dissemination, printing, reproduction, distribution, and broadcasting. The lead federal agency responsible for the content in civil authority information support products coordinates with PA staffs to ensure the prevention of misinformation. Appendix A A-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ INFORMATION OPERATIONS PERSONNEL A-17. IO and PA personnel support the commander’s objectives to counter adversary propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation as well as deter adversary actions. Appropriate coordination between IO and PA occurs during planning their respective communication capabilities to support military operations and accomplish the mission. Although PA and IO IRCs and coordination activities can appear as similar, they are not. IO is a separate function and differs with respect to authorities regarding domestic and international populations, scope, and intent. PA primarily seeks to inform and educate audiences, while affecting the content and flow of information that impacts adversaries’ decision making. IO on the other hand primarily seeks to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting our own. Adversaries often seek to blur the lines between IO and PA operational functions, publics, and information to confuse or influence a target population with no regard for the populations’ situational understanding. MILITARY DECEPTION PERSONNEL A-18. PA staffs coordinate with MILDEC personnel to counter adversarial misinformation and disinformation. MILDEC deliberately misleads enemy military, violent extremists, or other violent adversarial decision makers to take specific actions (or inactions) that can contribute to friendly mission accomplishment. PA personnel and assets provide truthful information that is not used to conduct MILDEC. PA personnel coordinate with MILDEC personnel for the success of MILDEC operations. This coordination ensures that MILDEC operations do not include PA information since such an inclusion violates OPSEC. This coordinated effort leads to a MILDEC operation that has the sole purpose to confuse the enemy. COMMUNICATION A-19. PA personnel use communication to counter adversary information efforts of misinformation and disinformation. Communication that fails to produce understanding by a public through misinterpretation, misrepresentation, or poor delivery can hinder a PA mission and may benefit adversarial malign narrative efforts. An adversary has less difficulty in reaching its objective if the public is misinformed directly through poor communication. A-20. Traditional media are still the principal means to communicate with publics. PA staffs need media access to counter disinformation and ensure the flow of critical and accurate information to publics. PA planning includes detailed processes, procedures, and support requirements to enable media to meet Army personnel so media representatives can better understand the mission, dispel rumors, and dismiss misconceptions of scripted dialogue regarding the conduct of operations. This direct access requires PA staffs to inform unit personnel at all levels on the PA mission. PA staffs implement an active command information program and deliberate PA training. Such training teaches personnel to participate in interviews with news media representatives and respond appropriately to questions regarding operations. Personnel also learn OPSEC for interviews that meets the needs of the media and protects security of the mission. A-21. Operations occur internationally, regionally, and locally, necessitating effective public communication that requires both cultural and language capabilities. PA staffs acquire capabilities to support a range of media in accordance with DOD directives and joint policy. Ideally, PA training, media facilitation, responses to query, and media embed operations can accommodate reporters who do not speak English. PA operations especially focus on accommodating host-nation or regional media outlets critical in informing publics most often targeted by disinformation campaigns. Effective PA operations include news releases, public information, and internet sites with applicable regional or local language capability. A-22. PA staffs traditionally use mass media to reach broad publics. Such mass media often requires communication to be more direct and tailored to specific publics through face-to-face discussion, correspondence, targeted radio broadcasts, newspapers, and digital media. Tailored communication can target friendly, neutral or indifferent, and adversarial publics. A-23. PA personnel develop quality and accurate media products that support the commander’s objectives, set an accurate and truthful command narrative, and deter adversaries. They then leverage available technology to disseminate it rapidly to select publics. Army journalists assigned and embedded in units at all Defeating Misinformation and Disinformation )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 A-5 echelons tell the Army story to intended publics by documenting events and unit actions as they happen. This documentation enables commanders to inform and educate populations in and around a theater of operations. A-24. PA views communication as a dialogue among people and actively facilitates communication with publics internationally and domestically. Encouraging communication among people facilitates commanders to deter adversarial misinformation and disinformation. PA staffs assist commanders with research and theory to identify key publics and create tailored communication plans to meet specific communication objectives. A-25. PA personnel must stay abreast of the rapid changes in communication technology. Traditional media does not solely inform and educate key publics like it used to. Digital video, smart phone technology, chat services, and social media move information around the world almost instantaneously. PA communication plans must account for this reality since PA staffs’ time to shape the narrative is both greatly reduced and greatly enhanced because of it. Recently, viral social media events—especially in video form—have become an influential method for both misinformation and disinformation. Effective PAOs must be prepared to mitigate these types of events when they occur. A-26. Countering disinformation requires consistent, coherent, and comprehensive communication originating from synchronized plans. Such plans can include PA running estimates, key public identification, aligned messages and actions, engagement plans, identified spokespersons and representatives, decision points, and assessment measures. The CCS working group typically guides the communication approach, synchronizes communication, and coordinates internal and external audiences who communicate with the command. TIMEFRAMES A-27. PA personnel use various timeframes to counter adversary information efforts of misinformation and disinformation. Countering disinformation successfully occurs across short-term, medium-term, and long- term timeframes. Tactics and techniques change across these periods, but PA staffs still must coordinate communication simultaneously. PA staffs ensure that actions and communication are complementary and integrated across all periods to counter disinformation. SHORT-TERM A-28. Countering disinformation in the short-term requires identifying and preparing the following: z Topic or issue requiring attention and response. z Spokesperson with credibility, presence, appearance, training, and public relationship. z The type of response necessary. z The speed or timing of response. z Mitigation of misinformation and disinformation. A-29. Rapid decisions are necessary to counter adversary misinformation and disinformation in the short- term. Accurate information delivered first against an adversary requires the commander to assume some risk and may require release authority delegated to lower echelons. The access journalists have affects public perception. The public often perceives granting journalists access to the command for reporting on issues or crisis events as more credible than PA staffs disseminating self-reported information. Third-party advocating is most effective in countering adversarial disinformation. A-30. In addition, PA staffs counter adversarial disinformation by addressing the adversary’s uncertainty regarding the issue, credibility (past and present), lack of verifiable or corroborated information, and transparency. Ideally, PA staffs target the source of disinformation for discrediting, whether an individual or group, to correct the record publically. Deception is the root of disinformation. MEDIUM-TERM A-31. Countering disinformation in the medium-term requires PA staffs to determine the commander’s current position regarding an operational environment. PA staffs then identify and prioritize communication objectives given the time allowed before execution of the disinformation tactics. PA personnel continuously analyze information and the environment. The results of this mid-term analysis define the perceptions, Appendix A A-6 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ attitudes, and behaviors of publics affected by operations. PA staffs gather information to achieve understanding of the publics and prevent opportunities for disinformation effects. A-32. Different publics require different, tailored messages to counter misinformation. In mid-term timeframes, PA personnel have time to tailor messages to reach intended publics. Messages are important communicators of the position a command has on a topic. A mid-term timeframe enables PA staffs to draft support carefully for a particular theme that does not conflict with another theme. With this additional time, internal cultural advisors and other stakeholders can validate a message by analysis thus preventing unintended message perception or vulnerability to adversarial misinformation. A-33. Message delivery requires considering the delivery method, culture, and language barriers. Perception of the message can vary based on leader relationships, public bias of media selected to carry the message, political relationship, and past public communication. Determining the knowledge a public has regarding an issue helps PA to determine whether the communication approach should allow for opposing viewpoints or two-sided communication. A-34. Two-sided communication requires careful planning but is most effective when the public is knowledgeable about the issue or is opposed to the position of the message. This approach also can provide an opportunity for an adversary’s disinformation to be discredited point for point, thus achieving correction of the misinformation. Lack of planning for two-sided communication can just as easily reverse the intended affect and provide credibility to an adversary if the adversary carefully designs misinformation delivered in a manner that a public more easily understands. LONG-TERM A-35. Countering disinformation in the long-term requires nurturing relationships and engaging in a dialogue of ideas. Building and nurturing relationships can be difficult when commanders and personnel change out over relatively short periods. Maintaining consistency of credibility and communication is even more important to ensure the publics that, regardless of the commander, they can expect truthful and honest communication that underpins enduring positive relationships. Stakeholders requiring enduring relationships can include the media, government departments, agencies, NGOs, IGOs, and host-nation governments. A-36. Engagement in a dialogue of ideas can build immunities against disinformation when conducted transparently, respectfully, and truthfully. Respectful consideration for other viewpoints, active listening, and sharing of perspectives on various subjects is valuable against adversary disinformation. Dialogue differs from debate. Dialogue seeks to share and understand various perspectives. Debate typically pits opposing viewpoints against each other and seeks a win. Adversarial disinformation seeks to deceive and confuse a public to advance an agenda not compatible with dialogue. COUNTERING SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION A-37. Social media has demonstrated its ability to inform, educate, and influence, but it is just as capable of providing misinformation rapidly. PA personnel must maintain a consistent and an effective presence on social media to counter disinformation. Active monitoring by trained and informed PA personnel ensures that a continuous dialogue exists among Army forces and domestic and international publics. Depending on the operation, commanders need PA personnel who have cultural and language training to advise on the most effective social media tools and employment strategies. A-38. Social media enables instantaneously addressing misinterpretations and misinformation without the mediation effects that traditional media can have. PA personnel can use social media effectively to address misinformation. However, when countering misinformation, PA personnel cannot depend on only one channel. They require a comprehensive use of traditional and nontraditional media to correct the record. A-39. Adversaries use internet-based communication channels to send false information to susceptible publics. Social media have enabled every user to be a self-proclaimed journalist, publisher, advocate, activist, or spokesperson with no formal training, credentials, or editing for accuracy and facts.Since adversaries can publish anonymously or change user identification, limited accountability exists. Social media were not Defeating Misinformation and Disinformation )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 A-7 designed for disinformation efforts, but adversaries use this technology to support misinformation, deception, and fraud, often with devastating effects. A-40. Disinformation in word and technology is planned and sophisticated deception. Detecting and countering disinformation is even more challenging on social media. Available systems easily portray photographs, information, and news links. Savvy adversaries have adapted such systems to portray any depiction of imagery, events, or news that they create or manipulate. Adversaries can also alter and distribute photographs, videos, and narratives without linking them to a specific disinformation source. Perceptive adversaries can even manipulate accurate truthful news and information to deceive the public. Misinformation and disinformation via social media has proliferated as more people use social networks as their primary information or news source. A-41. Misinformation is not always adversarial, but can materialize from speculative reporting on events or incidents such as accidents, casualty causing actions, and conflicts. PA personnel measure the quality of information by its accuracy and its source. When the public receives unverified political commentary, punditry, rumors, or narratives contrived as facts, they spread as quickly through social networks as facts. A-42. Before countering misinformation, PA staffs must first attempt to understand a public’s reasons for believing the information. Strongly held beliefs based on misinformation can result in greater support for an adversary’s ideology if the counter to the false narrative offends the sensibilities of the receiving public. Therefore, effective PA staffs must be culturally adept and deliberate when dismantling a false narrative lest doing so threatens the mission and command relationship with certain audiences. A-43. Countering social media disinformation can be tricky. Sometimes active countermeasures may actually amplify a false or misleading narrative. Before acting, PA staffs consider whether taking action against or acknowledging the misinformation will cause other negative consequences. These staffs consider if action will increase the public’s awareness to the misinformation or if action will provide the adversary a form of credibility in some publics’ opinion. A-44. If the commander does choose to counter disinformation, PA personnel need to provide a credible and thorough alternative narrative to the disinformation. PA personnel avoid repeating the false narrative, when possible, and without repeating the misinformation. In addition, if mentioning the misinformation is necessary, PA personnel warn the public so as not to falsely credit a source. Finally, PA personnel properly synchronize the efforts of and deliver at a tempo acceptable to all stakeholders. A-45. PA staffs’ counter of disinformation in social media do not significantly differ from traditional or mass media’s attempts. Publics are more likely to accept information that is consistent with other information they perceive as credible. PA staffs analyze the public to determine preexisting beliefs and importance of the beliefs’ role in their acceptance of friendly messages. The publics’ familiarity with the communicator, their established credibility, and mode of delivery all contribute to message acceptance. COUNTER NARRATIVE A-46. Narratives are stories or accounts of events, experiences, or the like, whether true or fictitious. They are stories constructed to give meaning to things and events. Individuals, groups, organizations, and countries all have narratives that reveal how they define themselves. Adversaries often attempt to develop a counter narrative using blatant misinformation and even partially truthful information to promote their agendas. A-47. Army PA supports the Army’s narratives through the truthful telling of the Army story and enduring communication that helps define the commander’s goal and desired end state. Army operations, words, actions, and imagery support the DOD strategic narrative. Failure to design communication around overarching narrative consistently provides adversaries with opportunities to exploit U.S. credibility set at an adversarial counter narrative. A-48. Adversaries of the United States often attempt to develop their own narrative to promote their own objectives and malign narrative agenda. They might use blatant misinformation and even partially truthful information. These opposing forces seek to gain superiority over U.S. or partner nation narratives and discredit the appeal of the friendly narrative while making that narrative irrelevant. This battle of narratives occurs in the information environment but is affected by actions in an operational area, both intended and unintended. Appendix A A-8 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ A-49. Winning the battle of narratives requires PA staffs seeking potential vulnerabilities within the messages and anticipating communication actions of the adversary. PA staffs gain perspective by listening to key publics, understanding their needs, and learning what they expect is part of having a direct dialogue with the same publics that an adversary is attempting to deceive. A-50. PA staffs hold an important position in a battle between competing narratives. Army PA staffs counter the adversarial narrative by executing timely, accurate, synchronized communication. This is the counter narrative, which is simply a narrative going against another narrative. Coordinated counter narratives against adversaries of the United States is necessary to defeat radical violent extremism, adversarial nation states, and non-nation state actors attempting to conduct disinformation operations that threaten an operational area. PA personnel coordinate properly with stakeholders to ensure that a narrative meets the commander’s intent, is useful, is synchronized, and ultimately supports the operation plan. NARRATIVE TYPES A-51. There are two types of narratives: mission and subject. A mission narrative is the expression of the commander’s operational approach for a specified mission. A subject narrative is the expression of the tactical approach for a specified mission. Both narratives aim to be effective. Effective narratives, like other communication products, aid in the dissemination of an organization’s message, assist in the organization achieving its desired effects, and are easily understandable. An effective mission or subject narrative should— z Tell a story by engaging a public. z Explain the history of a conflict (or an operation). z Explain unit or organizational actions such as the role a unit plays in achieving the desired effects. z Explain the way ahead through lines of effort. z List the end state (what success looks like). z Include all stakeholders responsible for executing. z Discuss and use to achieve the intended communication end state. z Be refined as the situation changes to ensure relevance and maintain its ability to impact. A-52. A mission narrative describes the intended effects for the mission, including conditions that define the desired end state. It represents the articulation or description of the commander’s visualization for a specified mission and forms the basis for the concept of operations developed during detailed planning. It is an explicit reflection of the commander’s logic used to inform and educate various mission stakeholders and partners, whose perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors can influence the operation. This is very useful in exponentially increasing communication while protecting the mutual understanding and cooperation that partner communicators share. Common adoption of the mission narrative makes it more difficult for an adversary to inject misinformation into an information environment governed by a common narrative. A-53. Mission narratives inform the development of supporting information themes and messages for the mission. They serve as vital tools for integrating information engagement tasks with other activities during execution. A mission narrative is a concise descriptive account of the mission as a whole. It provides the end- to-end context for the events of the operation or campaign and explains why the operation is necessary. A mission narrative seeks to motivate and facilitate coordinated action by helping the public understand how actions will lead to desired goals and to explain the benefits upon successful conclusion of the effort. It provides a coherent and compelling framework that links the evolution of the situation with the challenges of today, the actions necessary, and the ultimate benefits. A-54. Mission narratives are divided into four parts. Part 1 discusses the history of the area of operations and provides reasons for the conduct of operations in the operational area. Part 2 lists expected successes and planned progression of the operation. In this part of the narrative, an organization’s progression is listed in a 1 to 3 sentence bullets that provide details in support the statement of progress. Part 3 points the way forward focusing on lines of effort that link directly with a higher headquarters’ campaign plan. Part 4 describes how the commander’s desired end state nests with the higher headquarters campaign plan, be it tactical, operational, or strategic. Defeating Misinformation and Disinformation )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 A-9 A-55. A subject narrative is the expression of the tactical approach for a specified mission. It links to a specified mission and is more specific in scope than a mission narrative. Subject narratives contain the same four parts of a mission narrative. In understanding the narrative and its place within the body of available communication products, PA professionals must understand that a narrative is not a stand-alone document, but is supported with other communication products that synchronize the commander’s communications efforts in support of operations. These PA professionals to understand that a single narrative at the strategic level will not effectively support messaging and communication efforts at all levels. Narratives at the strategic, operational, and tactical (unit) levels ideally nest with and support overarching themes, messages, narratives, talking points, effects, and end states via vertical integration for both higher- and subordinate- level organizations. It is critical that narratives nest at all levels with easily ascertainable integration. This page intentionally left blank. )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 B-1 Appendix B Public Affairs Running Estimate RUNNING ESTIMATE OUTLINE B-1. The running estimate provides the basic outline of situations and considerations, mission, courses of action, analysis, comparison, and recommendations and conclusions. Effective plans and successful execution hinge on accurate and current running estimates. A running estimate is the continuous assessment of the current situation used to determine if the current operation is proceeding according to the commander’s intent and if planned future operations are supportable (ADP 5-0). Failure to maintain accurate running estimates may lead to errors or omissions that result in flawed plans or bad decisions during execution. B-2. Running estimates are principal knowledge management tools used by the commander and staff throughout the operations process. In their running estimates, the commander and each staff section continuously consider the effect of new information and update the following: z Facts. z Assumptions. z Friendly force status. z Enemy force status. z Civil considerations. z Conclusions and recommendations. B-3. Running estimates always include recommendations for anticipated decisions. During planning, commanders use these recommendations to select feasible, acceptable, and suitable courses of action for further analysis. During preparation and execution, commanders use recommendations from running estimates in decision making. While staffs maintain formal running estimates, the commander’s running estimate is a mental process directly tied to the commander’s visualization. Commanders integrate personal knowledge of the situation, analysis of the operational and mission variables, assessments by subordinate commanders and other organizations, and relevant details gained from running estimates. Commanders use their running estimates to crosscheck and supplement the running estimates of the staff. B-4. Commanders maintain their running estimates to consolidate their understanding and visualization of an operation. The commander’s running estimate summarizes the problem and integrates information and knowledge of the staffs and subordinate commanders’ running estimates. Each staff element builds and maintains running estimates. The running estimate helps the staff to track and record pertinent information and provide recommendations to commanders. B-5. Running estimates represent the analysis and expert opinion of each staff element by functional area. Staffs maintain running estimates throughout the operations process to assist commanders in the exercise of mission command. Each staff element and command post functional cell maintains a running estimate focused on how its specific areas of expertise are postured to support future operations. Because an estimate may be needed at any time, staffs develop, revise, update, and maintain running estimates continuously while in garrison and during operations. While in garrison, staffs must maintain a running estimate on friendly capabilities. Running estimates can be presented verbally or in writing. (See FM 6-0 for more information on running estimates.) Appendix B B-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ BASE RUNNING ESTIMATE B-6. A comprehensive running estimate addresses all aspects of operations and contains both facts and assumptions based on the staff’s experience within a specific area of expertise. Each staff element modifies it to account for its specific functional areas. All running estimates cover essential facts and assumptions, including a summary of the current situation by the mission variables, conclusions, and recommendations. See figure B-1 for a sample PA running estimate. Public Affairs Running Estimate )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 B-3 Figure B-1. Sample public affairs running estimate [CLASSIFICATION] 1.

[page number] [CLASSIFICATION] )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 C-1 Appendix C Proposed Public Affairs Guidance PREPARING AND OBTAINING APPROVED GUIDANCE C-1. PAG is an operational tool that guides commanders and their PAOs in applying doctrine and policy during major military operations, exercises, and contingencies. Local commanders use the information in paragraphs B-2 and B-3 to assist in preparing and obtaining approved guidance. C-2. DOD policy requires that commanders provide the PPAG to the ATSD (PA) as the sole approving authority by combatant commands and others, as required for all major operations. This requirement includes major training exercises that could attract international or national attention. PAOs commonly prepare PPAG at their echelon and forward that PPAG through command channels for approval. PAOs ensure PPAG is coordinated with appropriate staff and other organizations, as appropriate. PAOs cannot use PPAG without appropriate echelon approval. (See DODI 5405.03 for PPAG guidance.) C-3. Upon receipt of the order, the commander, through the PAO, requests PAG from higher headquarters. PAG may be included in an alert order or operation orders. Commanders direct their PAOs to prepare PPAG to forward through command channels to the appropriate approval authority. Commanders of combatant commands ensure that the staff coordinated the PPAG with appropriate organizations within the theater of operations whenever possible (such as embassies, country teams, host-nation governments, and subordinate commands). PROPOSED PUBLIC AFFAIRS GUIDANCE FORMAT AND CONTENT C-4. PAOs submit PPAG by email as a document with 1-inch margins and Times New Roman, 12-point font. They avoid using “all caps” font. All PPAG submissions include the sections discussed in paragraphs C-5 through C-25 and shown in figure C-1 beginning on page C-6. Insert “N/A” (for not applicable) for each numbered PPAG paragraph that is not needed or does not apply for the specific PPAG. C-5. The format for PPAG is as follows: z Classification z Subject. z Paragraph 1: References. z Paragraph 2: Background and Coordination. z Paragraph 3: Public Affairs Posture. It includes active PA posture and response-to-query posture. z Paragraph 4: Holding Statement. z Paragraph 5: Public Statement. z Paragraph 6: Themes and Messages. z Paragraph 7: Questions and Answers. z Paragraph 8: Public Affairs and Communication Planning Instructions and Command Relationships. z Paragraph 9: Media Operations. z Paragraph 9.1: Owned Media. z Paragraph 9.2: Media Information Centers. z Paragraph 9.3: Media Embeds or Embarks and Space Available Travel. z Paragraph 9.4: Media Operations z Paragraph 10: Public Affairs Points of Contact. z Paragraph 11: Declassification Instructions. Appendix C C-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ CLASSIFICATION C-6. PAOs normally submit PPAG via unclassified email on a Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) system and marked “CUI” (for Controlled Unclassified Information) as the first line of the document. However, PAOs determine the classification of the PPAG according to the classification of the material from which the PPAG was derived and the sensitivity of the event itself. SUBJECT C-7. The subject line of the PPAG states “Proposed Public Affairs Guidance for [Insert Name of Operation, Exercise, or Event].” For purposes of distribution and coordination, the subject remains unclassified. If PAOs cannot use an operation, exercise, or event name, they will use an unclassified short title. When the authority approves the PPAG, PAOs will change the subject line to “Approved Public Affairs Guidance (PAG)” for returning it to the submitting DOD component. PARAGRAPH 1: REFERENCES C-8. Following the subject line, the first numbered paragraph lists references. This paragraph includes all pertinent messages, orders, DOD and military Services publications, publications that apply to PA policy, and the release of information to the public, strategic communication or other guidance, and other documents as appropriate that informed the process of drafting the PPAG. PAOs use the most current version of all references. This paragraph lists references using a lettering system—such as (a), (b), (c)—and, if applicable, include the message date-time-group and the publication date. This paragraph explains what each reference means and how it contributes to the PPAG. This section is generally not for public release. PARAGRAPH 2: BACKGROUND AND COORDINATION C-9. This paragraph explains the purpose of the operation, exercise, or event and describes any significant existing or anticipated problems and limiting factors. It explains how and why DOD assets are participating and why PAG is needed. The paragraph gives background with historical information as well as a description of the current situation. The paragraph may also include communication objectives, key audiences, and other planning guidance on how stakeholders coordinate PA activities among agencies and host nations. This section is generally not for public release. PARAGRAPH 3: PUBLIC AFFAIRS POSTURE C-10. This paragraph states the overall PA posture for the operation, exercise, or event. It also states which DOD component retains the PA lead. Only two PA postures are authorized for use: active PA posture and RTQ posture. Active Public Affairs Posture C-11. An active PA posture is recommended whenever possible. An active PA posture involves using various communication methods and mediums to stimulate public and media interest, such as distributing press releases and inviting media to cover events, exercises, or operations. The term “active” can have multiple meanings; not all active PA postures are the same, with some more limited in scope than others. This posture is specific. For example, if the intent is to start in a RTQ posture and then move to an active posture, this paragraph provides as much detail as possible (for example, using a holding statement until an initial announcement by a public statement or press release). This paragraph provides specific guidance on what tactics commanders desire after the initial announcement. Response-to-Query Posture C-12. An RTQ posture is recommended when there is a desire not to take action to generate media or public interest beyond responding to media queries. On occasion, the PA posture is RTQ until a certain point in the planning and execution of an operation, exercise, or event. At that time, the RTQ posture may change to an active posture. On other occasions, the PA posture will remain RTQ for the duration or until completion of a Proposed Public Affairs Guidance )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 C-3 military operation, exercise, or event. All PPAG should specify all units or personnel authorized to respond to queries. Release authority at the lowest possible level with security at the source is recommended. C-13. Some PA personnel mistakenly believe there is a “passive” option to not say anything about a specific military operation. Not responding to a query is not an option. Professional communicators should always be able to respond using a prepared holding statement, even if it is something as simple as “the information you are asking for is classified and not to be discussed publicly.” If applicable, clearly identify when an RTQ posture will change to an active PA posture. PARAGRAPH 4: HOLDING STATEMENT C-14. PPAG contains a holding statement PAOs use before release of the approved PAG. Usually, the holding statement emphasizes the nature of the planning process and stresses operational details PAOs are not to discuss before an event, operation, or exercise has been formally announced. PAOs can modify this approach as circumstances dictate. When using a strict RTQ posture, sometimes the holding statement may also serve as the only public statement. PARAGRAPH 5: PUBLIC STATEMENT C-15. A PPAG usually contains a statement for public release. PAOs use paragraph 5 in an active PA posture to announce the military activity initially or to respond to queries in an RTQ posture after an operation has commenced. If making a public announcement, this paragraph states who will make the announcement, the method of announcement, the preferred time and date for the announcement, and the rationale for the recommendation. If commanders desire a combined announcement with a host nation or other U.S.
Government agency, PAOs include complete details of the methods, time, and procedures in this paragraph. PAOs usually make public statements 1 to 5 days prior to the start of an event. If PAOs intend to make a public statement long before the event begins, they explain why that action is necessary. If the public statement requires multiple paragraphs, PAOs identify each paragraph as a subparagraph of the message. This paragraph explains the time to make the initial announcement, the method (for example, press release, spokesperson, or social media), and the command. The statement should include “(Begin)” at the beginning of the statement and “(End)” at the end of the statement. The last sentence of any statement should identify points of contact or a web address to gather additional information. PARAGRAPH 6: THEMES AND MESSAGES C-16. This paragraph lists broad themes and specific messages or talking points to use in support of the operation, exercise, or event. These themes and messages may come from a PA communication strategy or other planning guidance. All communication in support of the PPAG consistently aligns with these themes and messages. Successful PA personnel understand that themes and messages provide guidance and are not expected to be used verbatim. Themes and messages should be concise. If applicable, PAOs specify whether some talking points are restricted for use by specific personnel or commands. PARAGRAPH 7: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS C-17. Questions and answers (often called Q&As) are developed to enable PA personnel to respond to the majority of anticipated questions with a recommended range of the most likely and most difficult or politically sensitive questions expected. PAOs arrange the questions and answers in one paragraph and number them sequentially (for example, Q1, A1; Q2, A2; Q3, A3). Questions and answers are for use in both active PA and RTQ postures. If applicable, PAOs specify which questions and answers are restricted for use by specific personnel or commands. PARAGRAPH 8: PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATION PLANNING INSTRUCTIONS AND COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS C-18. This paragraph defines the approving authority by level of command and procedures for the release or clearance of information. This paragraph indicates if there are other proposed PA activities, considerations, or assumptions and whether this PAG is part of a larger communication strategy involving other elements of Appendix C C-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ communication. This paragraph provides the timeline of communication delivery and events (such as legislative engagements, local audiences, think tanks, and regional security centers). PAOs include in this paragraph planning information that does not otherwise fit in the PPAG format that may be unique to the individual operation, exercise, or event. Examples include information regarding political sensitivities, media analyses, description of the communication environment, or command PAO recommendations regarding coordination issues. This information is generally not for public release. PARAGRAPH 9: MEDIA OPERATIONS C-19. This paragraph explains the rationale on whether owned media (such as professional communicators, COMCAM, American Forces Press Service, American Forces Network) and external media coverage is encouraged or not desired. This section is generally not for public release. PARAGRAPH 9.1: OWNED MEDIA C-20. This subparagraph provides instructions on the use of DOD-owned military media; the degree of freedom of movement, including whether escorts are necessary; and the submission and screening of VI materials. PAOs include instructions and information for submissions to the Defense Imagery Management Operations Center (known as DIMOC) and DVIDS. PAOs also specify if host nation-owned media are involved. PARAGRAPH 9.2: MEDIA INFORMATION CENTERS C-21. This subparagraph provides instructions on whether centers are single-Service, joint, or combined. It delineates who is responsible to establish the center. It gives a generic description of its composition such as joint PA support element, U.S. Army desk (listing for example, Army major and staff sergeant), or United States Navy or Marine Corps desk (listing for example, Navy commander and Marine Corps sergeant). This paragraph also establishes the center’s functions such as coordination of all media and PA activities, clearance of U.S. military-generated news material before release, production of news material for release, and escort of accredited news media representatives. Examples of the various types of media information centers include the Joint Information Bureau, Press Information Centers, and Combined Information Bureau. PARAGRAPH 9.3: MEDIA EMBEDS OR EMBARKS AND SPACE AVAILABLE TRAVEL C-22. This subparagraph states whether embeds or embarks are authorized and which command will handle such requests. It lists detailed requirements for news media representatives such as valid passport, working media visa, local accreditation requirements, protective equipment, and funds for food, lodging, and return travel if military air is not available. Additionally, this paragraph provides instructions regarding assistance to continental United States-based units for handling requests from news media for accompanying travel before and following the event. It identifies commanders authorized to provide media transportation on a space available basis. This paragraph provides a chronology of potential events that would be of interest to media. It specifies media ground rules, if established. PARAGRAPH 9.4: MEDIA OPERATIONS C-23. Consistent with AR 360-1 and any supporting guidance from the higher headquarters and approving echelons, this subparagraph provides guidance for using digital media, including social media platforms, to inform families and other interested audiences about unit activities in support of military operations. Digital media websites can be a platform on which units create a command or unit presence. This paragraph indicates whether command and individual Service member usage of digital media is encouraged or discouraged to upload photos or post stories; it provides best practice instructions if appropriate. All Service members must remain cognizant of the power of connected media and understand that every word and photo reflects on the United States and its military. Every word and photo should reflect the appropriate tone given the circumstances of the military operation. Proposed Public Affairs Guidance )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 C-5 PARAGRAPH 10: PUBLIC AFFAIRS POINTS OF CONTACT C-24.This paragraph lists all relevant point of contact names, phone numbers (Defense Switched Network, commercial, and cell phone if applicable), and email addresses. If applicable, information also includes after- hours contact numbers and email addresses if different from normal duty hours. PARAGRAPH 11: DECLASSIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS C-25. This last paragraph describes the declassification instructions in accordance with DODI 5230.09, if required. FRAGMENTARY PROPOSED PUBLIC AFFAIRS GUIDANCE FORMAT AND CONTENT C-26. The format and content for a fragmentary PPAG is the same as for a PPAG but may contain less information than a full PPAG submission. PAOs remove the sections not needed or not applicable for the specific fragmentary PPAG submission. They number each paragraph sequentially. At a minimum, a fragmentary PPAG must include the following: z Classification. z Subject. z Background and coordination. z PA posture. z Holding and public statements. z Themes and messages. z Points of contact. SUBMISSION PROCEDURES C-27. All PPAG and fragmentary PPAG email submissions from the commander, through the PAO, to the approving echelon must include an attached document that can be edited as needed. In the text of the email, the commander formally requests echelon approval and specifies the date it is required for use. The email identifies the document as being fully coordinated and theater-approved and lists all commands and agencies that coordinated on the PPAG or fragmentary PPAG. If the document is transmitted to the approving echelon before it is fully coordinated, the submitting command will ensure the approving authority is promptly informed of the results of the remaining coordination. The PPAG or fragmentary PPAG request email includes all coordinating agencies as information addressees. If in doubt about whether to submit PPAG or fragmentary PPAG, commanders or PAOs seek approval through their higher headquarters in coordination with the defense press office (DPO) directorate at the approving authority. C-28. Most PPAG submissions are CUI and emailed via NIPRNET through a higher echelon PAO to facilitate approval by the ATSD (PA), which allows for fastest interagency coordination. In rare instances, some PPAG requests are classified and require submission to the ATSD (PA) via SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) email. All Unclassified/For Official Use Only PPAG submissions submitted by SIPRNET email will be summarily disapproved by the ATSD (PA) and sent back without comment. C-29. Classified PPAG submissions should always contain an unclassified public statement to respond to query. While the entirety of the PPAG may not be used for the public, an unclassified public statement ensures the public feels informed. C-30. If applicable, PPAG submissions include an explanation of why a specific date is desired for the initial public announcement. Some submissions are time-reliant, and must not be released until it is deemed acceptable. C-31. The commander, through the PAO, submits the PPAG via email to the applicable DPO media officer at the ATSD (PA). The commander sends the email as early as possible but no later than 30 days prior to desired initial announcement date. If the PA office does not intend to make an active announcement, then the commander sends the email 30 days prior to the start of an operation, exercise, or event. Appendix C C-6 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ ASSISTANT TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS STAFFING PROCEDURES C-32. PPAG or fragmentary PPAG requests are assigned to the appropriate media officer from the DPO directorate—usually the media officer who directly supports the submitting DOD component. The media officer then becomes the primary point of contact for the submitting DOD component and is listed under the point of contact (paragraph 10) of the PPAG or fragmentary PPAG. REVIEW C-33. The DPO media officer reviews the PPAG or fragmentary PPAG submission to ensure that it is complete and complies with DODI 5405.03. The media officer then determines which DOD or executive level organizations need to review the PPAG, determines an appropriate suspense date for return comments, and requests reviews and comments. The media officer reviews response comments for incorporation into the PPAG. If comments significantly alter the PPAG, the media officer presents the comments to the submitting DOD component and adjudicates any disagreements. If unable to adjudicate disagreements, the DPO media officer elevates the disagreement to the DPO director for resolution or guidance. APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL C-34. Upon adjudicating and incorporating all the inputs, the DPO media officer prepares a cover memo and submits the final PPAG to the DPO director. The DPO director then recommends approval or disapproval to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Media Operations. Upon confirmation of approval, the PPAG becomes official DOD PAG. The DPO media officer emails the PAG to the submitting DOD component and all relevant addresses. If disapproved, the media officer sends the PPAG back to the originator for changes and resubmission for staffing. ATSD (PA) does not issue the PAG via message traffic, but DOD components are authorized to retransmit in message traffic if desired. Figure C-1.

Communication planning guidance is a method by which senior PA staffs enable subordinate PA staffs to support Army-level communication objectives. PAOs use guidance to publish a communication plan (COMPLAN) at the discretion of senior PA staffs. The guidance helps PAOs complete the COMPLAN. This plan enables senior PA staffs to make clear to subordinate PA staffs the limits necessary for conversations between leaders and media, Soldiers and the public, and through social media. The COMPLAN contains four paragraphs: references, situation analysis, execution, and command and signal. FORMAT AND CONTENT E-2. The content contained in a COMPLAN consists of four paragraphs. Paragraph 1 lists references. Paragraph 2 details the situation analysis. Paragraph 3 addresses execution of the plan. The COMPLAN concludes with Paragraph 4 labeled command and signal that contains contact information. PARAGRAPH 1: REFERENCES E-3. The first paragraph of a COMPLAN lists overarching and month-specific references and other directives pertinent to the communication planning guidance. Common examples at the Headquarters, Department of the Army level include the Army Vision, and Army Strategy. Common monthly examples include communication synchronization products and monthly communication concept of operations produced by OCPA and at echelon.

It details the logical ties between efforts in COMPLAN and specific, quantifiable progress toward communication objectives. 2. SITUATION ANALYSIS x Intent: As directed by the Secretary of the Army, the monthly communication focus for December 20XX is Army Values with a theme of “Commitment by All.”  This is executed through a DAS-directed process as part of the Army Campaign Plan. x Overarching CPA Guidance: The Army Communication Enterprise will… Public affairs professionals should identify events and opportunities that fall within their organization’s area of responsibilities and help amplify the Army Vision and Secretary of the Army’s priorities Figure E-2. COMPLAN paragraph 2 Communication Plan )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 E-3 x Expanded Purpose: December presents a number of opportunities to build trust and confidence in the Army as a values- based institution. The Army Communication Enterprise will synchronize resources and efforts to communicate how Soldiers are ready to fight and win our Nation’s wars while continuing to treat everyone with dignity and respect. Priority will go toward highlighting service in communities and while deployed, commitment to teamwork, and mutual trust. x Communication Objectives: a. Communicate to the American People and Internal Army audiences that the Army is pursuing initiatives to further strengthen the ‘culture of trust.’ b. Communicate the importance of direct leaders to inspire and motivate Soldiers and Army Civilians to embrace a shared identity as trusted professionals. x Target Audiences: OCPA has identified two key audiences for the Army to communicate and engage with during the month of December: a. American People b. Internal Army  Desired Objectives: a. American People: 1. Reinforce the Army upholds high standards and values b. Internal Army: 1. Communicate that the Army is pursuing initiatives to strengthen the culture of trust further based on dignity and respect. 2. Communicate that the Army leaders are committed to strengthening a strong professional organizational climate grounded in the Army Values c. Communicate that it is every Soldier and Army Civilian’s responsibility to strengthen the culture of trust and live the Army Values.  Core Opportunities and Key Challenges: a. Core Opportunities: 1. The month of December provides opportunities to highlight the Army’s commitment to its values: Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. 2. The holiday season, with its focus on family and giving, is a time when most media outlets highlight the contribution of service members with a connection to outlets’ communities and the sacrifices of those serving away from their families during the holiday; both deployed and stationed abroad 3. The end of the year is a reflective period for many Americans. It provides an opportunity to highlight accomplishments the Army has made in the past year to strengthen the culture of trust and strengthening a strong professional organizational climate that exemplifies the Army Values. 4. Focus Events: Army leaders have approved the Army-Navy Football Game, Holiday Block Leave and the Reagan Defense Forum as focus events that should be the backbone of communicating Army Values this month. Other events that provide significant opportunity for messaging amplification include Army Senior Leader outside the continental United States travel, televised holiday greetings from deployed troops, and Army Band performances. Additionally, the Army is observing the National Guard Birthday on December 13. 5. Army Senior Leader Events: Army Senior Leaders have several engagements that will amplify this message. This includes attending the Army-Navy Football Game, the Armed Forces Bowl, the Army Community Partnerships Recognition Ceremony, a Pittsburgh Field Band Concert, and they will visit forward-deployed Soldiers. Figure E-2. COMPLAN paragraph 2 (continued) Appendix E E-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ b. Key Challenges: 1. The holiday season presents limited time for engagements with condensed schedules and significant leave downgrading the availability of all organizations to perform engagements. 2. Unplanned events or the release of information that detracts from the monthly focus (for example, unforeseen geopolitical issues or crises, political or whistleblower controversies, reports, FOIAs, and misconduct.) 3. Sexual Harassment Assault Response Prevention (SHARP) report. 4. Identifying and coordinating with the appropriate staff. c. Desired End State: 1. Base on the FY19 Communication Plan Assessment Framework 2. Contribute to the effort to increase awareness by 10 percent among the American People, by XX Sept XXXX that the Army is a values-based organization. 3. Contribute to the effort to increase awareness among Internal Army by 10 percent by XX Sept XXXX that the Army is a Values-based organization that fosters professionalism and trust. d. Reinforce to Congress that the Army is a values-based organization. Figure E-2. COMPLAN paragraph 2 (continued) PARAGRAPH 3: EXECUTION E-11.

When PA personnel receive a media query, they use several products to facilitate responses: z DA Form 7675 (Media Query). z Query Log Book. z Media briefing checklist. z Communication goals. F-2. Media queries usually start with a phone call or a visit from a media representative who wants information. PA personnel complete DA Form 7675 to record the query whether on the phone or in person. See figure F-1 on page F-2 for an example form. Ideally, PA personnel give the media a response as quickly as possible. However, PA personnel should not commit to getting answers within a certain time. F-3. The Soldier or civilian receiving the query completes DA Form 7675 with clear information. Journalists and PA personnel only answer questions with information that is accurate and cleared for public release. All responses should be free of jargon. PA personnel explain any military terms they use. F-4. Before personnel release information, the PA commander or the agency with release authority must approve the release. Some information is protected from release by privacy act concerns. When a particular query takes an unusually long time to answer, PA personnel contact the media representative and explain the delay. Appendix F F-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ Figure F-1. Sample DA Form 7675 Media Facilitation Products )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 F-3 TOOLS F-5. PA personnel log each query and assign it a local, unit-specific control number. The chief PA escort officer reviews and assigns each query to an action officer or NCO for completion. When the action officer or NCO has completed the query, that officer notes and forwards the response to the chief PA escort officer for review. F-6. After review by the chief PA escort officer, PA personnel request approval to release the query response. When the PA commander or the agency with release authority approve, PA personnel release a query response. The PA personnel use a control number to file the DA Form 7576 as well as the response. F-7. Sometimes PA personnel cannot release a response to a question immediately. This occurs in the case of accidents and hospital conditions. In the case of accidents, PA personnel tell reporters that while military police investigate an accident, the PA office cannot release names until next of kin are notified. PA personnel cannot release conditions of patients in the hospital. Hospitals can release patients’ conditions. They categorize conditions as treated and released, stable, serious, and critical. F-8. PA personnel often host a briefing to answer a media query. These are often referred to as press conferences. During the briefing, the public and media are informed when and where the briefing will take place. The commander will provide a command statement and allow open-forum questions. F-9. To set up for a media briefing, PA personnel need to check that they have the following information and products: basic information, personnel preparation, site preparation, and a sequence plan F-10. Basic information that PA personnel need to gather includes the following: z Briefing subject. z Briefing date. z Briefing time. z Speaker. z Briefing location. F-11. PA personnel check the following items when they prepare personnel: z Speaker provided talking points, five good question, and five bad questions. z Speaker murder board conducted. z Facilitator selected and briefed. z Escorts selected and briefed. z Interpreters selected and briefed. z Rehearsal conducted. F-12. PA personnel check following items to ensure the site is prepared: z Briefing area secure and separated from the tactical operations center. z Briefing area separated from generators or other noise. z Briefing area large enough to accommodate anticipated audience with seating. z Adequate electrical power and outlets for video equipment. z Sufficient lighting and has been checked and tested. z Suitable backdrop. z The following items are on hand (as appropriate):  Computer.  Lectern.  Lighting system.  Maps of area of operations.  News releases or press packets.  Pointer.  Projector screen.  Projector. Appendix F F-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\  Public address system.  Television.  Video player.  Visual aids. z Video camera or digital voice recorder to record briefing. z Event catered or refreshments provided (as per funding regulations). F-13. PA personnel check the following for the sequence plan: z Plan to secure media reception area. z Plan to search media as they pass through security. z Plan to escort media into briefing area. z Ground rules established by facilitator. z Subject matter experts introduced. z Questions monitored and ground rules enforces. z Plan to escort media to reception area when briefing complete. z After action review completed and forwarded to higher headquarters PA office. F-14. PA personnel use agreements to clarify limits with the media: the hold harmless agreement and agreement to reimburse. A hold harmless agreement is used in a legal contract, absolving one or both parties of liability for injuries or damages suffered while under contract. It is initiated by the unit and signed by the civilian media personnel. It is maintained by the unit once signed by the civilian media. See figure F-2 for a sample hold harmless agreement. Media Facilitation Products )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 F-5 Figure F-2. Sample hold harmless agreement Appendix F F-6 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ Figure F-2. Sample hold harmless agreement (continued) Media Facilitation Products )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 F-7 Figure F-2. Sample hold harmless agreement (continued) F-15. Like the hold harmless agreement, the agreement to reimburse is provided by the PAO and is signed by the civilian media personnel. This denotes that some military operations they participate in will incur personal costs. Also, if military or government equipment is issued, the signer agrees to pay if items are damaged or lost. See figure F-3 on page F-8 for a sample agreement to reimburse. Appendix F F-8 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ Figure F-3. Sample agreement to reimburse F-16. PA personnel consider Privacy Act implications before releasing information. The purpose is to ensure the government’s need to maintain information about individuals with the rights of the individuals is balanced. Service members have the right to certain elements of privacy and need to be protected from unwarranted invasions of their privacy. Table F-1 provides PA personnel a checklist that addresses personal information about Soldiers and any living persons that can or cannot be released under the provisions of the Privacy Act. PA personnel use this checklist to determine whether to information meets reliable standards. Media Facilitation Products )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 F-9 Table F-1.

Message mapping is a technique to help commanders and their designated spokespeople connect with audiences on key topics using approved, relevant, command-focused messages. It provides a framework to visualize how facts, stories, and context converge to support specific concepts the commander desires to convey to select audiences in support of communication objectives. G-2. A message map is a template tool used to visualize and process a simple, concise direction for media interviews. With an average video or sound clip diminished to 9–15 seconds, spokespeople must master the art of effectively communicating using succinct, impactful headlines. This one-page tool can assist in the recall and delivery of concise, impactful headlines. Creating a story arc or “dashboard” can help PA personnel sketch an easy way to mentally recall and effectively deliver an intended response. G-3. Message mapping works best when spokespersons develop and employ it as part of a deliberate, overarching communication strategy. PA personnel can also use it easily for unscheduled engagements if they have enough preparation time. It incorporates critical and creative thinking to describe complex issues and develop shared understanding. KEY COMPONENTS OF A MESSAGE MAP G-4. Message maps are composed of interdependent components stitched together to create the command narrative. These key components are: z Top line messages. z Concepts. z Context. z Facts and stories. z Vulnerabilities. G-5. Top line messages are the key, command-approved messages to weave into the narrative during media engagements. Think of these in terms of headlines that bear repeating. G-6. Themes are ideas that recur or pervade. G-7. Concepts are abstract ideas or general notions. G-8. Context is the interrelated conditions surrounding an idea G-9. Facts and stories are used to support the position and point of view of the spokesperson, the commander, and the organization. Select stories that are personal, human, and dramatic. G-10. Vulnerabilities are possible exposures to being attacked or harmed CREATING A MESSAGE MAP G-11. Creating a message map consists of five general steps. First, develop a central theme for clear direction. This identifies the type of command message that will be given. In figure G-1 on page G-3, the theme addresses who (the U.S. Army), what (is aligned), how (by bringing capability and lethality), and when (by 2028). Some themes address where and why. Each theme is command centric. G-12. Second, select no more than five simple key concepts. These are one or two words. In figure G-1, the concepts are mission, vision, people, non-deployables, and recruiting. For each concept category, develop Appendix G G-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ headline messages with solid examples of personal stories or other fact-based evidence to make your message stick. G-13. Third, nest strategic top-line messages within the plan for optimal results. G-14. Fourth, open and close with a central theme and top-concept messages. G-15. Lastly, always define vulnerabilities, and determine how to mitigate them using the dashboard and interview techniques. See figure G-1 for examples of these processes.Message Mapping and Interacting with the Media )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 G-3 Figure G-1. Sample of message mapping template Appendix G G-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ PREPARING FOR A MEDIA ENGAGEMENT G-16. When preparing for a media engagement, PA professionals follow five general rules: z Prepare mentally. z Be message driven, not question driven. z Practice good behavior. z Expect the unexpected. z Never let the setting define you; you define the setting. PREPARE MENTALLY G-17. PA professionals prepare mentally for engaging with the media. They start by sorting complex facts and emotions to help relax the mind and body. They prepare a message map for a clear mental picture of the communication goal. PA professionals use the message map for mitigating vulnerabilities by having a variety of command messages and statements prepared and on-hand. BE MESSAGE DRIVEN, NOT QUESTION DRIVEN G-18. To prepare for a media engagement, PA personnel focus on being driven by the message they are giving. PA personnel have a mental direction and master interview techniques. Interview techniques consist of pausing, repeating, asserting, consistency, headlining, flagging, blocking, bridging, opening, and closing, discussed further in this appendix. PA personnel make verbal and nonverbal messages stick with personal stories, examples, visuals, and anecdotes. For example, if PA staff is asked how successful the mission was, they can respond with their personal positive experiences, pointing out why they viewed it as a success. They avoid Army jargon while clearly understanding the facts, audience, and message. PA personnel use simple words localizing and humanizing strategic messages. They take great care in doing no harm with the engagement. G-19. Skilled PA personnel master bridging to fit their vernacular. They use the following equation: Response = Answer {bridge} + Message + Story. By using the equation, they can help pivot to the direction they want to take the interview. Generally, PA personnel answer to confirm the obvious {...we have been challenged}; bridge {... what I confidently know is…} to a message {American Soldiers are strong and resilient meeting high standards} with a story {let me tell you about Specialist Jackson ….}. G-20. Some media representatives deviate from the approved topic. If their questions are on a hot topic and not associated with the actual agreed-upon topic, the spokesperson acknowledges to confirm the obvious, bridges to a topical message, and moves on. The spokespersons work to be brief and move on. They stay positive and avoid negative words and characterizations. If the media asks five questions on sexual misconduct and the interview goal is about recruiting talent, then the spokesperson has failed to bridge to a topical message and move the conversation in the right direction. PRACTICE GOOD BEHAVIOR G-21. PA professionals practice good behavior when engaging with the media. For a spokesperson, communication is behavior—verbal and non-verbal. PA professionals find harmony by sorting complex details in advance. Through their presence and behavior, they can manage others’ perceptions of them. PA professionals verbally express their authentic, accountable, and credible messages. When PA personnel communicate nonverbally, they remain aware of others’ perceptions. The use their smile appropriately to express happiness. They express anger, fear, contempt, sadness, disgust, and surprise carefully. If while creating a message map PA professionals discover strong emotions such as extreme anger associated with a hot topic, they need to pause. Before they engage with the media, they need to sort through their emotions to prevent an unintended outburst or expression. Skilled spokespersons avoid putting pressure on their body or lips. Such pressure suggests anxiety, tension, and nervousness. They stretch their face and body before an interview as well as practice several times before engagement. Message Mapping and Interacting with the Media )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 G-5 EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED G-22. To prepare for a media engagement, PA personnel expect the unexpected. They anticipate what reporters will likely ask. PA personnel can mitigate vulnerabilities in advance by knowing the Army’s position on current events. They also can minimize hot topics by asserting brief appropriate verbal acknowledgement followed by bridging statements. Skilled spokespersons avoid repeating negative characterizations. When receiving odd or polarizing questions, they use upfront pausing. This means to pause without words for a couple of seconds but to continue natural body flow. Practiced PA personnel take advantage of time and space given in an engagement, even when the media confronts them with tough questions. NEVER LET THE SETTING DEFINE YOU; YOU DEFINE THE SETTING G-23. PA professionals never let the setting define them when engaging with the media. Instead, these professional define the setting. They confidently know themselves, their audience, and other variables like the event flow, timing, and room or venue. Skilled spokespersons keep their hands visible and use them to complement words. If seated at a table, they keep their hands on it in a comfortable position. They avoid squeezing their hands and pulling at their cuticles. They also keep their feet on the floor and their eyes on the reporter asking the questions. They stay hydrated with water and avoid banana and milk products before engagements. PLOTTING A COURSE AND USING DIRECTIONAL PHRASES G-24. When preparing to interact with the media, PA personnel use their message map to plot a course using directional phrases. Before interacting with the media, skilled spokespersons practice their delivery style. The true PA professional maintains a natural style and tone when confronted with hazards during an interview or engagement. PA personnel know and practice directional phrases that lead them to main points. Plotting these directional phrases helps PA personnel reach their destination through intended messages, facts, and feelings. Plotting the course also involves PA personnel visualizing where they need to go. They see their message map illustrating the central theme, concepts, and facts supporting their goal. They use phrases that fit their vernacular. They practice bridging and keeping detours to a minimum. While conducting the engagement, PA personnel handle the unexpected in a savvy pace, pitch, and tone with prepared directional phrases. Using flagging, blocking, and bridging phrases helps PA personnel smoothly get attention, avoid a topic, and transition to a message. See table G-1 for possible directional phrases to help lead the conversation with a message. Table G-1. Sample directional phrases Phrase type Sample Flagging phrases (getting their attention): “Don’t lose sight of the fact…” “The critical issue to remember is…” “The key point to note is…” “It all boils down to this…” Blocking phrases (not going there): “To go any further would be speculation…” “I’m not prepared to talk about that issue today…” “My personal opinion is not important, what is key here is…” Bridging phrases (after answer, before message-transition phrase): “…Yes/no/I don’t know…” “Let me put that into perspective…” “…What I do know is…” “…what’s more interesting is that…” BRIDGING STATEMENTS FOR MEDIA INTERVIEWS G-25. An important media technique is bridging. Bridging is a technique PA personnel can use to take charge of and control an interview with power. A spokesperson uses a media interview to focus a reporter on a few Appendix G G-6 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ key messages that are true, accurate, clear, concise, brief, and memorable. If done well, bridging significantly increases the probability that a spokesperson’s key messages will appear in the final news story. By using bridging techniques, a spokesperson can re-focus or re-direct the interview to what is most important, relevant, and critical. See table G-2 for sample bridging statements. Table G-2. Sample bridging statements “And as I said before…” “And if we take a closer look, we would see…” “And that reminds me…” “And the one thing that is important to remember is…” “And what this all means is…” “And what’s most important to know is…” “And what’s most important to remember is…” “Another thing to remember is…” “Before we continue, let me emphasize that…” “Here’s the real issue…” “Before we leave subject, let me add that…” “However, what is more important to look at is…” “However, the real issue here is…” “If we look at the big picture…” “I think it would be more correct to say…” “In this context, it is essential that I note…” “If we take a broader perspective…” “Let me emphasize again…” “It’s true that…but it is also true that…” “Let me point out again that…” “Let me just add to this that…” “The heart of the matter is…” “Let me put all this in perspective by saying…” “This is an important point because…” “The key here is…” “What I’ve said comes down to this…” “What all this information tells me is…” “What this all boils down to…” “What matters most in this situation is…” “With this in mind, if we look at the bigger picture…” “While… is important, it is also important to remember…” “Before we continue, let me take a step back and repeat that…” “With this in mind, if we take a look back…” )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 H-1 Appendix H Public Affairs Professional Development LEADER DEVELOPMENT H-1. The Army continuously and progressively develops PA leaders over the span of their entire career. Leader development begins with initial entry education and training. This development continues with job experience and attendance at various schools supplying intermediate- and senior-level educational opportunities. While institutional development is important, a self-development program is necessary to ensure the leader has a well-rounded background that supports the rigors and expectations of leadership. The Army carefully assigns leaders to operational positions key to development as PA leaders. Time in the school environment is limited, so careful consideration of operational assignments and self-development is necessary for effective leader development and career progression. TRAINING DOMAINS H-2. Three mutually supporting training domains compose the model the Army uses to develop competent, confident, and professional PA leaders as well as to prepare units for missions with complex communication requirements. Army leader development occurs in the institutional, operational, and self-development training domains. The three domains support PA leader development through education, training, and experience. (See AR 350-1 for a discussion of the training domains.) INSTITUTIONAL TRAINING DOMAIN H-3. The PA institutional training domain includes Army schools and centers that provide initial training and subsequent functional and professional military education for Soldiers, military leaders, and DA Civilians. Army institutions provide military training, subsequent military and civilian education, and mobile training teams that can assist in enabling unit readiness. PA institutional training endeavors to train Soldiers, leaders, and DA Civilians to perform critical PA tasks to prescribed standards throughout their careers and to support Army units. The institutional training domain for PA also provides training support products, information, and materials needed by individuals for self-development and by unit leaders for operational training, mission rehearsal, or assessment. DEFENSE INFORMATION SCHOOL H-4. PA Soldiers, leaders, and civilians receive initial and developmental training at the DINFOS. This school provides PA-specific, joint education and training in mass communication and VI career fields to meet entry-level skills and long-term career development requirements. DINFOS provides training that qualifies individuals for communication-related MOSs and functional specialties, develops individuals for complex duties in progressively higher positions of responsibility, and targets instruction through mobile training teams in areas requiring specialized functional expertise. H-5. DINFOS provides two primary training levels of education to develop PA leaders, Soldiers, and DA Civilians: entry-level and continuum. DINFOS offers on-site and via distance learning courses for both levels. PA professionals can find detailed information regarding DINFOS, available PA courses, and training resources at the DINFOS website. H-6. Entry-level training provides basic PA training to officers and enlisted Soldiers through the following courses: z Military Communication Foundations Course. z Public Affairs and Communication Strategy Qualification Course. Appendix H H-2 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ H-7. Continuum education provides advanced PA training that focuses on doctrine, principles, techniques, and application of military PA. These courses expose students to advanced PA training. Commanders are highly encouraged to send their PA personnel to these courses, where applicable, during appropriate career stages: z Content Management Course. z Joint Contingency Public Affairs Course. z Joint Intermediate Public Affairs Course. z Intermediate Photojournalism Course. z Intermediate Motion Media Course. z Intermediate Public Affairs Specialist Course. CYBER CENTER OF EXCELLENCE NCO ACADEMY H-8. The Cyber Center of Excellence NCO Academy educates, trains, and develops NCOs and leaders. It effectively delivers high quality, innovative, relevant, and diverse professional Army mass communication training in support of the Army’s current and future operations. The Cyber Center of Excellence NCO Academy provides two levels of training for Mass Communication NCOs. z Advanced Leader Course provides leader and specialty training for NCOs in MOS 46S at Skill Level Three (SL3). Training provides students with the skills, knowledge, and technical expertise to provide leadership in coordinating and supervising the employment, operation, and management of a PA section. This course is the required certification course for PA NCOs in MOS 46S30 for the rank of staff sergeant. z Senior Leader Course provides comprehensive skill level four Army leadership training. It also provides training in the supervision, coordination, and operation of PA for senior PA NCOs in Career Management Field 46. This course is the required certification course for PA NCOs in MOS 46Z40 for the rank of sergeant first class. OPERATIONAL TRAINING DOMAIN H-9. The operational training domain involves PA training activities that organizations undertake while at home station, at maneuver combat training centers, during joint exercises, at mobilization centers, and while operationally deployed. This training applies to operating forces and the generating force. H-10. Leaders schedule and are responsible for PA training activities for organizations, units, and individuals in the operational training domain. Proficiency of their unit, teams, leaders, and subordinates is the responsibility of a leader. Individual and collective PA training activities conducted at home station, regional training centers, and mobilization centers as well as during exercises compose an operational training experience. Major training events, combat training center exercises, and operational deployments deliver comprehensive progressive and sequential PA training for unit and leader development and readiness. H-11. Operational assignments develop PA units and leaders. The assignment drives specific mission- focused opportunities and conditions for battle-focused training. Operational assignments use and build on fundamental skills, knowledge, and behaviors developed during institutional training. Operational assignments refine individuals and units by developing their knowledge into capabilities that support the mission. H-12. Mission success requires a well-trained civilian PA workforce to support operating forces and the generating force. Assignments and training that develop DA Civilians provide continuity and specific PA skills essential to Army organizations and programs. PA civilians work at all levels and require opportunities to enhance their knowledge and skills through developmental assignments, civilian education, training, and self-development. H-13. Commanders expect trained units, leaders, and DA civilians to perform in an operational area and should ensure allotted time for leaders and individuals to prepare for and attend institutional training. A necessary balance of education, institutional training, and experience develops leaders and units to train and win in a complex world. Public Affairs Professional Development )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 H-3 SELF-DEVELOPMENT TRAINING DOMAIN H-14. The self-development training domain contains planned, goal-oriented learning that reinforces and expands the depth and breadth of an individual’s knowledge base, self-awareness, and situational awareness; complements institutional and operational learning; enhances professional competence; and meets personal objectives. The self-development training domain facilitates the development of PA professionals. In the self- development domain, PA personnel fill gaps their skills, knowledge, and behavior from institutional training and operational assignments. SELF-DEVELOPMENT TYPES H-15. AR 350-1 describes three types of self-development: structured self-development, guided self- development, and personal self-development.Structured self-development is learning that continues throughout a career. It closely links to and synchronizes with classroom and on-the-job learning. Guided self- development is recommended but optional learning. It helps prepare personnel for changing technical, functional, and leadership responsibilities throughout their careers. Personal self-development is self-initiated learning in which the individual defines the objective, pace and process. Examples include pursuing a college education, advanced degree programs, and professional certifications. H-16. The three types of self-development help in identifying, categorizing, and planning for self- development. The three types of self-development assist leaders, subordinates, and self-assessors to identify opportunities for development that may fall under structured, guided, and personal self-development. Combining the three types of self-development better ensures personnel obtain the most comprehensive plan. H-17. The self-development training domain recognizes that training in Army schools and in operational units often does not meet every individual’s need for content or time. Self-development enables individuals to pursue immediate and long-term personal and professional development goals. Leaders and other PA professionals help subordinates identify areas to implement self-development to improve performance. PA personnel have a personal responsibility to develop, grow, and commit to professional excellence. H-18. Commanders and PA leaders coach, mentor, and counsel subordinates to maximize their self- development as an investment in their future. Successful self-development requires regular self-assessment and performance feedback. An individual development plan (known as an IDP) is important for enlisted, officer, and civilian assessment and feedback. The Army Career Tracker (known as ACT) is a leadership development tool that integrates training and education into one personalized, easy-to-use website. Users can search multiple Army education and training resources, monitor their career development, and receive personalized advice from their supervisor and Army leadership. (See the Army Career Tracker website for developing an individual development plan.) SELF-DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES H-19. Resources for self-development can include Army doctrine, joint doctrine, lessons-learned, best practices, professional publications, and books. Awareness of the events in operational and information environments ensures PA leaders focus on timely and relevant information. Army schools provide training and education products that can be used for self-development. The DINFOS provides publicly accessed training resource material. (See the DINFOS website for training products.) H-20. The Army supports continuing education and self-development. The Army Continuing Education System (known as ACES) mission vigorously promotes lifelong learning opportunities to sharpen the competitive edge of the Army. It provides and manages quality self-development programs and services. Education and training are key elements that mutually support and enhance the combat readiness of the Army. Army Continuing Education System programs and services support leader development and work to expand Soldier skills, knowledge, and behaviors. (See AR 621-5 for more on Army Continuing Education System programs and services.) BROADENING OPPORTUNITIES H-21. The Army provides additional opportunities for PA personnel to broaden their education. Some personnel attend civilian academic institutions. Other personnel participate in the Army’s Training with Appendix H H-4 FM 3-61 )HEUXDU\ Industry program. The Army authorizes training personnel at civilian institutions full time. Officers, NCOs, and warrant officers can attend full-time education programs (fully and partially funded) in civilian schools, commerce or civilian industries, and Service schools that offer accredited degrees. (See AR 621-1 for details on education.) H-22. Human Resource Command encourages units to identify officer positions that require an advanced degree for optimum performance of duties. The Army Educational Requirement System requires units to show detailed positions that require thorough and explicit knowledge in an educational or technical field. Army Educational Requirement System positions may be filled by officers or enlisted already possessing graduate degrees (“direct fills”), by those attending advanced civil schooling (ACS), or by those who completed a Training with Industry (TWI) program. Personnel who attend ACS or TWI will incur an active duty service obligation. (See AR 621-1 for more on the Army Educational Requirement System.) TRAINING WITH INDUSTRY H-23. The TWI program is a yearlong work-experience program. For PA personnel, it provides extensive in- depth exposure to public relations, marketing, and managerial techniques and industry standards from Fortune 500 companies. It provides military personnel with training and development of skills in the private sector. Often personnel learn procedures and practices not available through existing military programs, ACS, or other established training and professional military education programs. H-24. TWI is a voluntary program, with an emphasis on placing Soldiers with strong promotion potential and varied PA experiences and assignments into the program. A panel of senior military members select applicants carefully to ensure the most qualified PA Soldiers represent the Army and PA. After completing the TWI program, Soldiers are assigned to an Army Education Requirement System validated position. ARMY PUBLIC AFFAIRS ADVANCED CIVIL SCHOOLING H-25. Army PA ACS is a threefold broadening opportunity program. First, it provides outstanding officers and senior NCOs who possess strong promotion potential an opportunity to better understand and appreciate the importance of the strategic relationships among the Army, academic leaders, and industry leaders. Second, it exposes academic and industry leaders to the quality of Army officers and senior NCOs serving in today’s Army. It assists those leaders in learning about the Army as an institution through contact with Army fellows enrolled in the Georgetown University’s Public Relations and Corporate Communications Program. Lastly, PA ACS continues to develop a pool of officers and senior NCOs to serve in challenging and rewarding PA assignments in the PA career field. Selected officers and NCOs pursue an advanced degree at Georgetown University on a full-time basis. Fellows attend school for 18 months. They complete the required degree program and associated curriculum earning a master’s degree in public relations and corporate communications. )HEUXDU\ FM 3-61 Source Notes-1 Source Notes This division lists sources by page number.

This publication applies to HR in support of the range of military operations and is nested with Army Doctrine Publication (ADP) 3-0, Operations, ADP 4-0, Sustainment, FM 3-0, Operations, and FM 4-0, Sustainment Operations. While FM 1-0 is the Army’s primary source of doctrine for HR support, this publication along with Army Techniques Publication (ATP) 1-0.1, G-1/AG and S-1 Operations, and ATP 1-0.2, Theater-Level Human Resources Support, provides a complete library detailing HR support at all levels of execution. The principal audience for FM 1-0 is all Army Soldiers and civilians who provide HR support as well as those members of the Army profession who depend on and receive that support. Commanders and staffs of Army headquarters (HQ) should also refer to applicable joint or multinational doctrine concerning support to joint or multinational forces. Trainers and educators throughout the Army will also use this publication. Commanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure their decisions and actions comply with applicable United States, international, and, in some cases, host-nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels ensure their Soldiers operate in accordance with the law of war and the rules of engagement. (See FM 6-27/MCTP 11-10C, The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Land Warfare). FM 1-0 uses joint terms where applicable. Selected joint and Army terms and definitions appear in both the glossary and the text. Terms for which FM 1-0 is the proponent publication (the authority) are italicized in the text and marked with an asterisk (*) in the glossary. Terms and definitions for which FM 1-0 is the proponent publication are boldfaced in the text. For other definitions shown in the text, the term is italicized and the number of the proponent publication follows the definition. FM 1-0 applies to the Active Army, Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States, and the United States Army Reserve unless otherwise stated. The proponent of FM 1-0 is the United States Army Combined Arms Support Command. The preparing agency is the G-3/5/7 Doctrine Division, United States Army Combined Arms Support Command.

This page intentionally left blank. 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 vii Introduction While the United States (U.S.) Army must be manned, equipped, and trained to operate across the range of military operations, large-scale combat operations (LSCO) against a peer threat represent the most significant readiness requirement (FM 3-0). FM 1-0 provides commanders, staffs, and Soldiers at all echelons, an understanding of HR support operations at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of warfare, laying the foundation for responsive, integrated, synchronized, continuous, timely, and accurate HR support.FM 1-0 further emphasizes how HR professionals, HR organizations, and HR systems work together with the combatant commander to support readiness, modernization and reform, to compete against peer threats and prevail in LSCO. Human resources doctrine must be complete enough to guide operators, yet not so prescriptive that it limits support for commanders and their Soldiers. Much like tactical commanders, HR professionals must be versatile and able to improvise to ensure continuing support. Dictating a doctrinal response to outline all possibilities would tie the hands of the supporter. Knowledge of doctrine regulations, combined with experience, provides a foundation for superior execution. FM 1-0 makes numerous revisions from the 2014 edition. Significant revisions include implementing elements of FM 3-0, Operations, and FM 4-0, Sustainment Operations, into FM 1-0 to support LSCO; the addition of HR support to replacement operations, a new subordinate key function; and realignment of HR core competencies and subordinate key functions. Army Service component command (ASCC), corps, and division assistant chief of staff, personnel (G-1)/adjutant general (AG) sections now include the human resources operations center (HROC) with a description of the organization’s critical functions. This revision also replaces the human resources sustainment center structure with the theater personnel operations center (TPOC). The corps G-1/AG and division G-1 and battalion or brigade personnel staff officer (S-1) duties and responsibilities were removed as they are currently contained in ATP 1-0.1. Other revisions include removal of redundant verbiage and figures throughout the publication already contained in ATP 1-0.1 and ATP 1-0.2; updates to applicable figures and tables; addition of vignettes; administrative changes; and revisions to glossary and reference sections. FM 1-0 contains seven chapters and one appendix. Chapter 1 discusses HR support under the sustainment warfighting function in the context of HR objectives, principles, and focus. This chapter also provides overviews of HR core competencies and their subordinate key functions, HR support to operations, Army command and support relationships, HR support to unified land operations, and HR planning and operations. Chapter 2 provides an overview of HR echelons, organizations, and staff elements, including SRC 12, HR Organizations and SRC 02, Army Bands. This chapter provides discussion on strategic, operational, and tactical level HR support and the rules of allocation for HR organizations. This chapter also clearly articulates the role of the adjutant. Chapters 3 and 4 describe, in detail, the two HR core competencies of man the force and provide HR services. These chapters also include the subordinate key functions, which contribute to the success of each core competency. Chapter 5 provides an overview of coordinate personnel support, which includes command interest programs and retention operations. These support functions may fall under the purview of the G-1/AG and S-1. Chapter 6 provides an overview of Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of the Army (DA) Civilians and contractors authorized to accompany the force (CAAF) support in the areas of personnel accounting and strength reporting (PASR), HR support to casualty operations, postal support, and morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) support. This chapter also includes details on civilian and CAAF personnel deployment and redeployment. Introduction viii FM 1-0 25 August 2021 Chapter 7 provides an overview of HR support and planning considerations for each Army strategic role (shape the operational environment, prevent conflict, prevail in large-scale combat operations (defensive/offensive), and consolidate gains during LSCO. Each section describes the role, overview, and HR planning considerations at each echelon for conducting PASR, HR support to replacement and casualty operations, postal operations, and other HR considerations incorporated during LSCO. Chapter 7 also provides an overview of HR training considerations for LSCO. Appendix A discusses various HR databases, systems, and other automation systems and equipment used by HR professionals in performing HR missions. FM 1-0 does not introduce, modify, or rescind any Army terms or acronyms. 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 1-1 Chapter 1 Human Resources (HR) Support This chapter provides overviews of HR support, HR support to operations, Army command and support relationships, HR support to unified land operations, and HR planning and operations. The publication of FM 3-0, Operations, in October 2017 signaled the readiness focus of the United States (U.S.) Army in how it will deter adversaries and fight against a peer threat today, with today’s forces and today’s capabilities. Large-scale combat against a peer threat represents the most significant readiness requirement; being expeditionary ultimately means deploying on short notice and being able to conduct combat operations immediately. Moving from brigade- centric operations to fighting corps and divisions as tactical formations in accordance with (IAW) FM 3-0 fundamentally changes the calculus behind HR support at echelon. Solutions to mitigate risks across doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy areas are being pursued. Implementing these solutions is essential in the Army’s success in LSCO because HR support directly impacts readiness and sustainability. SECTION I – OVERVIEW OF HR SUPPORT 1-1. Human resources support describes those systems that belong to the manning and personnel services support portion of sustaining Soldiers and their systems. Human resources support is an element of personnel services aligned under the sustainment warfighting function. The sustainment warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that provide support and services to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance (ADP 3-0). Systems consist of personnel, networks, information systems, processes and procedures, and facilities and equipment enabling commanders to support operations. The sustainment warfighting function consists of four major elements: logistics, finance and comptroller operations, personnel services, and health service support, each of which must be synchronized across all warfighting functions to ensure the appropriate level of support. Each element is guided by a set of specific principles. Personnel services are sustainment functions that man the force, maintain Soldier and Family readiness, promote the moral and ethical values of the Nation, and enable the fighting qualities of the Army. Personnel services support is the management and execution of personnel-related functions including HR, legal, religious, and Army band support. This manual will discuss only HR and band support. 1-2. Human resources doctrine establishes the foundation for HR support activities of HR organizations and staffs throughout the Army. Human resources support encompasses two core competencies: man the force and provide HR services. Embedded in these competencies are nine critical functions, including:  Personnel readiness management (PRM).  Personnel accounting and strength reporting (PASR).  HR support to casualty operations.  HR support to replacement operations.  Personnel information management (PIM).  Essential personnel services (EPS).  Postal operations.  Army band operations.  Morale, welfare, and recreation operations. Chapter 1 1-2 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 1-3. Human resources support is a critical part of determining current combat capabilities and projecting future requirements to sustain or build combat power throughout all phases of LSCO. Success on the battlefield will depend, in part, on the effective execution of HR competencies. Through the execution of these competencies, essential personnel information is collected, analyzed, and used by commanders in the decision-making process to sustain the fight. Regardless of the type of military operation, HR support must be tailored to satisfy requirements of Army commanders or in concert with a joint or combined force. 1-4. Human resources support is executed at strategic, operational, and tactical levels. At the strategic-level, HR support encompasses national mobilization and falls within the purview of national political and military-strategic leadership. Strategic HR support deals with mobilization of the Reserve Component (RC) and national manpower, acquisition and integration, deployment, and demobilization. It links the nation’s natural resources (people) to theater military operations. Operational HR support focuses on reception, allocation, management, and redeployment of units and Soldiers as well as reconstitution operations. Tactical HR support focuses on the specific functions of manning units and sustaining Soldiers and units. 1-5. Human resources support includes all activities and functions executed within the eight Army personnel development system life cycle management functions (structure, acquisition, distribution, development, deployment, compensation, sustainment, and transition). These functions man the force and provide HR support and services to Soldiers, their families, military retirees, and Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of the Army (DA) Civilians. Refer to Army Regulation (AR) 600-3, The Army Personnel Development System, for specific information regarding the Army personnel development system life cycle management functions. PRINCIPLES OF HR SUPPORT 1-6. A principle is a comprehensive and fundamental rule or an assumption of central importance that guides how an organization approaches and thinks about the conduct of operations (ADP 1-01). All sustainment operations are guided by fundamental principles that apply in LSCO as well as any other operation along the conflict continuum. The principles of sustainment enable freedom of action, create strategic and operational reach and provide the joint force with prolonged endurance. The principles of sustainment are integration, anticipation, responsiveness, simplicity, economy, survivability, continuity, and improvisation. 1-7. Human resources support uses a competency-based and performance-oriented strategy guided by enduring principles that assure a higher quality, more diverse and ready Total Army enabled by effective HR systems and agile policies. Human resources leaders should not only understand the importance of their efforts and unit mission, but also the missions of their supported and supporting units. To meet the challenges of current and future operations, HR professionals are guided by the six overarching principles of sustainment and three additional principles of HR support (synchronization, timeliness, and accuracy). These principles must be thoughtfully weighed and applied during the planning, execution, and assessment of missions. INTEGRATION 1-8. One of the primary functions of the sustainment staff is to ensure the integration of sustainment with operations plans. Integration combines all sustainment elements within operations, assuring unity of command and effort. It requires deliberate coordination and synchronization of sustainment with operations across all warfighting functions. Army forces integrate sustainment with unified action partners to maximize the complementary and reinforcing effects of each Service component’s and other unified action partners’ resources. The success of strategic, operational, and tactical plans depends on the integration of HR concepts and operations with those plans. The time needed to arrange HR support and to de-conflict problems requires continuous integration of HR support into the planning process. To enable HR professionals to weigh the supportability of proposed courses of action, personnel estimates and plans that are grounded in doctrine must be developed and incorporated into operation plans (OPLANs). ANTICIPATION 1-9. Anticipation is the ability to forecast operational requirements and initiate necessary actions that most appropriately satisfy a response, without waiting for operations or fragmentary orders. That ability requires Human Resources (HR) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 1-3 professional judgment augmented with experience, training, education, intelligence, and intuition. Commanders and staffs need to understand and visualize future operations to identify the appropriate required support; then start the process of acquiring the resources and capabilities to best support the operation. Anticipation is facilitated by automation systems that help clarify the common operational picture (COP) on which judgements and decisions are based. Commanders integrate risk management into the operations process to identify threats, assess those threats, and emplace controls to mitigate the risk of gaps in support. Human resources professionals must accurately anticipate the impact changing tactical situations will have on HR systems and processes. They must also clearly understand the commander’s vision and intent to anticipate the requirements of providing critical and timely HR support. Rather than merely reacting to support requirements, HR professionals must use sound judgement to forecast HR requirements and initiate maintenance or accumulation of HR assets necessary to support the operation. This effort requires maintaining running estimates that support a COP and project HR requirements. RESPONSIVENESS 1-10. Responsiveness is the ability to react to changing requirements, then responding to meet the needs to maintain operational reach, freedom of action, and prolonged endurance. Responsiveness provides the right support to the right place at the right time. Responsiveness involves identifying, accumulating, and maintaining sufficient resources, capabilities, and information necessary to meet rapidly changing requirements. Through responsive sustainment, commanders maintain operational focus and pressure, set the tempo of friendly operations to prevent exhaustion, replace ineffective units, and extend operational reach. Responsive HR support enables commanders to meet changing requirements on short notice. These quick- reaction efforts may temporarily disrupt long-range HR support planning, but they are required for operational success. To provide responsive support, HR professionals must understand the missions of supported units. An HR COP integrated with the Army Readiness COP and follow-on business intelligence tools associated with Army enterprise resource planning systems facilitate responsiveness. That COP enables commanders to see all supported forces, anticipate requirements based on situational understanding, and provide support when and where needed. Even in the absence of automated reporting, HR professionals must maintain awareness of the status and capabilities of units to provide timely and effective HR support. Responsiveness means adjusting HR support to meet commanders’ needs. Responsiveness is the ability to readily adapt to different or changing HR demands. SIMPLICITY 1-11. Simplicity relates to processes and procedures designed to minimize the complexity of HR support operations. Simplicity enables economy of and efficiency in the use of available resources, while ensuring effective HR support of forces and Soldiers. Unnecessarily complex HR support processes and procedures can lead to confusion. Human resources professionals must understand and clearly communicate elements pertaining to HR support (tasks, functions, systems and organizations). Clarity of HR requirements, tasks, standardized and interoperable procedures and clearly defined command relationships contribute to simplicity. ECONOMY 1-12. Economy is providing HR support in an efficient manner that enables the commander to employ all assets to the greatest effect possible. Human resources professionals achieve economy through the efficient management, prioritization, and allocation of personnel replacements and HR assets. Economy is further achieved by eliminating redundancies (unnecessary HR processes and procedures) and capitalizing on collaboration with other staff sections for efficiency and effectiveness of HR support. Disciplined HR support by HR leaders assures the greatest possible reliability of HR processes and procedures to commanders. SURVIVABILITY 1-13. Survivability is based on being able to protect HR support functions from destruction or degradation. Human resources professionals contribute to ensuring HR support (tasks, functions, systems and organizations) are adaptable and can endure in any type of operational environment. Chapter 1 1-4 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 SYNCHRONIZATION 1-14. Synchronization is ensuring HR support operations effectively align with military actions in time, space, and purpose. Synchronization requires planning and promotes unity of effort. It includes ensuring HR operations are planned, executed, and assessed. Human resources professionals must understand the commander’s vision of the end state and how to sequence activities to achieve them. When resources are not forward-deployed, early entry, build-up, and sustainment are highly complex. Joint and combined operations also demand careful synchronization of HR support to ensure effective interoperability and efficient use of all available resources. The result of synchronization is the maximum use of every resource when and where it will contribute most to success. TIMELINESS 1-15. Timeliness ensures decision makers have access to relevant HR information and analysis that support current and future operations to make effective decisions. It also supports a near real time COP across all echelons of HR support. Maintaining a near real-time COP will be a challenge in LSCO against a near-peer; therefore, HR professionals must plan for ways to improve the timeliness of the HR COP in both connected and disconnected environments. ACCURACY 1-16. Accuracy of information not only influences the decisions made by commanders, but also impacts Soldiers and their families. For Soldiers, accurate information affects their careers (for example, retention, compensation, and promotion) while supporting the general well-being of their family members. Accuracy of information is critical to ensure the integrity of HR processes. Human resources professionals must understand the dynamic nature of HR systems architecture and that data input at the lowest level has a direct impact on decisions made at the highest level. It is critical for HR professionals to ensure the accuracy of the information they provide to support commander’s decision making. FOCUS OF HR SUPPORT 1-17.Efficient and effective HR support relies on multi-functional HR leaders who focus their knowledge and skills to support the Army’s most important asset–its people. In all areas, HR professionals should focus on the following:  Agile and clear HR policies. Human resources policies must be clear, encompassing, and flexible enough to apply to the greatest number of personnel and address the widest range of circumstances. They must be adaptable enough to guide and inform personnel in complex and changing circumstances (both in a connected and disconnected environment).  Effective HR practices. Human resources practices emanating from the policy-level should be streamlined, intuitive, and foster stable and predictable process results.  Competency-based skills. Human resources professionals must be competent and able to accomplish HR core competencies and subordinate key functions. Core competencies align the responsibilities, knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to fulfill mission requirements.  Outcome-oriented actions. In an environment that measures HR performance, the emphasis is on successful outcomes in fulfillment of mission priorities. While it is important to have effective HR processes and practices in place, it is critical that the ends drive the means.  Self-development. One of the three domains of leader development, it requires leaders to display discipline and a desire for excellence in lifelong learning. Using assessments, HR leaders must invest the time to become competent and confident across all facets of HR operations and support. CORE COMPETENCIES AND KEY FUNCTIONS OF HR SUPPORT 1-18. Human resources professionals must execute two fundamental core competencies in providing HR support. As depicted in figure 1-1, each of the two core competencies includes subordinate key functions, which contribute to the success of the core competency. Figure 1-1 emphasizes the critical role of personnel information management as the connective force supporting the execution of all HR core competencies and Human Resources (HR) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 1-5 subordinate key functions. Although coordinate personnel support is no longer a core competency, command interest programs and retention operations are support functions that may fall under the purview of the G-1/AG and battalion or brigade personnel staff officer (S-1). These support functions are command driven and often shared staff functions with execution responsibility dependent on the echelon and commander’s intent. Figure 1-1. Human resources support CORE COMPETENCIES OVERVIEW 1-19. Success on the battlefield depends, in part, on the effective management of HR support. Human resources operations enhance combat power by providing information and support to both commanders and Soldiers. Human resources support concepts serve two major areas of concentration: support for commanders and units (manning) and support to Soldiers (sustaining Soldiers). Each subordinate key function can be described in terms of command support and Soldier support activities. For example, PRM supports Soldiers by ensuring they are prepared to deploy, and their personal documents, such as DD Form 93 (Record of Emergency Data), Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLV) Form 8286 (Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Election and Certificate), and SGLV Form 8286A (Family Coverage Election and Certificate), are current. This subordinate key function also manages unit readiness, ensuring the unit is manned with deployable Soldiers. It further supports commanders by providing them with real-time information about the combat-ready strength of their units. 1-20. Human resources professionals, units, and staffs perform the core competencies and subordinate key functions at all levels. For example, commanders at company-level are responsible to account for Soldiers and DOD and DA Civilians and accurately report their duty status daily to the S-1, who in turn conducts PASR for the battalion which is monitored at higher echelons. Commanders and HR leaders should use ADRP 1-03, The Army Universal Task List, and the Central Army Registry website as a reference tool for developing general mission essential task lists; core capabilities mission essential tasks; operational orders; and standard operating procedure (SOP). Chapter 1 1-6 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 PERSONNEL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT 1-21. Personnel information management is the foundation of successful man the force operations, and is the connective force that supports the execution of all HR core competencies and subordinate key functions. It encompasses the collecting, processing, storing, displaying, reconciling, and disseminating of relevant HR information about units and personnel. Personnel information management provides essential personnel information to commanders, Soldiers, and families. It integrates and distributes the information products necessary to man and sustain Soldiers and their systems on the battlefield. Commanders, HR professionals, and planners rely on personnel information management systems when performing their mission. 1-22. Human resources systems are essential in accomplishing Army-wide PIM execution and COP integration. It is critical for HR professionals to be competent with HR systems and databases and understand how HR functions and tasks are processed and conducted. Commanders should ensure HR professionals are cross-trained across all HR systems. Despite the expectation for units to operate in disconnected, degraded or disrupted communications environments during LSCO against near peer competitors, HR professionals should prioritize the maintenance of Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) and SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) connectivity when arriving in theater to conduct required HR functions and tasks. For specific information regarding HR databases, systems, and other automation systems and equipment needed to perform HR missions, refer to appendix A of this publication. 1-23. As the enemy’s ability to disrupt communications and command and control elements increases, HR support and services becomes more challenging. This is especially true when the enemy targets mission command nodes and critical infrastructure. Enabling HR mission command nodes by establishing, operating, and maintaining connectivity to HR data and voice communications is essential for effective HR operations. Human resources mission command nodes enable HR professionals’ access to HR systems and must provide access across all commands and echelons. Refer to ATP 6-0.5, Command Post Organization and Operations, for additional information on mission command nodes. MAN THE FORCE 1-24. Man the force consists of subordinate key functions affecting the personnel aspects of building and maintaining the combat power of an organization. Man the force encompasses PIM, PASR, HR support to replacement operations, HR support to casualty operations, and PRM. Successful execution of these subordinate key functions assures the uninterrupted flow of Soldiers to the battlefield and accurate accountability and reliable data for all Soldiers, DOD and DA Civilians, and contractors authorized to accompany the force (CAAF). The following paragraphs provide a brief description of each subordinate key function of man the force. Refer to chapter 3 for detailed information regarding each function. Personnel Accounting and Strength Reporting 1-25. The objective of PASR is to account for Soldiers, report strength-related information, and update command databases at all levels. Personnel accounting is the by-name management of the location and duty status of every person assigned or attached to a unit. It includes tracking the movement of personnel as they arrive and depart from a unit, to include maintaining visibility of individuals as they enter, transit, and depart the theater. Battalion and brigade S-1s manage HR systems supporting theater and Army-wide personnel accountability. Strength reporting is the numerical end product of by-name data and conducted at all levels of command. The process starts with by-name personnel accounting data submitted at battalion or separate unit-level and ends with personnel systems updates. Strength reports reflect the combat power of a unit and inform PRM actions such as prioritizing replacements, monitoring deployable and non-deployable personnel, executing personnel distribution, and making decisions. HR Support to Replacement Operations 1-26. Human resources support to replacement operations is an ongoing and enduring effort beginning in the planning phase and continuing through redeployment. Human resources support to replacement operations includes communicating the priority of manning in coordination with the Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), deputy chief of staff (DCS), Operations/Readiness/Exercises (G-3/5/7) and the HQDA, DCS, Logistics (G-4); maintaining personnel accountability; executing orders processing; and conducting Human Resources (HR) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 1-7 coordination with the appropriate sustainment support units and agencies. Replacement operations is a complex function dependent on extensive coordination at all echelons and extensive support from sustainment formations. Replacement operations facilitate the movement of units and individual personnel from point to point to regenerate or maintain combat power and readiness. At the macro-level, these include housing, feeding, transportation, training, equipment, and medical support during transit and until delivery to the gaining unit. HR Support to Casualty Operations 1-27. The objective of HR support to casualty operations is the collecting, recording, reporting, verifying and processing of casualty information from unit-level to HQDA. The recorded information facilitates casualty tracking, status updates, next of kin (NOK) notification, and casualty assistance, and provides the basis for historical and statistical reports. This information is also shared with other DOD and Army agencies. Accuracy of data and timeliness of reporting are critical components of HR support to casualty operations and depend on access to correct personnel information and communications. Personnel Readiness Management 1-28. The objective of PRM is to maximize wartime preparedness by distributing Soldiers to subordinate commands based on the commander’s intent and documented manpower requirements and authorizations. Personnel readiness management supports a state of mission preparedness and is a process for achieving and maintaining that state. The process involves analyzing personnel strength and readiness data to determine current combat capabilities, project future requirements, and assess individual and unit readiness. It starts with the comparison of an organization’s personnel strength against its requirements or authorizations, and it ends with a personnel readiness assessment and allocation decision. Personnel readiness management is directly interrelated and interdependent with the functions of PASR, HR support to replacement and casualty operations, and PIM. PROVIDE HR SERVICES 1-29. Provide HR services are those functions conducted by HR professionals that specifically affect Soldiers and their family members, DOD and DA Civilians, and organizations. These services include EPS, postal operations, Army band operations, and MWR operations. The following paragraphs describe each subordinate key function of provide HR services. Refer to chapter 4 for detailed information regarding each function. Essential Personnel Services 1-30. Essential personnel services include HR actions affecting Soldier status, readiness, and quality of life and allow Army leadership to manage the force. Essential personnel services include: awards and decorations, evaluation reports, promotions and reductions, transfers and discharges, identification (ID) documents, leaves and passes, line of duty investigations, Soldier applications, and processing of military pay and entitlements. Postal Operations 1-31. Postal operations provide mail and postal finance services during normal and contingency operations. Processing mail involves receiving, separating, sorting, dispatching, coordinating for transportation, and redirecting ordinary, official, insured, certified, return receipt, and registered mail. Postal operations also include conducting multinational and international mail exchange and handling official, casualty, contaminated/suspicious, and enemy prisoner of war (EPW) mail. Postal finance services include selling postage stamps, cashing and selling money orders, mailing packages, providing insured and certified mail services and registered and special services (including classified up to secret level), and processing postal claims and inquiries. Chapter 1 1-8 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 Army Band Operations 1-32. Army band operations provide support to the deployed force by tailoring music support throughout military operations. Army bands promote the Army and our national interests, enable commanders to shape the environment to accomplish their mission, and set the conditions that lead to trust and confidence in America’s Army and its readiness to conduct operations in peacetime, conflict, and war. Army bands contribute to unit readiness by building morale and cohesion, enhancing quality of life for Soldiers, DOD and DA Civilians, and other personnel who deploy with the force. See ATP 1-19, Army Music, for detailed information on Army band operations. Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Operations 1-33. Morale, welfare, and recreation programs support readiness by assisting personnel with maintaining physical fitness and alleviating combat stress. The G-1/AG and S-1 coordinate for MWR support with Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) and American Red Cross (ARC) agencies. See AR 215-1, Military Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Programs and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, for detailed information regarding MWR programs. INTERCONNECTED HR SUPPORT FUNCTIONS 1-34. Human resources support functions provide an interconnected system that sustains the fighting force and contributes to both national will and the will of the Soldier to fight. Through the execution of HR core competencies and their subordinate key functions, essential personnel information is managed, analyzed, and used by commanders in the decision-making process. Figure 1-2 depicts interconnected HR support functions. Figure 1-2. Interconnected human resources support functions Human Resources (HR) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 1-9 COORDINATE PERSONNEL SUPPORT 1-35. Coordinate personnel support functions may fall under the purview of the G-1/AG and S-1; however, different staff officers or unit commanders at different echelons may perform them. These functions include command interest programs and retention operations. The following paragraphs provide a brief description of each subordinate key function of coordinate personnel support. Refer to chapter 5 for detailed information regarding each function. Command Interest Programs 1-36. Commanders at all levels are responsible for the establishment and execution of their command interest programs. Human resources professionals can serve as a staff principal to the commander to facilitate the successful accomplishment of some command interest programs based on command or echelon (for example, Voting Assistance). Retention Operations 1-37. The objective of retention operations is to improve readiness, force alignment, and maintain Army end-strength through the development and retention of Soldiers. While unit commanders and leaders are ultimately responsible for retaining Soldiers, HR professionals are charged with coordinating with career counselors (located at battalion and above organizations) who are technical experts in advising commanders on all aspects of the Army Retention Program. Human resources professionals assist career counselors in determining retention eligibility and options, and they assist with eligibility for special commissioning programs consistent with published regulations and DA directives. See AR 601-280, Army Retention Program, for detailed information regarding retention operations. SECTION II – OVERVIEW OF HR SUPPORT TO OPERATIONS 1-38. Today’s operational environment presents more complex challenges to the Army and joint force than any experienced in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army learned invaluable and enduring lessons during these conflicts that have culturally imprinted a generation of Army leaders and the institution for counterinsurgency and other stability operations. The Army and joint force are in a new era where the threat of large-scale combat is more likely than at any point since the end of the Cold War. To meet the challenges of this environment, the Army must prepare for the most lethal and challenging threat to our nation: the increasing likelihood of a highly contested great power conflict. This requires changes in how the Army mans, equips, trains, and employs the force, especially those forces at echelons above brigade. 1-39. Large-scale combat operations occur within a complex operational environment. An operational environment is a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander (JP 3-0). The operational environment shapes Army operations. The operational framework is a cognitive tool used to assist commanders and staffs in clearly visualizing and describing the application of combat power in time, space, purpose, and resources in the concept of operations (ADP 1-01). 1-40. Human resources leaders and professionals must analyze the operational environment using a framework of eight interrelated operational variables: political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, and time. Every unit and Soldier on the battlefield requires HR support. All HR core competencies and subordinate key functions must be able to take place during each of the Army strategic roles (operations to shape the operational environment, prevent conflict, prevail in large-scale combat, and consolidate gains). Our most critical wartime functions include––  Personnel accounting and strength reporting.  HR support to replacement operations.  HR support to casualty operations (reporting and tracking).  Postal operations.1-41. HR support to operations occurs in a non-stable environment beginning in the strategic support area and moves into the joint security area. Next, HR support to operations moves into the consolidation area Chapter 1 1-10 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 (corps and division support areas) where HR professionals establish operations and provide HR support to units executing missions in the close and deep areas (battalions and brigades) of the theater of operations. Figure 1-3 displays a notional operational framework of Army HR organizations and entities providing HR support to operations. Figure 1-3. Notional human resources operational framework THREATS TO HR SUPPORT 1-42. During LSCO, all friendly forces, including those providing HR support, should assume constant intrusion and observation efforts from the enemy in the cyberspace domain and information environment. Emerging threat weapons technologies place mission command systems at direct risk of disruption. Advanced informatics, data mining, and artificial intelligence enable threats to attack U. S. and coalition systems across domains. The enemy denies, degrades, and disrupts friendly communications networks as a central part of their operational concept. Human resources professionals should anticipate increased demand for readily available, dependable, accurate, and legitimate information to support sustainment operations. Enterprise resource planning systems such as current HR systems and the Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army (IPPS-A), necessitate a stable, reliable communications and digital information infrastructure that may not be present in LSCO. Training and routine practice on analog and manual systems and processes in a disconnected environment is essential to mitigate this risk. Human resources professionals should routinely incorporate purposeful training events to practice these techniques and develop others to ensure that, in the absence or degradation of HR systems and other technology, they can remain combat effective to accomplish assigned missions. 1-43. Human resources systems are essential in accomplishing Army-wide PIM execution during LSCO. Human resources professionals rely heavily on HR systems to provide commanders accurate reports and information for mission accomplishment. The inability to collect, process, and disseminate relevant HR information about units and personnel in a timely manner can seriously impede operations (or the commander’s mission). Human resources operations must be prepared to sustain the ability to support forces in degraded operations. Human resources leaders and planners should plan and train for the impacts of physical attacks, cyber-attacks, degradation, denial of service and displacement operations on their ability to Human Resources (HR) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 1-11 access HR systems to provide commanders with accurate and timely PASR (for example, planning for corrupted personnel status [PERSTAT] reports) and casualty reporting. 1-44. Considering potential adversary capabilities, HR leaders and planners at all echelons must maintain manual reporting formats and be prepared to operate in denied, degraded, and disrupted communication environments. In the event access to HR systems is denied, degraded, or disrupted, HR professionals must use alternative methods (for example, FM radio, telephone, messenger/courier) to manually manage PASR, replacement management, casualty reporting, and postal operations. EXTENDED BATTLEFIELD ENVIRONMENT 1-45. The interrelationship of air, land, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains require a cross-domain understanding of the operational environment. Human resources leaders and planners must understand friendly and enemy capabilities that reside in each domain, with emphasis on the cyberspace domain, and must assess potential impacts to HR support and system availability. Essential to HR operations, cyberspace is a global domain within the information environment consisting of interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers. Cyberspace includes friendly, enemy, adversary, and host-nation networks, communications systems, computers, cellular phone systems, social media, Internet, and technical infrastructures. As a contested domain, cyberspace is highly vulnerable for several reasons, including ease of access, network and software complexity, lack of security considerations in network design and software development, and inappropriate user activity. 1-46. Efficient and effective HR support increasingly depends upon the Department of Defense Information Network-Army to fulfill its role. Threats to the network include state and non-state actors, criminals, insider threats, and the unwitting individuals who intend no malice. A single vulnerability within this network can place units and operations at risk, potentially resulting in mission failure. Every individual is responsible for compliance with the proper practices and procedures for safeguarding information and information technology. See FM 3-12, Cyberspace and Electronic Warfare Operations, for more information on cyberspace operations, and AR 25-2, Army Cybersecurity, for additional information on Army cybersecurity. SECTION III – ARMY COMMAND AND SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS 1-47. Army command relationships define superior and subordinate relationships between unit commanders. The five Army command relationships are organic, assigned, attached, operational control, and tactical control. By specifying a chain of command, command relationships join efforts and empower commanders to use subordinate units and forces with maximum flexibility—for example, a division sustainment brigade (DSB) is assigned to the division. It is extremely critical to have HR support capabilities flexible enough to enable commanders in making important decisions and assessing risks. 1-48. When commanders establish command relationships, they determine if the command relationship includes administrative control (ADCON) when choosing which command relationship to establish. Administrative control is direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organizations in respect to administration and support (JP 1). Administrative control is not a command or support relationship; it is a Service authority. It is exercised under the authority of and is delegated by the Secretary of the Army. Typically, attachment orders state whether the parent unit retains ADCON of the unit. If not, the orders state ADCON belongs to the gaining unit. For operational control and tactical control relationships, parent units retain ADCON. See FM 3-0 for further information on administrative control. 1-49. Army support relationships are direct support, general support, reinforcing, and general support reinforcing. Army support relationships are not command authority and are more specific than joint support relationships (FM 3-0). Commanders establish support relationships when subordination of one unit to another is inappropriate. Commanders assign a support relationship for several reasons including when—  The support is more effective if a commander with the requisite technical and tactical expertise controls the supporting unit rather than the supported commander.  The echelon of the supporting unit is the same as or higher than that of the supported unit. For example, the supporting unit may be a brigade, and the supported unit may be a battalion. It would Chapter 1 1-12 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 be inappropriate for the brigade to be subordinate to the battalion; hence, the echelon uses an Army support relationship.  The supporting unit supports several units simultaneously. The requirement to set support priorities to allocate resources to supported units exists. Assigning support relationships is one aspect of command and control. 1-50. Army support relationships permit supporting commanders the ability to employ their units’ capabilities to attain necessary results by supported commanders. It is extremely critical to have HR support capabilities flexible enough to be closer to enable commanders in making important decisions and assessing risks about HR support or manpower. Support relationships do not alter ADCON. Commanders specify change support relationships through task organization. See FM 3-0 and FM 4-0 for further information on Army command and support relationships. HR AND THE SUSTAINMENT WARFIGHTING FUNCTION 1-51. For HR support, all HR functions and tasks integrate under the sustainment warfighting function. It is important for sustainment leaders and staffs to understand the HR and sustainment relationship as it relates to supporting and supported roles and responsibilities. Supported organizations include corps G-1/AGs, division G-1s, and brigade and battalion S-1s. Supporting organizations include the human resources operations center (HROC), theater personnel operations center (TPOC), expeditionary sustainment command (ESC) distribution management center (DMC) human resources operations branch (HROB), DSB and sustainment brigade support operations (SPO) HROBs, division sustainment troops battalion (DSTB) SPO, theater gateway personnel accountability team (TG PAT), military mail terminal (MMT), and HR companies. Figure 1-4 provides an overview of HR organizations and their relationship with sustainment units and supported units within a theater of operations. Figure 1-4. Human resources and sustainment structure relationship Human Resources (HR) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 1-13 1-52. Command and control is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission (JP 1). Command and control of all HR organizations is driven by mission variables. At higher levels, HR organizations are assigned or attached to sustainment units within the sustainment structure or operational units. For example, the TPOC is assigned to a theater sustainment command (TSC), and the TG PAT and MMT teams are attached to an HR company within the special troop’s battalion (STB) of a sustainment brigade. This command relationship further enhances the ability of the HR unit to accomplish its mission set, as the sustainment commander has the sustainment assets and resources needed for non-HR related support. Within the sustainment brigade, it is the commander’s decision to which subordinate unit the HR organization is assigned or attached. Commanders make task organization decisions based on the mission requirements. 1-53. Echelons above corps, such as the Army Service component command (ASCC) G-1/AG, focus on external and internal HR support, while subordinate echelon G-1/AGs and S-1s focus on internal support. The HROBs focus on external HR support within the ESC/DSB area of operations (AO). Human resources units’ standard requirements code (SRC) 12 are responsible for executing those external requirements (for example, postal missions and providing HR support to casualty operations and personnel accountability missions) that provides either direct or general support to the G-1/AG and S-1 at all echelons. Commanders are responsible for the training readiness authority and mission execution of assigned or attached HR organizations. Refer to Department of the Army Pamphlet (DA PAM) 71-32, Force Development and Documentation Consolidated Procedures, for information on SRC codes. Refer to ADP 6-0, Mission Command: Command and Control of Army Forces, for information on the fundamentals of mission command, command and control, and the command and control warfighting function. HR ROLES 1-54. The TSC is the senior sustainment organization for an area of responsibility (AOR). The TPOC is the key linkage between the Army Service component command (ASCC) G-1/AG and the TSC. The TSC provides centralized sustainment command and control of most deployed sustainment organizations and is responsible for planning, controlling, and synchronizing all operational-level sustainment operations for the ASCC or joint task force (JTF) during deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment. Within the TSC, the DMC is the center of gravity to sustain distribution within the theater. 1-55. The DMC in coordination with each commodity branch (to include the TPOC), develops the theater distribution plan for mail and examines current sustainment operations to ensure logistics and personnel services contribute to the desired effects of the supported commander. It also monitors and facilitates unit deployment/redeployment and reception, staging, onward movement, and integration (RSOI) activities. The DMC synchronizes supported commander requirements with distribution capabilities and tracks commodities to their destination. Figure 1-5 on page 1-14 depicts a DMC with an assigned TPOC. For specific information on the mission and organization of the TSC, DMC, and duties and responsibilities of the TSC/ESC G-1/AG, see ATP 4-94, Theater Sustainment Command. Chapter 1 1-14 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 Figure 1-5. Distribution management center with a theater personnel operations center 1-56. The ESC’s role is to execute command and control for task-organized units and to plan and synchronize current and future sustainment operations to support a corps HQ or an Army force. The ESC HQ is task organized with sustainment brigades and functional logistics organizations supporting unified land operations. The ESC G-1/AG’s focus is on ESC specific (internal) HR support, while the HROB’s focus is the AO in concert with the overall concept of support for sustainment. See ATP 4-94 for more specific information on the mission and organization of the ESC. 1-57. The sustainment brigade is modular and task organized to support theater opening, theater distribution, area sustainment, or life support missions. Organic to the sustainment brigade are the brigade HQ and an STB. All other assets are task organized to the sustainment brigade to enable it to accomplish its sustainment warfighting roles and mission. Sustainment brigades provide command and control and staff supervision of life support activities, and distribution management to include movement control as an integral component of the theater distribution system. For specific information on the mission, organization, and operations of the sustainment brigade, see ATP 4-93, Sustainment Brigade. 1-58. The DSB is assigned to a division. The DSB is responsible for the integration, synchronization, and execution of sustainment operations. The DSB, and its subordinate units, provide direct support to all assigned and attached units in an operational area as directed by the division commander and provides general support sustainment to non-divisional forces operating in the division AO. A DSB assigned to a division includes an organic DSTB and an organic division sustainment support battalion to support tactical-level sustainment operations. The DSB and its subordinate units must be able to move and displace at the pace of LSCO. 1-59. The HROB is an organic element within each sustainment brigade, DSB SPO section and ESC DMC. As previously discussed, the HROB has the mission to plan current and future operations, coordinate, integrate, and assess emplacement and operations of HR elements executing personnel accountability, HR support to casualty operations, and postal operations. This includes providing technical assistance to supported G-1/AGs and S-1s in personnel accountability, casualty, and postal missions. 1-60. The establishment of a close relationship between G-1/AGs, S-1s, and the supporting ESC, sustainment brigade, or DSB HROB is critical for timely support. The G-1/AG or the S-1 of the organization establishes Human Resources (HR) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 1-15 HR support requirements for subordinate or supported organizations within the theater and forwards the HR support requirements to the appropriate HROB. Once requests are received, the HROB evaluates the request against available resources and DSB unit priorities. If the sustainment brigade can provide the support requested, then it is coordinated with the HR company. If the request cannot be supported, it is forwarded to the ESC. The HROB recommends HR priorities of support to the sustainment commander. Human resources support requirements that cannot be resolved by the sustainment brigade or ESC/TSC are forwarded to the ASCC G-1/AG for prioritization and reconciliation. The ASCC G-1/AG, in coordination with the TSC (with the support of the TPOC), reconciles prioritization issues to ensure required HR support structure is available for the theater, within the ability of the Army to resource. SECTION IV – OVERVIEW OF HR SUPPORT TO UNIFIED LAND OPERATIONS 1-61. Unified land operations are the simultaneous execution of offense, defense, stability, and defense support of civil authorities across multiple domains to shape operational environments, prevent conflict, prevail in large-scale ground combat, and consolidate gains as part of unified action (ADP 3-0). Sustainment operations enable all phases of joint operations in each of the Army’s four strategic roles: shape the operational environment, prevent conflict, prevail in large-scale combat, and consolidate gains. This is skillfully accomplished by integrating and synchronizing resources from strategic through tactical levels. 1-62. Army operations to shape link activities intended to promote regional stability and establish conditions for a positive conclusion in the event of a military confrontation. The purpose is to set the conditions for successful execution of strategic plans. Global and theater shaping activities occur continuously.Army operations to prevent are an extension of operations to shape and include all activities intended to deter an adversary’s undesired actions, which contradict U.S. interest. Operations to prevent include actions to safeguard friendly forces and indicate the intent to execute subsequent phases of a planned operation. During LSCO, Army forces focus specifically is on defeating and destroying enemy ground forces a part of the joint team. Army operations to consolidate gains primary focus is to establish security in high threat areas and include activities to make enduring any temporary operational success and to establish conditions for a sustainable environment to the control of legitimate authorities. See FM 3-0 for more information on the Army strategic roles. 1-63. Army sustainment provides the support required to keep the Army and its unified action partners engaged in operations across the operational environment. It is a critically important requirement to ensure adequate HR support is in place for PASR, HR support to replacement operations, and HR support to casualty operations to enable the maneuver commander the ability to maintain operational tempo. If tempo is not maintained, the possibility of the defeat of friendly forces on the ground is increased. It is imperative for HR professionals to synchronize with operational planners in the planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of the operation because HR tasks and functions are conducted throughout all phases of joint operations in each of the Army’s four strategic roles. Note. Refer to chapter 7 of this publication for a detailed overview of HR support and planning considerations for each Army strategic role, by echelon, for conducting PASR, HR support to replacement and casualty operations, postal operations, and other HR considerations incorporated during LSCO. OPERATIONAL REACH, FREEDOM OF ACTION, PROLONGED ENDURANCE 1-64. The sustainment warfighting function is essential for conducting operations and generating combat power as the Army performs its strategic roles. Human resources support to unified land operations is a mission essential capability that creates strategic and operational reach, enables freedom of action, and provides the joint force prolonged endurance necessary to shape the operational environment, prevent conflict, prevail in large-scale combat, and consolidate gains. Chapter 1 1-16 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 OPERATIONAL REACH 1-65. Operational reach is the distance and duration across which a force can successfully employ military capabilities (JP 3-0). Depth is the extension of operations in time, space, or purpose to achieve definitive results (ADP 3-0). Depth and simultaneous operations are linked. Human resources organizations and entities must be able to simultaneously provide support across the breadth of an AO and to conduct support for more than one type of mission. 1-66. Army forces require significant sustainment to strike enemy forces and disrupt or destroy them throughout their depth, prevent the effective employment of reserves, and neutralize command and control nodes, sustainment elements, and other capabilities not in direct contact with friendly forces. Operations in depth disrupt the enemy’s decision and contribute to protecting the force by destroying enemy capabilities before the enemy can use them. Commanders balance their forces’ tempo and momentum to produce simultaneous results throughout their operational areas. To achieve simultaneity, commanders establish a higher tempo to target enemy capabilities located at the limit of a force’s operational reach. Generally, the higher the tempo of operations, particularly during LSCO, the greater the demand for sustainment. 1-67. Sustainment operations are critical to enabling operational reach. The Army’s sustainment capability assists in providing crucial theater and port-opening functions that further enable the strategic and operational reach of the joint force. Army sustainment capabilities continue to provide the bulk of Army support to other Services, common-user logistics, and other common sustainment resources to prevent friendly forces from culminating. 1-68. Facing a peer threat in LSCO requires the use of effective integration of all domains of warfare. To support maneuver commanders during LSCO, where heavy losses are expected, HR planners and leaders must properly plan for and allocate a continuous flow of non-unit related personnel (NRP) replacements to fulfill unit personnel needs. Non-unit related personnel replacements become the primary means of replacements because units will likely remain deployed for the duration of the conflict. Beyond personnel replacements, HR support is crucial for estimating casualties and maintaining PASR in all aspects of multi-domain operations. FREEDOM OF ACTION 1-69. Freedom of action enables commanders to achieve operational initiative and maintain operational tempo. Successful sustainment commanders facilitate freedom of action by planning and executing sustainment activities able to support the greatest possible number of courses of action for the supported commander in a situation. Effective sustainment execution provides continuous and responsive sustainment allowing supported commanders to operate freely. 1-70. Effective HR support enables freedom of action, especially with manning requirements. Proper manning allows maneuver units to support mission requirements and maintain flexibility to support LSCO. Sustainers enable freedom of action by conducting sustainment preparation of the operational environment, synchronizing the sustainment plan with the scheme of maneuver, and maintaining flexibility and disciplined initiative while supporting maneuver commanders. The proper application of the mission command philosophy to sustainment operations encourages the greatest possible freedom of action for subordinates. Appropriate sustainment unit command and support relationships equips subordinate commanders with the authority and flexibility to act boldly and achieve desired support effects in the absence of continuous direction from higher. PROLONGED ENDURANCE 1-71. Endurance refers to the ability to employ combat power anywhere for protracted periods. It stems from the ability to organize, protect, and sustain a force, regardless of the distance from its base and the austerity of the environment. Endurance involves anticipating requirements and making the most effective, efficient use of available resources. Endurance gives Army forces their campaign quality. It makes permanent the transitory effects of other capabilities. Being able to operate independently is extremely important to maneuver commanders. Human Resources (HR) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 1-17 1-72. Sustainment provides the support necessary to ensure operations continue until mission accomplishment. Sustainment also provides the capabilities necessary for maintaining the health of the force, as well as the personnel and materiel replacements essential to maintaining combat power. Sustainment support that enables prolonged endurance requires the synchronization of the elements of sustainment. ARMY EXECUTIVE AGENT RESPONSIBILITIES 1-73. Executive agent is a term used to indicate a delegation of authority by the Secretary of Defense or Deputy Secretary of Defense to a subordinate to act on behalf of the Secretary of Defense (JP 1). Executive agent refers to Secretary of Defense directives and instructions to the head of a DOD component (for example, the Secretary of the Army is the DOD executive agent for the military postal service [MPS]) to provide specific categories of support to other agencies or Service component. The Secretary of Defense designates and funds the Army as the executive agent for numerous DOD common support requirements. These DOD-level executive agent requirements relate to lead Service responsibilities. Executive agent reduces redundancy of common support requirements across the DOD. However, in many cases, lead Service requirements will be closely related to the DOD executive agent requirements. The combatant commander has the authority to assign the lead Service responsibilities for support that are not executive agent related to a Service. 1-74. The Secretary of Defense or the Deputy Secretary of Defense may designate an executive agent for specific responsibilities, functions, and authorities to provide defined levels of support for operational missions, administrative, or other designated activities involving two or more DOD components. The designation as an executive agent makes that organization responsible for a joint capability. SECTION V – OVERVIEW OF HR PLANNING AND OPERATIONS 1-75. Conducting comprehensive and well-coordinated HR planning is how HR leaders articulate HR operations and requirements to support the operational commander’s mission requirements. The military decision-making process (MDMP), rapid decision-making and synchronization process, and Army design methodology are commonly used planning methodologies which provide a framework to understand the situation and mission, develop a course of action (COA), and produce an OPLAN or operation order (OPORD) (ADP 5-0). The risk management process aligns with each of these processes to minimize the hazards/risk level and ensure decisions are made at the proper level of command. The successful planning of HR support identifies and communicates to subordinate HR professionals and unit leaders, the intent, expected requirements and achievable outcomes. HR PLANNING AND OPERATIONS 1-76. Effective HR planning and operations necessitate a comprehensive understanding of Army HR and sustainment capabilities. This understanding allows HR professionals to better anticipate requirements and inform commanders. Human resources professionals must recognize how to employ doctrine in any operating environment and be technically competent in the current HR systems, processes, policies, and procedures required to support Soldiers and commanders. 1-77. Human resources staff officers at every command level, starting with the battalion S-1, perform HR planning and operations. They are also conducted by the HROC aligned to the ASCC G-1/AG, corps G-1/AG, and division G-1 sections; the HROB within the ESC DMC, sustainment brigade/division sustainment brigade SPO, and DSTB SPO; the HR company; and all divisions within the TPOC. Human resources planning is a continual process supporting a commander’s ability to exercise command and control. It requires an understanding of how to deliver HR support in the operational environment and requires collaboration with other staff elements, HR planners, and HR providers to optimize HR support across operational lines. Refer to ADP 5-0, The Operations Process, for more information pertaining to the framework used to synchronize HR planning functions which include––  Plan – Develop plans that support the operational mission and provide commanders with options on how best to use HR assets within their organizations. The HR planner focuses on translating the commander’s visualization into a specific COA. Chapter 1 1-18 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Prepare – Prepare and set the conditions for success requires an understanding of the operating environment. Human resources professionals anticipate requirements and set into motion activities allowing the force to transition to execution.  Execute – Make execution and adjustment decisions to exploit opportunities or unforecasted requirements providing commanders with the flexibility required to be proactive.  Assess – Continual assessment allows HR professionals to learn and adapt as new information becomes available and provides a clearer picture of the operational environment. RUNNING ESTIMATE 1-78. To be effective in the planning process, the HR planner provides the HR running estimate. A running estimate is the continuous assessment of the current situation used to determine if the current operation is proceeding according to the commander’s intent and if planned future operations are supportable (ADP 5-0). Building and maintaining running estimates is a primary task of each staff section. The running estimate helps the staff provide recommendations to commanders on the best COA to accomplish their mission. Running estimates represent the analysis and expert opinion of each staff section by functional area. Throughout the operations process, maintain running estimates to assist commanders and the staff in the exercise of command and control. FM 6-0, Commander and Staff Organization and Operations, provides detailed information on the use of the running estimate in the planning process. Note: A forthcoming FM 5-0 (Planning and Orders Production) manual will become the Army’s reference for planning, which includes running estimates. This reference manual is programmed for an expected publication date of  September/October 2021. 1-79. Human resources information is contained in the sustainment estimate and HR planning considerations. Estimates may be needed at any time; therefore, running estimates must be continuously developed, updated, and maintained. An HR staff running estimate should include the following:  Facts relating to PASR, HR support to replacement operations, HR support to casualty operations, personnel readiness management, postal operations, and essential personnel services.  Assumptions relating to forecasts on readiness, replacements, casualties, postal, and personnel services.  Friendly force status (higher, lower, and adjacent units).  Conclusions and recommendations for future HR operations and COAs for command and staff awareness. HR PLANNING USING THE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS 1-80. The military decision-making process is an iterative planning methodology to understand the situation and mission, develop a course of action, and produce an operation plan or order (ADP 5-0). It is an orderly, analytical process integrating the activities of the commander, staff, and subordinate HQ in the development of a plan or order. The MDMP helps leaders apply thoroughness, clarity, sound judgement, logic, and professional knowledge to develop situational understanding and produce a plan or order that best accomplishes the mission. Each staff officer responsible for HR planning has an obligation to be thoroughly familiar with the MDMP. 1-81. The MDMP consists of seven steps. Each step of the MDMP has inputs, a series of sub-steps, and outputs. The outputs lead to an increased understanding of the situation facilitating the next step of the MDMP. Commanders and staffs generally perform these steps sequentially; however, before producing the plan or order, they may revisit several steps in an iterative fashion, as they learn more about the situation. The detail of each step is dependent on time, resources, experience, and the situation. Refer to FM 6-0 for additional information regarding the MDMP. Human Resources (HR) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 1-19 Note: A forthcoming FM 5-0 (Planning and Orders Production) manual will become the Army’s reference for planning, which includes the MDMP. This reference manual is programmed for an expected publication date of  September/October 2021. 1-82. The MDMP is a primary tool for commanders to solve problems, make decisions, and develop plans and orders. Human resources planners may adapt information collected and processed during the MDMP for their own organization’s purpose. Human resources planning is a continuous process in evaluating current and future operations from the functional perspective of the HR professional. Throughout the MDMP, the G-1/AG, S-1, and HR staff planner considers how the information impacts HR support to each phase of a military operation. When conducting HR support across the range of military operations, HR planners must consider the frequency of occurrence for HR tasks in each strategic role during LSCO (for example, shape the operational environment, prevent conflict, prevail in LSCO (defensive/offensive), and consolidate gains). During LSCO (defensive/offensive), units focus heavily on PASR and casualty reporting, while other tasks are accomplished as the situation permits. 1-83. To be effective in the planning process, it is important to position HR planners where they can not only track the current operation, but also influence the operation with additional HR support. Generally, at division and higher levels of command, elements of the G-1/AG section are in the sustainment cell of the main command post. Requirements stemming from operational situations for the G-1/AG section are determined by closely tracking the COP. For example, casualties monitored on the command voice or data network should prompt the G-1/AG and S-1 of the requirement to generate casualty reports, possible EPS actions (for example, awards and letters of condolence), and HR support to replacement operations necessary to replace casualty losses. By remaining engaged with the operation and maintaining situational understanding, G-1/AGs and S-1s can better support subordinate and/or supported units (HR and non-HR) in the execution of their HR mission. Similarly, HROBs must remain engaged and integrated with the ESC/sustainment brigade/division sustainment brigade/division sustainment brigade STB staff to influence HR support to supported organizations (G-1/AGs and S-1s) and to provide direction and guidance to the HR assets in their organization. HR INPUT TO OPERATION ORDERS 1-84. Human resources staff officers are responsible for providing input to the base plan/order, input to annex A, Task Organization, and writing portions of annex F, Sustainment, specifically appendix 2, Personnel Services Support. FM 6-0 provides the format and instructions for preparing an OPLAN and OPORD and integrates the sustainment warfighting functions. Note: A forthcoming FM 5-0 (Planning and Orders Production) manual will become the Army’s reference for planning, which includes plans and orders formats. This reference manual is programmed for an expected publication date of  September/October 2021. 1-85. Human resources planners, when developing their portion of the OPLAN and OPORD, ensure the following capabilities, units, and functions are addressed in the plan or order. Human resources planners recommend appropriate command relationships and support relationships for the HR specific units supporting the command and subordinates.Units, locations, and functional area support provided by a supporting unit should be addressed by HR support to annex A, Task Organization.

CASUALTY INPUT TO OPERATION ORDERS 1-89. Human resources support to casualty operations is a critical process in the operational environment. Human resources elements initiate the process through accurate casualty reporting. Units and HR organizations facilitate casualty reporting at all echelons. It must be included in all planning and OPORDs. The OPORD should contain all information needed to support efficient and timely casualty operations. Organizations should anticipate lethal effects during LSCO. As such, considerations regarding mass casualties must be included in OPLANs and OPORDs, as well as processing large-scale replacements. Units, locations, and functional area support provided by a supporting unit should be addressed by HR support to annex A, Task Organization. This includes, but is not limited to—  ASCC G-1/AG.  Field army G-1/AG.  Corps G-1/AG.  Division G-1.  HROC.  Brigade S-1.  Battalion S-1.  Theater casualty information center (CIC)–ASCC HROC.  HROB (ESC DMC and sustainment brigade SPO).  HR company HQ.  HR platoon (HR squads).  Mortuary affairs company.  Hospital center. 1-90. Assumptions include the following:  Degraded connectivity will drastically reduce casualty reporting capabilities in automated systems such as Defense Casualty Information Processing System (DCIPS).  Personnel asset visibility will be complex in the LSCO environment. The primary focus should be applying information from casualty reporting and operations to PASR and HR support to replacement operations. 1-91. Coordinating instructions include the following:  Identify casualty reporting and notification requirements and timelines.  Coordinate adequate connectivity for communications between HR squads, HROBs, the supported unit, and DCIPS.  Identify responsibilities and conditions for summary court martial officers and LOD investigations.  Determine HR squads’ locations.  Coordinate DCIPS training.  Identify posthumous awards, promotions, and ceremony procedures.  Identify rear detachment and family readiness group responsibilities.

POSTAL INPUT TO OPERATION ORDERS 1-92. Postal operations rely on a well-coordinated network to process mail and provide postal services within a theater of operations. It is an important combat multiplier and an essential consideration for military operations. It must be included in all planning and OPORDs. The OPORD should describe all information to support efficient postal operations including the significant logistics challenges of limited air and ground transportation available during LSCO. Postal units must have assured real-time communications by voice and data as well as securable transportation. It is the theater commander’s responsibility to determine at which point, in the Army’s role for LSCO, postal operations should begin. Additionally, planners should anticipate and prepare for the lethal effects of LSCO battlefields and adverse weather conditions affecting postal operations (for example, delayed transportation, increased mail backlog, and possible battle and weather damage). Units, locations, and functional area support provided by a supporting unit should be addressed by HR support to annex A, Task Organization. This includes, but is not limited to—  ASCC G-1/AG.  Field army G-1/AG.  Corps G-1/AG.  Division G-1.  HROC.  Brigade S-1.  Battalion S-1.  Theater personnel operations center (TPOC) postal operations division (POD).  Human resources operations branch (ESC DMC and sustainment brigade SPO).  Military mail terminal.  Human resources company HQ.  Postal platoon. 1-93.

Human resources organizations and staff elements are designed to be flexible and capable of providing and sustaining HR support across the range of military operations. SECTION I – OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC LEVEL HR SUPPORT 2-1. Strategic-level HR support centers on the shaping and implementation of effective military and civilian manpower policy, and HR policies and programs that build sustained personnel readiness across the Army. Such policies and programs enable department-level HR agencies and organizations to lead, direct, and manage Army HR activities, while working in collaboration with our partners within the human capital enterprise. Additionally, strategic HR support maintains oversight and direction for the Army's total force management, manpower and workforce management programs extending across the Army (for example, Active, National Guard, Reserve [military], civilian, and CAAF). Army HR management oversight and direction also extends to training, readiness and mobilization policies, plans and programs affecting the Army (Active and RC) with a strong emphasis on all policies and programs pertaining to mobilization, demobilization, and accessibility of the RC. 2-2. At the strategic-level, the Army G-1; Director, Army National Guard (ARNG); and Chief, United States Army Reserve (USAR) manage HR support for their respective component. The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) is responsible for the supervision of the manpower, personnel, and RC affairs for the Department of the Army. The Civilian Human Resources Agency, a field-operating agency of the Army G-1, is responsible for civilian personnel operations. The Army G-1 develops Army policy for all HR systems and functions, while the human resources command (HRC) applies and implements these policies for military personnel. The IMCOM and the MPSA provide strategic support to the force for MWR services and postal operations respectively. THE ARMY G-1 2-3. The Army G-1 is responsible for development, management, and implementation of all manpower and personnel plans, programs, and policies throughout the Army. The primary objective of the Army G-1 is to ensure readiness of its personnel to serve the needs of the Army across the range of military operations. As the principal for human relations of the U.S. Army, the Army G-1 is dedicated to supporting Soldiers, civilians, and families and leads programs that build sustained personnel readiness to support the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army. HUMAN RESOURCES COMMAND 2-4. The HRC is the U.S. Army’s manning enterprise that sets conditions for the Army by distributing personnel IAW Army priorities and readiness objectives to build and preserve the highest levels of unit and Service-level readiness. This direct reporting unit is the functional proponent of the Army G-1 for military personnel management (except for the judge advocate general and the chaplain branches) and HR systems. The HRC also supports the Director, ARNG and the Chief, USAR, in their management of the Selected Reserve.The HRC’s responsibility is to execute career management, sustainment, distribution, and transition of personnel to optimize Army personnel readiness, enable leader development, and strengthen an agile and Chapter 2 2-2 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 versatile Army. The HRC builds personnel requisitions based on strength, inventory, and Army manning guidance and fills positions as they are codified in official authorization documents. The HRC coordinates personnel replacements with the theater manpower and personnel directorate of a joint staff (J-1) and G-1/AG. 2-5. The Adjutant General Directorate is an organization within the HRC.

Human Resources Echelons, Organizations, and Staff Elements 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 2-5 Figure 2-1. ASCC G-1/AG with a human resources operations center FIELD ARMY G-1/AG 2-17. In theaters in which a peer threat exists, a field army is utilized to relieve the operational burden on the theater Army and facilitate focused opposition toward a specific threat within a distinct AO. Similar to the theater Army’s campaign across the AOR, the field army conducts an aggressive campaign of competition to counter and contain the peer threat as an integral part of the theater campaign. This unencumbers the theater Army and enables the integrated theater plan. While the theater Army continues to shape the entire theater and address aggression outside the field army’s AO, the field army maintains the necessary formations and other capabilities to provide credible deterrence and ensure the ability to quickly respond to escalation within the AO. 2-18. Field army G-1/AGs execute IAW ASCC policies and procedures in their respective AOR. They review and refine HR plans and manage PASR, HR support to casualty operations (reporting and tracking), and PRM as necessary to ensure they report timely and essential information to inform replacement priorities set by the ASCC. CORPS G-1/AG AND DIVISION G-1 2-19. Corps and divisions are the formations central to conducting LSCO.

BRIGADE S-1 2-28. The brigade S-1 is the principal staff advisor to the brigade commander for all matters concerning HR support. The function of the brigade S-1 section is to plan, provide, and coordinate the delivery of HR support, services, and technical direction to all assigned and attached personnel within the brigade and subordinate elements as well as provide technical direction. The brigade S-1 may also coordinate the staff efforts of the brigade equal opportunity section, brigade judge advocate, and morale, welfare, and recreation operations. 2-29. Corps and division headquarters and headquarters battalion S-1 sections are enabled and perform the same functions as a brigade S-1. Units are responsible for their own EPS and HR support as defined Human Resources Echelons, Organizations, and Staff Elements 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 2-9 throughout this manual. General Officer-level HQ, without a headquarters and headquarters battalion S-1 section or equivalent, must be augmented by their higher HQ for support in deployed areas. The G-1/AG section of these HQ do not have the capacity or resources to provide this internal headquarters and headquarters battalion S-1 support. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific duties and responsibilities of the brigade S-1 section. BATTALION S-1 2-30. The battalion S-1 is the principal staff advisor to the battalion commander for all matters concerning HR support including talent management. The battalion S-1 section plans, provides, and coordinates the delivery of HR support, services, and information to all assigned and attached personnel within the battalion. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific duties and responsibilities of the battalion S-1 section. THE ROLE OF THE ADJUTANT 2-31. While this manual discusses the tactical and technical functions in terms of core competencies and subordinate key functions, HR professionals must take into careful consideration the art of how to execute them. The role of the adjutant goes beyond a set of additional duties assigned to the S-1 based on tradition or expectancy. This most important tenant is found in the very root of the word adjutant, which in its literal translation means to help. The help or assistance rendered to a commander by the adjutant is the foundation of this relationship. 2-32. The adjutant is not a separate position or billet in an organizational structure but rather the dual role an individual performs. The function of the adjutant should not be confused with certain routine or specialized duties, which may be performed. Routine duties may include clerical work, scheduling management, and correspondence management. Specialized duties are coordinating activities to support commander programs and ceremonial duties. In each of these cases, the individual performing these tasks is often referred to as the adjutant, but in fact, it is the senior principal staff officer for HR who serves as the trusted agent to the commander on all sensitive and delicate matters related to HR. 2-33. The relationship established between the commander and the adjutant is critically important to the overall success of the HR mission. Each pairing is unique based on the commander’s needs. As the key advisor to the commander on all matters related to HR, the need for interpersonal skills and being perceptive cannot be overstated. The adjutant must be able to discern deeper meaning; to determine the true significance of what is being expressed. To achieve these ends, the adjutant must have access to the commander. Having access often exposes the individual to the commander’s unfiltered thoughts and feelings on sensitive matters. Discretion, empathy, and trust best describe the key attributes of any individual fulfilling this responsibility. 2-34. As the skills and knowledge required to serve effectively as an adjutant take time to master, it is important for senior HR professionals to continuously coach, teach, and mentor HR leaders in the art of HR support. This is especially important for HR leaders in geographically remote or austere locations. Anticipating the needs of an individual commander and then being able to act upon it with timely, accurate, and relevant information can only achieved through practice of the art. When executing the role properly, the adjutant minimizes mission distracters, allowing commanders to concentrate their efforts and decision making on core mission objectives. 2-35. The goal of a successful adjutant is measured in the overall effectiveness in linking the commander’s vision and intent to the optimal employment of the human capital to execute it. Ultimately, attributes such as trust, loyalty, discretion, and anticipation are critical to ensuring the S-1’s success in the adjutant role. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific general duties commonly performed by the adjutant. ARMY BANDS 2-36. Army bands promote the Army and our national interests, enable commanders to shape the environment to accomplish their mission, and set the conditions that lead to trust and confidence in America’s Army and its readiness to conduct operations in peacetime, conflict, and war. Army bands flexibility and versatility enable performances by using a full band or small teams. These teams allow commanders to meet strategic and tactical goals while simultaneously fulfilling home station requirements. Army bands are Chapter 2 2-10 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 designed to support joint, interagency, and multinational operations, providing broad flexibility to use customized music performances to fulfill deployed and home station mission requirements. Through these music performances, Army bands boost Soldier resilience, morale, and esprit de corps. Refer to ATP 1-19 for detailed information regarding band support during LSCO, Army bands structure, and rules of allocation. 2-37. Army bands have a variety of resources with which to accomplish musical support missions. Army bands are task organized into music performance teams that offer the flexibility to support concurrent musical missions in multiple geographical areas. The teams are identified by their additional skill identifier organization and provide an array of situationally and culturally appropriate performances. Army bands can concurrently support deployment operations and home station missions. This permits commanders to spread the positive impact of Army bands across the deployed force, to the military and their families, the American public, and the international community. Deployed bands may support the rear detachment with a music performance team. In this circumstance, musical support is generally limited to providing military or patriotic music for static ceremonies, protocol functions, family readiness group functions, and religious and hospital support activities. Army bands based in the U.S. and its territories continue to provide music support of Army recruiting and deliver targeted messaging during overseas contingency operations. 2-38. Army bands have two standard structures as described below—direct support and general support bands. Special bands are an exception and are structured differently. Both direct support and general support bands have administrative and musical support functions, a ceremonial marching band, and multiple musical performance teams that provide both concurrent independent musical support capabilities to the installation and surrounding community, as well as increased collective capabilities when combined.  Direct support bands are intended to meet the needs of a single command, at an installation and geographical area with local or specific support responsibilities.  General support bands are intended to meet the needs of multiple collocated commands that have regional support responsibilities, high density of troop and other service populations to be supported, and a greater density of civilian and retired military population. THEATER PERSONNEL OPERATIONS CENTER 2-39. The TPOC (formerly human resources sustainment center) is a multi-functional organization (staff element), and theater-level center assigned to a TSC. The TPOC consists of a HQ section and three divisions: the personnel accountability and systems division, the synchronization and integration division, and the POD. In coordination with the TSC, the TPOC plans, integrates, and sustains HR and Soldier support systems for the theater/ASCC HQ and other echelons as directed by the theater/ASCC G-1/AG or as determined by mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations (METT-TC). It is responsible for planning, coordinating, and synchronizing theater opening HR operations with the senior sustainment HQ and the ASCC. The TPOC supports the TSC in the execution of early entry reception operations.

It develops and maintains TPOC internal plans and policies for training. The division manages TPOC internal deployment plans, physical security and contingency operations, as well as assists the theater G-1/AG with internal mission support and planning support operations, as directed by the TSC. The synchronization and integration division provides support to planning and coordinates support with the ASCC HROC, TG PAT, and ESC/sustainment brigade HROBs for theater-level reception and meeting the ASCC’s replacement prioritization and redeployment operations. It monitors and analyzes projected personnel flow rates for various transit categories for deployers and redeployers to resource and provide recommendation to position theater personnel accounting assets. The division ensures TG PAT structures are established and resourced to perform personnel accounting and data integration as part of the RSOI process. 2-43. The postal operations division establishes the deployed AO postal inspection plan to ensure compliance with USPS and DOD regulatory guidance and coordinates theater-level training for MPO representatives. It assists the ESC HROB in the establishment of theater opening postal operations. The division monitors and determines appropriate mail flow rates and ensures current data integrates into all TSC/ESC distribution management center planning. The POD oversees the MMT technical mission and provides assistance in the area of postal operations. It makes recommendations to adjust postal support based on battlefield operations and TSC priorities to meet the ASCC commander’s intent. The division maintains a clear line of communication with the MMT as the executive arm for mail operations. The POD establishes and provides oversight for casualty mail and redirect services. It manages the theater EPW mail and plans and monitors the execution of this mail. The POD appoints the theater postal supply officer and theater postal finance officers to coordinate all theater-level postal supplies, equipment accountability, and ordering as well as accounting for all postal monies for each APO within theater. The POD provides manpower to support the directory service function covering casualty mail and detainee mail operations, inspections and international mail.It enforces policies established for casualty mail and redirect services. The POD assists the HROB as necessary in the coordination of theater-level mail transportation for mail movement. Refer to chapter 4 of this publication for specific responsibilities of the TPOC POD. 2-44. The TPOC is dependent upon the TSC headquarters and headquarters battalion for administrative support, to include uniform code of military justice; religious; medical; legal; HR; administrative services; quarters and rations; logistics; unit maintenance of organic equipment; supplementary transportation support; and military pay. The TPOC relies on non-secure, secure, continuous, and survivable communications and digital information systems. HUMAN RESOURCES OPERATIONS BRANCH 2-45. The HROB is a critical sustainment (SRC 63) planning and coordinating element on the battlefield for the delivery of personnel accountability, postal, and casualty support. The HROB is an organic section of the ESC DMC, sustainment brigade, and DSB SPO with the mission to plan current and future HR operations, coordinate, synchronize, integrate, and assess the emplacement and operations of HR companies, platoons, and teams executing personnel accountability, postal operations, and HR support to casualty operations. The HROB is the key integrator between G-1/AGs, casualty, personnel accounting, and postal organizations (through subordinate SPOs) to support the execution of subordinate key functions. The HROB synchronizes personnel movement with equipment and platforms and coordinates with the appropriate DMC or SPO sections for distribution and transportation to units based on the supported commander’s established priorities. Chapter 2 2-12 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 2-46. During theater opening operations, the HROB deploys as an element of the ESC DMC, and sustainment brigade SPO section, focusing on the establishment of the personnel accounting portion of the RSOI process along with initial postal and HR support to casualty operations. The HROB receives technical guidance from the TPOC and operational guidance from sustainment command channels. Technical guidance includes mission analysis, determining best methods of support, and passing the requirement to the HR element for execution. If noncombatant evacuation operations occur within an area the HROB is overseeing, they can coordinate with their assigned HR companies to assist in operations where feasible—for example, personnel accountability support and provide technical guidance and coordination with local brigades to ensure accountability of noncombatants. For further guidance on noncombatant evacuation operations, refer to Joint Publication (JP) 1-0, Joint Personnel Support and JP 3-35, Deployment and Redeployment Operations. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for detailed organizational functions and responsibilities of the HROB, and for specific information on the ESC and sustainment brigade commander’s Key Performance Indicators for HROBs. THEATER GATEWAY PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY TEAM 2-47. The TG PAT is attached to an HR company within the sustainment brigade assigned the theater opening mission. It provides personnel accounting support to the AOR by coordinating and providing personnel accounting operations using the Tactical Personnel System and DTAS as personnel enter, transit, and depart the theater at inter-theater ports of embarkation and debarkation. The TG PAT deploys as part of the theater early entry element and is initially augmented by an HR company HQ with at least two HR platoons at the primary inter-theater APOD. More than one TG PAT may be required if multiple inter-theater aerial ports and/or sea ports of embarkation become active. Units entering and departing theater with unit integrity will leverage self-accounting capabilities resident in the S-1 staff sections but must coordinate with the TG PAT for integration of unit personnel into the theater database. Human resources squads may be allocated to multiple theater entry points to perform the personnel accounting mission in place of a TG PAT if transit numbers outside of supported units do not exceed 600 personnel daily. 2-48. The TG PAT receives technical guidance from the TPOC personnel accountability and systems division and the supporting HROB. The TPOC’s personnel accountability and systems division monitors and recommends distribution and emplacement of HR squads to perform the personnel accounting mission. The HROB monitors the establishment and operations of HR squads at forward locations. The HR company HQ provides command and control as well as administrative and operational support to the TG PAT and forward operating HR squads. 2-49. The TG PAT requires a capability to communicate digitally through web and voice, both secure and non-secure, to HR formations with personnel accountability elements, G-1/AG sections, logistical support elements, and other branches of Service. Operational guidance and directives are initiated by the TSC (TPOC) and should be issued in OPLAN or OPORD format. Theater gateway personnel accountability teams are global force pool units of operational forces. In support of the readiness model, TG PATs are typically categorized as theater available structure, deployed under combatant command authority and established for the primary purpose of fulfilling global operational requirements of both an enduring and rotational nature. Theater gateway personnel also coordinate with other Services and other supporting units for operating space at the terminal, flight schedules with movement control teams, and inform the sustainment brigade of follow-on transportation requirements to assist in synchronizing all logistical support. The TG PAT is a technical section that is subordinate to the HR company commander. The company commander is responsible for executing the TG PAT mission with the assistance and expertise of the TG PAT section. 2-50. The TG PAT also provides data integration support for all personnel transiting the theater or at intra-theater processing points where an HR squad with a personnel accounting mission is located. To support unit S-1s during RSOI and redeployment operations, the TG PAT has the capability to perform limited EPS (for example, processing CACs, updating the DD Form 93, SGLV 8286, and SGLV 8286A). Any other sustainment requirements for life support (for example, billeting, feeding, equipping, and transportation of transient personnel) are conducted by units such as the regional support group or the sustainment brigade. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for detailed organizational functions and responsibilities of the TG PAT. Human Resources Echelons, Organizations, and Staff Elements 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 2-13 MILITARY MAIL TERMINAL 2-51.

The MMT, with an HR company and four postal platoons coordinates, receives, and processes prograde mail, and dispatches retrograde mail to destinations worldwide. With specialized postal expertise, the MMT team establishes and provides the Army component of a joint MMT team at the inter-theater APOD. 2-52. The MMT team initially deploys with the sustainment brigade with a theater opening mission to establish the MMT or joint MMT. As the theater matures the MMT team and supporting HR company transition to a theater distribution role. The MMT team receives technical guidance through the TPOC POD, service postal manager (SPM), and MPSA, and technical assistance from the HROBs. The MMT team operates under the operational control of the sustainment brigade during a theater opening mission and the operational control of the land component command in a mature theater. The sustainment brigade SPO section and HROB provide support to mission operations. The MMT is a technical element subordinate to the HR company responsible for executing the MMT mission. It ensures all functions of the MMT are within regulatory standards. Human resources companies and their subordinate elements (HR and postal platoons; TG PAT and MMT when performing those missions) operate under the guidance and direction of the STB commander. 2-53. The MMT team consists of an HQ section, operations section, and two postal squads. The TPOC POD serves as the senior Army postal element for all technical matters. The HQ section provides a direct link with other Services for operating space at the terminal, flight schedules, and ground transportation of mail. It also provides a single joint operations area-level executor with the expertise to support the ASCC and TSC commander. The operations section is the vital link for all theater postal operations planning and implementing all necessary input from the other Services and guidance from the MPSA into OPLANs in-conjunction with the ASCC. The operations section is the operational interface between the MMT and HROBs for coordinating the distribution of mail and related postal transportation requirements within the AO. As the MMT does not have assigned transportation assets, it coordinates transportation support through the HROB section of the sustainment brigade SPO. 2-54. Equipment is crucial to the success of MMT functions. All heavy postal equipment for the AO is associated with the MMT team. Equipment includes rough-terrain container handlers and 10-k forklifts to move bulk mail in and out of the APOD. Satellite phones, radios, and the Combat Service Support Automated Information Systems Interface connectivity provides the necessary communication link to control mail movements from the continental United States (CONUS) to and throughout the AO.

The postal platoon provides postal support for up to 6,000 personnel in an assigned AO or serves in an augmentation role to support an MMT. Postal platoons operate in-conjunction with the plans and operations section within an HR company. The postal platoon can perform the complete spectrum of postal functions including postal services, postal finance, and postal operations. This includes processing incoming bulk mail and outgoing mail to CONUS. The postal platoon receives all technical guidance through the HR company HQ and the HROB or MMT. The HR company HQ provides command and control of postal platoons.Note: All postal platoons must be trained on and capable of conducting personnel accounting functions (with additional access and equipment – for example, scanners) as needed during operations. Limited SRC 12 HR structure and available resources will require this multi-functional capacity, especially during early entry and theater opening operations for LSCO. Postal platoons must be able to perform these functions until HR units are in theater and operational. 2-66. The postal platoon consists of an HQ section, postal finance section, and two postal squads. The HQ section provides command and control, leadership, and resourcing. The postal finance section provides retail services at the same level of support provided by the USPS in CONUS, and current level of support in garrison. Each postal squad has the capability to perform operations or services missions or to perform independently as needed as a mobile mail team. In addition to these functions, each postal squad trains, tests, and certifies unit mail clerks and inspects each unit mailroom quarterly. Postal platoons are equipped with variable reach forklifts to provide efficient mail movement in whatever type of area the platoon is supporting. The postal platoon requires secure and non-secure web and voice digital communications to the HR company HQ, logistical support elements, G-1/AGs, and S-1 sections of units in the supported area. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for detailed organizational functions and responsibilities of the postal platoon.

Man the force ensures there is an uninterrupted flow of Soldiers to the battlefield and accurate accounting for all Soldiers, DOD and DA Civilians, and CAAF. Properly manned units are vital to assuring the fulfillment of missions as a strategic element of national policy, enhancing predictability, and ensuring commanders have the people necessary to perform assigned tasks. Man the force key functions are PRM, PASR, HR support to replacement operations, HR support to casualty operations, and is supported by PIM. 3-1. Man the force influences the effectiveness of all Army organizations, regardless of size, and may affect the ability to accomplish all other HR core competencies and subordinate key functions. Man the force is any action or function affecting strength or readiness of an organization. This HR core competency combines anticipation, movement, and skillful positioning of personnel so the commander has the personnel required to accomplish the mission. 3-2. Human resources professionals rely on HR databases and systems to accomplish man the force functions. The enduring principles of timeliness and accuracy are paramount in man the force because data integration occurs at multiple levels with multiple systems used by decision makers up the chain of command and at the national HR provider level (for example, the HRC and the Army G-1). Human resources providers must take ownership of data they control to eliminate or reduce errors affecting man the force functions. Man the force includes five subordinate key functions:  Personnel readiness management.  Personnel accounting and strength reporting.  HR support to replacement operations.  HR support to casualty operations.  Personnel information management. SECTION I – PERSONNEL READINESS MANAGEMENT 3-3. The mission of PRM is to distribute Soldiers and Army Civilians to subordinate commands based on documented manpower requirements or authorizations and the commander’s priorities. Personnel readiness describes a state of wartime readiness; PRM is a process for achieving and maintaining that state. Personnel readiness management involves analyzing personnel strength data to determine current combat capabilities, project future requirements, and assess conditions of unit and individual readiness. Personnel readiness management in formations starts by comparing the organization’s personnel strength against its requirements or authorizations and ends with a personnel readiness assessment and allocation decision. By adding predictive analysis of manpower changes (non-deployable rates, projected casualty rates, evacuation policies, and replacement flows), units can assess the personnel readiness of the organization and determine replacement allocation priorities. 3-4. Personnel readiness management is directly interrelated and interdependent upon the functions of PASR and PIM. In support of the Army’s sustainable readiness model, the national HR provider (for example, HRC, Army Reserve, and National Guard Bureau) determines individual replacement packages based on forecasted losses and allocated to units IAW HQDA manning guidance. The manning levels for units are Chapter 3 3-2 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 established by the Army (HQDA) G-3/5/7, which identifies target fill levels. See AR 525-29, Force Generation – Sustainable Readiness for more information on the sustainable readiness model. 3-5. The G-1/AG and S-1 manage unit personnel readiness, and recommends changes to the priority of replacements. The decision to change the priority of replacement fills is made by the commander after receiving a recommendation by the staff. 3-6. Personnel readiness managers continuously collect, correlate, and analyze critical personnel strength information to develop a vision of future requirements. Personnel readiness managers must ensure the staff is integrated and ensure the G-1/AG participates in planning and is integrated into current operations to provide an assessment of future personnel requirements. From this assessment, personnel readiness managers maintain a running estimate and make recommendations to commanders during the MDMP. Critical MOS shortages or large numbers of non-deployable Soldiers, for example, are not easily overcome once a unit is alerted for deployment. Battalion and brigade S-1s are the key to success in the PRM process. The battalion is the first level of command responsible for updating duty status changes or non-deployability data in the appropriate HR system of record. Unforecasted losses, such as those resulting from administrative, legal, or medical issues, can significantly impact unit readiness. If losses cannot be mitigated by initiating appropriate measures, such as cross-leveling personnel from the installation/unit or reorganizing unit personnel, then elevation of the issue to the next higher command is appropriate. PERSONNEL READINESS MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES 3-7. The paragraphs below outline the PRM responsibilities at various echelons of command. ASCC G-1/AG 3-8. During the planning phase of operations, the ASCC G-1/AG identifies unit and personnel requirements, to include deployed CAAF and DOD and DA Civilian personnel. The ASCC G-1/AG is responsible for a casualty estimate and replacement plan as part of the deliberate planning process. The peacetime replacement system requires the ASCC commander to submit personnel requisitions to include civilians in advance of requirements. At OPLAN execution, the system delivers replacements to the theater to bring units to required strength and ensure replacements are available as casualties occur. The requisitions reflect the number of Soldiers by MOS/area of concentration and grade needed to bring theater units to required strength and to replace the number of expected casualties (killed-in-action, wounded-in-action, missing-in-action, non-battle injuries) by MOS/area of concentration/rank and by time window. Casualty estimates are produced by the Medical Planners’ Toolkit (MPTk), which is the Army’s only authorized casualty estimation program for echelons above brigade. To support this effort, ASCC G-1/AG, assistant chief of staff, intelligence, G-3, G-4, and G-5 planners, at a minimum, develop the casualty estimate, and in coordination with the G-3, work with HQDA to determine the ratio of individuals versus unit replacements. Individual replacement requirements are submitted to the HRC, which maintains a copy of the ASCC’s individual replacement requirements for each concept plan/OPLAN. The HRC maintenance of the ASCC individual replacement requirements includes a review for consistency with HQDA manning guidance, MOS, and area of concentration structure changes. The ASCC G-1/AG PRM responsibilities include—  Develop theater PRM plans, policies, milestones, and priorities, synchronized with operational objectives included in OPLANs and OPORDs.  Advise the commander on theater PRM.  Obtain, monitor, and assess the PRM (strength reports, projected gains, estimated losses, and projected numbers of personnel returning to duty) of theater units via DTAS and various HR systems feeding from the Total Army Personnel Database (TAPDB) information.  Determine personnel requirements and recommend priorities by skill and rank.  Provide approved NRP replacement priorities to the TPOC.  Direct intra-theater reassignments to meet urgent operational requirements.  Obtain RTD data from the surgeon cell or theater CIC and incorporate into the NRP distribution plan.  Prepare the casualty estimate in coordination with the surgeon using MPTk; provide the casualty estimate to the G-3. Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-3  Monitor the personnel portion of ongoing reconstitution efforts. CORPS G-1/AG AND DIVISION G-1 3-9. Corps G-1/AGs and division G-1s maintain overall responsibility for PRM of subordinate elements. Corps G-1/AGs and division G-1s maintain the responsibility to assist the national HR provider in shaping the force to meet mission requirements. Corps G-1/AG and division G-1 PRM responsibilities include—  Establish the personnel requirements reporting system in the corps.  Ensure PRM SOPs are synchronized with ASCC PRM policies and procedures.  Manage PRM for subordinate units, to include task-organized units in a deployed theater and home station.  Advise the commander on current and projected personnel status.  Monitor the personnel portion of ongoing reconstitution operations.  Collect, consolidate, analyze, and report unit strengths.  Validate replacement priorities for displaced units.  Determine NRP replacement priorities (based on G-3 priorities to ensure personnel distribution management supports the operational plan).  Coordinate diversions as required.  Manage subordinate unit assignment priorities to ensure they meet the commander’s guidance.  Obtain and prepare casualty estimates leveraging the MPTk in coordination with the surgeon.  Coordinate and monitor RTD projections with the surgeon.  Include PRM (and the casualty estimate) in OPLANs and OPORDs.  Establish electronic link to HR systems.  Manage PRM for non-deployed personnel.  Maintain and monitor the status of key combat leaders and request replacements when required.  Recommend cross-leveling corps and division assets as required.  Conduct assessment of PRM using strength reports, projected RTD reports, and information contained in various HR systems, retrieved and analyzed using various data sources. Include gains, losses, and estimates not included in strength reports.  Assess new equipment and weapons systems' impact on personnel requirements.  Perform the duties of the ASCC G-1/AG if serving as the Army Force or JTF. BRIGADE AND STB S-1 (GENERAL OFFICER-LEVEL HQ) 3-10. The brigade or STB S-1 maintains communication and coordination with the higher-level G-1/AG for the execution of its PRM responsibilities, which include—  Collect and correlate critical personnel readiness information.  Manage PRM for subordinate units.  Develop unit-level PRM policies and SOPs.  Establish and execute brigade/STB PRM and distribution fill plan, and coordinate modifications based on operational requirements or commander’s priorities.  Verify the accuracy of manning status in subordinate units.  Recommend, in coordination with the battalion or brigade operations staff officer (S-3), replacement priorities based on current and forecasted readiness status and commander’s intent.  Distribute NRP (individual replacements) to subordinate units based on the commander’s priorities and publish orders.  Monitor and advise the commander on the personnel readiness status (current and projected) of subordinate units to include key leaders, critical combat squads, crews, and teams.  Predict personnel requirements, based on current strength levels, projected gains, estimated losses, and the projected number of Soldiers and Army Civilians returning to duty from MTFs. Chapter 3 3-4 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Monitor losses (for example, combat, non-combat, legal actions, medical, Military Occupational Specialty Administrative Retention Review [MAR2], and referrals to the Disability Evaluation System).  Monitor and maintain visibility of non-deployable Soldiers, to include rear detachments.  Coordinate the call forward of replacements.  Monitor the personnel portion of reconstitution operations.  Manage Soldier readiness processing (SRP) to validate individual readiness and ensure visibility through updates to appropriate systems and databases. Manage Soldier utilization; distribute and properly slot Soldiers within the brigade/STB.  Report critical personnel requirements to higher for individual Soldiers and/or teams.  Manage unit identification code hierarchies through various databases to ensure an accurate readiness COP at all levels.  Ensure PRM is included in all OPLANs and OPORDs. BATTALION S-1 3-11. The battalion S-1 implements the priorities of fill established by the commander by conducting and executing PRM for the unit. This includes PASR, managing casualty information, monitoring projected gains and losses, and managing RTD Soldiers (in coordination with the medical platoon). Battalion S-1s directly influence PRM by ensuring the accuracy of a Soldier’s status in the appropriate HR system of record. Personnel readiness management starts with complete, accurate, and timely Soldier data updates at the battalion. Battalion S-1 section responsibilities include—  Develop unit-level PRM policies and SOPs.  Collect and correlate critical personnel readiness information.  Ensure timely and accurate updates in the HR system of record for all required personnel data, strength, and duty changes.  In coordination with the battalion S-3, recommend replacement priorities based on current and forecasted readiness status and commander’s intent.  Monitor and report to the commander the personnel readiness status (current and projected) of subordinate units to include: key leaders, critical combat squads, crews, and teams.  Predict and report personnel requirements, based on current strength levels, projected gains, estimated losses, and the projected number of Soldiers and Army Civilians returning to duty from MTFs.  Monitor losses.  Monitor status of non-deployable Soldiers.  Monitor the personnel portion of reconstitution operations.  Manage SRP to validate individual readiness and ensure visibility through updates to appropriate systems and databases.  Report critical personnel requirements for individual Soldiers and/or teams.  Assign individual, squad, crew, or team replacements IAW the commander’s priorities.  Ensure PRM is included in all OPLANs and OPORDs. PERSONNEL DISTRIBUTION LEVELS 3-12. The G-1/AG and S-1 rely on various HR systems and databases for strength related information. Figure 3-1 depicts the personnel distribution levels based on senior mission command readiness levels. The Army has four distribution levels:  Senior mission command-level. Management of grouped units under the same command at a specific location.  Distribution management-level. Management of division-level or two-star command equivalent organizations. Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-5  Distribution management sub-level. Management of brigade or colonel command equivalent organizations.  Virtual Distribution Management-Level. Strength management categorization of grouped units that would otherwise take a combination of distribution management level and distribution management sub-level codes. Figure 3-1. Personnel distribution levels 3-13. The G-1/AG and S-1 at all levels assist commanders in developing their personnel priorities.The use of HR systems provides G-1/AGs and S-1s a COP with the national HR provider and allows G-1/AGs and S-1s the ability to provide a detailed analysis to the commander. Brigade S-1s work with higher headquarters to fill authorized vacancies and develop personnel distribution plans within their organization. The G-1/AG at all levels maintains situational understanding of competing priorities and assist brigades, higher headquarters, and the national HR provider when shifting priorities, changes in operational plans, or other unforeseen events create situations where the personnel fill for an organization is no longer in synchronization with Army manning guidance. The G-1/AG is responsible for attempting to resolve subordinate command manning issues internally before involving higher echelons. 3-14. The personnel distribution plan allows G-1/AG and S-1 sections to know where to assign incoming Soldiers. Based on the mission, a brigade S-1 may maintain different fill levels for subordinate units, which may not be consistent with their authorized manning level. Key considerations for developing the personnel distribution fill plan include––  Commander’s priorities.  Unit personnel readiness reports, tactical SOPs, OPLANS, and related plans and reports.  Replacement forecasts as well as casualty and RTD estimates. Lessons learned from deployments highlight the need for S-1s to manage these Soldiers as they often return from different roles of medical support, both within theater and from locations outside theater.  Critical shortages by grade, additional skill identifier, special qualification identifier, MOS, and area of concentration.  Changes to OPLANs and OPORDs. Chapter 3 3-6 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Specific manning requirements for squads, crews, and teams.  Timelines for exercises, train-up, and deployment. CASUALTY ESTIMATION AND REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS 3-15. The Army G-1 is the functional proponent for overall casualty estimation (killed-in-action, captured, missing-in-action, and wounded-in-action, disease and non-battle injury) and coordinates with the Army Surgeon General for Army evacuation rates to support projected manning requirements. Replacement requirements consist of killed-in-action and evacuated Soldiers not RTD, prisoners of war, and missing-in-action. Casualty estimation is conducted at ASCC-level and above as part of the planning process for contingency operations and approved by the combatant commander. Casualty estimates should also be conducted at levels below the ASCC for specific operations and to provide better fidelity in personnel replacement and medical requirements for planners at those echelons. Casualty estimation is always conducted in collaboration with the other staff planners. 3-16. Human resources planners require close coordination with the ASCC G-1/AG/HROC theater CIC, as well as the SPO officer in the TSC, ESC, DSB, and sustainment brigade concerning casualty estimates and replacement requirements to ensure HR planners properly synchronize efforts with logistics and medical planners. Casualty estimates support operations planning, future force planning, and staff training. Casualty estimation and replacement requirements are planned during COA development to assess force strength for missions within the concept of operations and scheme of maneuver to establish communications and electronic interface for personnel accounting and patient tracking early and enable timely and accurate information, especially during LSCO. 3-17. Mass casualties must be included in the planning process, as well as processing large-scale replacements. The ASCC G-1/AG must continuously coordinate with corps and divisions for proper replacement allocation of replacement seats in the time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD). During LSCO, planners must consider a large sustained rate of casualties. Specific estimates are established by the ASCC during the planning process. These casualties will vary in severity of injury and represent killed-in-action, wounded-in-action, and disease and non-battle injuries. Due to a portion of injured Soldiers being RTD, Army HR planners should anticipate having to replace only a portion of the total casualties and any prisoner of war or missing-in-action personnel based on approved casualty estimates. 3-18. The ASCC G-1/AG is responsible for developing replacement requests, as part of the deliberate planning process. For those requirements that are not sourced with unit replacements, the HRC assists Army commands in developing NRP force packages by using a reinforcement sourcing process. This process guides collectively trained Soldiers in crews, teams or squads to combat in a manner that preserves their morale and fighting spirit, benefiting them and the units they join. ACHIEVING REALISTIC CASUALTY ESTIMATES 3-19. Ensuring realistic casualty estimates is critical to the planning and resourcing of replacement operations. The MPTk is the only approved casualty estimation tool and consists of a suite of tools combined into a single desktop application. It supports the joint medical planning community and provides users with a means of estimating required replacements by MOS and pay grade. The medical planning tools within the MPTk used for deriving casualty estimate rates for operational planning are the Patient Condition Occurrence Frequency Tool, Casualty Rate Estimation Tool, and the Expeditionary Medical Requirements Estimator. Used collectively, these tools provide data and versatility to enhance medical planning efficiency. As these planning tools are medical focused versus HR focused, certified operators will receive in-depth training on the usage of these tools. 3-20. The Patient Condition Occurrence Frequency Tool provides a means to estimate the probability distribution for illnesses and injuries that may occur across the range of military operations, based on empirical data and expressed in international classification of disease codes. It allows the user to store, edit, export, import, and manipulate these distributions to better fit planned operations. The tool generates precise, expected, patient probability distributions. These mission-centric distributions include combat, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief. Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-7 3-21. The Casualty Rate Estimation Tool provides the capability for planners to emulate the operational plan to calculate the combat and non-combat injuries and illnesses that would be expected during military operations. Casualty estimates can be generated for ground combat, ship attacks, fixed facilities, and natural disasters. Patient streams are based on the casualty estimate and the user selected Patient Condition Occurrence Frequency Tool distribution. The Casualty Rate Estimation Tool uses stochastic methods to generate wounded-in-action and killed-in-action estimates and can therefore provide quantile estimates in addition to mean value estimates. 3-22. The Expeditionary Medical Requirements Estimator estimates the operating room, intensive care unit bed, ward bed, theater evacuations, and blood product requirements for theater hospitalization based on a given patient load. Patient loads are based on a user specified average daily patient count or patient streams derived from the Casualty Rate Estimation Tool. The Expeditionary Medical Requirements Estimator uses stochastic processes to allow users to evaluate risk in medical planning. It also stratifies the rate by MOS and pay grade distribution to enable the planning and resourcing for replacement operations. RECONSTITUTION 3-23. Commanders should prepare for greater losses to personnel, supplies, and equipment in their formations because of the highly destructive nature of LSCO. Even with continuous and effective sustainment support, units may rapidly become combat ineffective because of enemy action. Commanders at all levels must be prepared to conduct reconstitution efforts to return ineffective units to a mission capable status as quickly as possible to meet campaign objectives. 3-24. Reconstitution operations are actions planned and implemented by a commander to restore attrited units’ combat effectiveness commensurate with the mission requirements and available resources. Reconstitution should be considered when the operational pace, mission, or time, or demand does not allow normal replacement operations to restore combat power. Reconstitution restores combat power to the levels necessary, within a limited time to continue the fight. This restoration is beyond the capabilities and available time of normal day-to-day sustainment action. Reconstitution requires both generating and operating force involvement. Key considerations for reconstitution operations are: combat readiness of the unit, mission requirements, risk, and the availability of replacements. Commanders must decide what type of reconstitution effort would be best for the organization based on METT-TC. 3-25. Reconstitution is not a sustainment operation, although sustainment plays an integral part. All sustainment functions are executed during reconstitution. It is not simply about replacing equipment; HR, medical, supply, and maintenance personnel work closely with maneuver forces to rebuild combat power. Personnel readiness management is a critical factor in the reconstitution process. Personnel readiness managers and HR planners at all levels must understand the concepts of reconstitution and plan to support commanders in their efforts to sustain combat power. 3-26. Reconstitution encompasses two major efforts–reorganization and regeneration. Reorganization is the expedient cross-leveling of internal resources within an attrited unit in place to restore necessary combat effectiveness as directed by the unit commander. Regeneration is the rebuilding of a unit and requires time and resource intensive operations which includes equipment repairs/replacements, supply replenishment, mission essential training, and personnel replacements IAW theater commander guidance. REORGANIZATION 3-27. Reorganization is action to shift resources within an attrited unit to increase its combat effectiveness. Commanders of all types of units at each echelon conduct reorganization. Reorganization may be conducted when the operational tempo is such the risk for removing a unit from the operation may jeopardize the mission. There are two types of reorganization operations: immediate and deliberate. The type of reorganization operation executed is based on mission variables. Both types of reorganization may include such measures as cross-leveling personnel and equipment, matching operational weapon systems with crews, and forming composite units (joining two or more attrited units to form a single mission-capable unit). Chapter 3 3-8 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 Immediate Reorganization 3-28. Immediate reorganization is the rapid and usually temporary restoration of attrited units to minimum levels of effectiveness. Normally, the commander implements immediate reorganization in the combat position or as close to that site as possible to meet near-term needs. Immediate reorganization consists of cross-leveling personnel and equipment, matching weapon systems to crews, or forming composite units (joining two or more attrited units to form a single-mission capable unit). Deliberate Reorganization 3-29. Deliberate reorganization is conducted when more time and resources are available. It usually occurs farther away from hostile activity than immediate reorganization. Deliberate reorganization procedures are similar to those for immediate organization; however, some replacement resources may not be available. In this case, equipment repair can become intensive making more extensive cross-leveling possible. REGENERATION 3-30. Regeneration is the intentional restoration of unit’s combat power and is considerably more resource intensive than reorganization. It is also time intensive and normally requires days to weeks to execute. Regeneration is an extraordinary action and requires large-scale replacement personnel, equipment, and supplies. It may involve reestablishing or replacing the chain of command and conducting mission-essential training to get the regenerated unit to a required readiness standard. Because of the intensive nature of regeneration, it occurs at a designated regeneration site after the unit disengages from combat operations. The regeneration site is normally situated in a relatively secure location away from the battlefield, but still most conducive to regenerate combat power under the constraints of time and geography. 3-31. The Individual Replacement System and the Small Team Replacement System (4-9 Soldiers) is used during replacement operations to resource both reorganization and regeneration. Commanders may elect to regenerate a unit after assessing it as combat ineffective. It is unique in two specific ways. First, it is the only form of reconstitution that does not occur in contact with the enemy. Second, it requires establishing a regeneration task force to oversee the rebuilding of the regenerated unit’s command structure and manage resources as the regenerated unit’s command, staff, and tactical competencies are restored. The command of a unit receiving reinforcements or reorganizing retains autonomy, but a regenerated organization requires readiness validation before returning to mission. If units are severely degraded that they may not be regenerated, then personnel and equipment are reassigned as part of the replacement system and the unit’s heraldry is returned to the strategic support area for rebuilding as a part of the force generation process, or permanently retired. SUSTAINABLE READINESS OVERVIEW 3-32. The Army must sustainably generate ready and responsive forces over time to enable their projection and employment as an essential part of joint and combined forces necessary for the effective execution of unified land operations. The Army uses sustainable readiness to inform, synchronize, and integrate force generation tasks and processes at strategic, operational, and tactical levels across the near-, mid-, and long-term. Sustainable readiness does this by providing the Army a common set of processes, models, and mindset that seek to maximize opportunities to build and maintain decisive action readiness at all times. Sustainable readiness operates on the understanding that a modern military force necessitates the integration of force generation elements and readiness attributes across key DOD and Army-wide processes down to the unit-level to sustainably build and maintain force readiness. 3-33. Sustainable readiness encompasses the planning, preparing, execution, and assessment of the Army’s force generation process. Sustainable readiness informs the Army’s resource decisions to maximize both mission and response readiness of the total Army force to meet known, emergent, and contingent requirements for the Army forces. The execution goal of the sustainable readiness process is to meet the readiness objectives agreed to by the Army’s senior leadership. These readiness objectives are developed during sustainable readiness planning and preparing phases and are informed by the readiness requirements placed upon the force as well as the resources available. Sustainable readiness must focus on increasing and maintaining unit personnel, supply, readiness, and training rating, maximizing the use of available resources. Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-9 Sustainable readiness reflects an Army mindset change to being ready all the time, thereby achieving readiness consistent with current military strategy, threats to national security, and resourcing levels. For detailed information regarding sustainable readiness, refer to AR 525-29, which describes Army policy for its force generation operations and processes, and establishes policy for its sustainable readiness process to provide ready and responsive forces necessary for the effective execution of unified land operations. 3-34. Within the process, Army command and elements of the Army staff are integrated to better leverage and inform those existing enterprise-level decision-making forums and build force readiness. To achieve this, the sustainable readiness process projects an accurate operational demand enabling the Army to meet ordered current operations (known requirements) and mitigate the risk to respond to significant emergent or large-scale contingency operations (contingency requirements). Sustainable readiness provides Army senior leaders with the appropriate information to make resource investments needed for appropriate and predicable readiness outcomes, and an analytic framework for balancing near-term readiness requirements with the need to man, equip, and modernize a force for the future. SOLDIER AND UNIT READINESS 3-35. Successful unit readiness begins with outlining specific steps G-1/AGs and S-1s must complete to be prepared for deployment. The time for G-1/AGs and S-1s to plan Soldier and unit readiness activities is continual to ensure units and individuals are prepared to deploy if notified. Soldier and unit readiness includes––  All subordinate units, even those not scheduled to deploy.  Individuals identified to support rear detachment or home station operations as they may be called forward.  Functions of PASR, individual readiness, replacement of non-deployable personnel, and PRM. It also includes legal, financial, medical and dental, family support, and Soldier well-being matters. 3-36. As part of the planning process, G-1/AGs and S-1s determine how to execute PRM in various operational settings. Some of these factors include––  Size of the deployed force.  Size of the stay behind force and the rear detachment (if any).  Length of deployment (if known).  Personnel manning requirements.  Connectivity at the forward location.  Number of replacements expected at home station. 3-37.AR 600-8-101, Personnel Readiness Processing, outlines the Soldier readiness program to ensure Soldiers meet readiness criteria for deployment. The program prepares, certifies, and reports individual Soldier and unit readiness for deployment, including shortfalls, to the unit commander. Each organization (brigade and battalion) should include the Soldier readiness program in their unit SOPs. The G-1/AG and S-1 must clearly outline the pre-deployment process and the expectation for commanders. Units should also advise their higher HQ and the HRC of the process to ensure there are no conflicts associated with commanders’ expectation versus higher HQ and the HRC direction. For additional information regarding individual medical readiness requirements, refer to AR 40-502, Medical Readiness, and DA PAM 40-502, Medical Readiness Procedures. 3-38. Individual Soldier readiness for deployment is just as important as training and equipment readiness. This requires active discussions on issues and priorities with the commander, G-3/S-3, chief of staff, executive officer, and command sergeant major. Improperly planned HR support affects the commander’s ability to make manning decisions based on personnel and the readiness and morale of the forces deployed. For deploying units, validation is the senior commander’s determination of the unit’s ability to accomplish the deployment mission. The garrison chief, military personnel division is the military personnel community’s representative on the installation validation board. Per AR 600-8-101, the process for validation is typically conducted in three phases:  Phase I – The unit commander’s unit status report suffices as the initial assessment. Commanders will no longer report the available status of personnel as it relates to unit readiness reporting, but Chapter 3 3-10 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 will instead report the deployable status of all personnel through the Army’s readiness reporting system as it relates to unit personnel readiness status. Units will measure personnel readiness using three metrics: total deployable strength, assigned MOS skills match, and the deployable senior grade composite-level.  Phase II – Soldier readiness processing accomplishes the readiness improvement portion of the validation process and ensures all Soldiers meet the readiness requirements.  Phase III – The deployment processing activities described in AR 600-8-101 provides information for the installation final validation assessment and deployment decision-making process. 3-39. Upon notification of deployment, initial efforts must be concentrated in the following areas:  Accountability for assigned and attached personnel. This is crucial as personnel may be on temporary duty (TDY), attending school, or in authorized leave status. If required, the S-1 may recommend the commander recall personnel on TDY, attending non-DA sponsored schools, or in an authorized pass or leave status. Submit all requests to recall personnel attending DA sponsored schools through the chain of command to HQDA.  Verify the non-available status of all Soldiers and update required databases as required.  Initiate reassignment actions for Soldiers who remain non-available for the duration of the deployment.  Cross-level personnel within the unit as necessary.  Coordinate RC cross-levels from external RC donor units to include the Individual Ready Reserve. 3-40. Other pre-deployment actions include–  Support or coordinate PRM requirements for deploying units.  Ensure the HRC has the correct distribution management sub-level mapping for deploying units.  Publish a unit schedule and conduct SRP IAW AR 600-8-101, chapter 5.  Complete DA Form 7425 (Readiness and Deployment Checklist).  Conduct a deployment brief for unit personnel and their spouses.  Coordinate appropriately with the family readiness group leaders.  Coordinate issuance of CACs for DOD and DA Civilians and CAAF before deployment.  Request HQDA, DCS, G-3/5/7 Force Management, to establish derivative unit identification codes (DUICs) for PASR of personnel not deploying. Units can also use the codes as an interim placement until replacement personnel are assigned to a specific unit.  Ensure rear detachment HR support is established for the period of the deployment.  Ensure the rear detachment obtains access and permissions to the appropriate HR systems and databases.  Confirm all S-1 personnel are trained on HR systems and databases.  Coordinate with supporting medical and dental activities (for example, medical records review for immunization requirements, verify the panographic dental X-Ray and the deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA sample is on file, and verify profiles of medically disqualified personnel via the Medical Protection System).  Verify Soldier financial readiness.  Update Soldier data elements affecting pay.  Review and update Soldier records, with attention to data elements affecting deployable status.  Ensure the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System correctly reflects the DD Form 93 and Service members’ Group Life Insurance Certificate of Coverage.  Coordinate with the appropriate staff section for preparation of Isolated Personnel Reports.  Verify S-1 personnel security clearances.  Identify required evaluation reports.  Verify CAC and ID tags; replace or reissue as required.  Coordinate legal services, wills, and powers of attorney. Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-11  Ensure training and certifications completion for all assigned rear detachment sergeant first class through sergeant major, chief warrant officer/CW2, and captain through colonel, for casualty notification and assistance officers.  Be familiar with fatal incident requirements and briefing responsibilities per AR 638-34, Army Fatal Incident Family Brief Program. 3-41. The S-1 should provide the S-3 with the unit's incoming gains roster to designate times and resources for theater specific individual readiness training. This coordination and execution before departure will directly affect a unit's deployed strength. 3-42. Battalion S-1s coordinate with the unit commanders to ensure they closely monitor medical readiness programs routinely. The non-deployable categories increasing the most before deployment are temporary and permanent profiles and referrals to the MAR2/Medical Evaluation Board/Physical Evaluation Board. Battalion S-1s should reinforce to unit commanders the need for them to monitor their Soldiers continuously to ensure they complete their regular birth-month medical checks. These checks are a precautionary step in identifying medical conditions and correcting them before deploying. Battalion S-1s should encourage commanders to make decisions on Soldiers who are borderline for deployment as early as possible. If deployability decisions are made just before deployment, there may be insufficient time for brigade S-1s to work replacements before deployment. Below are common medical boards and programs that involve S-1s:  MOS Administrative Retention Review (MAR2). An administrative board authorized under AR 635-40, Disability Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, or Separation, but not part of the Disability Evaluation System. It is held for Soldiers whose medical condition(s) are determined by the appropriate medical authority to meet the medical retention standards in chapter 3, AR 40-501, Standards of Medical Fitness, but nonetheless require duty limitations necessitating a P3 profile. The MAR2 evaluates whether the profile limitations prevent the Soldier from satisfactorily performing primary MOS or area of concentration duties in a worldwide field or austere environment. The MAR2 evaluation may result in retention in primary MOS or area of concentration, reclassification, or referral to the Disability Evaluation System.  Medical Evaluation Board. The Medical Evaluation Board is an informal process conducted IAW AR 635-40 which is phase 1 of the Disability Evaluation System. The designated medical authority refers Soldiers directly to the board when the Soldier has reached the medical retention determination point for a condition(s) that individually or in combination fails the medical retention standards of AR 40-501, chapter 3. Per AR 635-40, the Disability Evaluation System begins as of the earliest approval signature of the DA Form 3349 (Physical Profile); thus, a Soldier is in the system before the completion of the Medical Evaluation Board. When a MAR2 evaluation results in a referral to the Disability Evaluation System, the Soldier is in the system as of approval of the MAR2 decision. The Medical Evaluation Board cannot return a MAR2-referred Soldier to the Disability Evaluation System unless the board upgrades the Soldier’s profile to a P2 or P1, in addition to confirming the Soldier’s condition(s) meet medical retention standards.  Physical Evaluation Board. The Physical Evaluation Board is conducted per AR 635-40. An informal Physical Evaluation Board initially adjudicates all cases, which is essentially a paper board. In accordance with 10 USC 1214, no Soldier may be separated without a full and fair hearing if the Soldier demands one. The full and fair hearing is the formal Physical Evaluation Board. Board findings are not final until approved by the U.S. Army Physical Disability Agency for the Secretary of the Army. Certain cases require higher-level approval.  Warrior Transition Unit. Personnel undergoing medical care and rehabilitation may be assigned or attached to a warrior transition unit. Warrior transition units are for Soldiers with complex medical needs requiring six months or more of treatment or rehabilitation. Commanders must clear uniform code of military justice actions, other legal actions, investigations, property/hand receipt issues, and LOD determinations before transferring Soldiers to a warrior transition unit.  Community Based Warrior Transition Unit. The community based warrior transition unit functions as a warrior transition unit for Soldiers who receive medical care in their community at DOD or Department of Veterans Affairs health care facilities. Community based warrior transition units primarily provide outpatient care management and transition services for USAR and ARNG Soldiers who do not need day-to-day medical management provided by warrior transition units on Army installations. Community based warrior transition units perform command and control Chapter 3 3-12 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 functions, and provide administrative support, medical case management, and medical processing for assigned Soldiers. Regular Army Soldiers may be attached to a community based warrior transition unit on a case-by-case basis. 3-43. Commanders and leaders at all levels have the responsibility to build and sustain individual resilience and unit readiness within their formations. It is critically important to identify any Soldier readiness issues and address them immediately. Responsibility and accountability lie solely on unit commanders for ensuring readiness is maximized at the unit-level continually. The SRP team from installation and staff agencies supports both unit and individual annual SRPs under the general leadership of the directorate of plans, training, mobilization, and security. Based on installation or community size and mission, the team may operate full time and consist of representatives from specific installation or community staff agencies. These agencies include but are not limited to––  Personnel.  Medical.  Dental.  Provost Marshal Office.  Military pay.  Security.  Legal.  Logistics.  Operations.  Transition Assistance Program Center. 3-44. As directed by AR 220-1, Army Unit Status Reporting and Force Registration – Consolidated Policies and DA PAM 220-1, Defense Readiness Reporting System-Army Procedures, Army units report their combat readiness each month on the unit status report. This document identifies the status of personnel, supply, equipment, and training readiness. It informs HQDA of current factors degrading the unit’s readiness and helps commanders at all levels to allocate resources, determine trends, and identify authorizations versus the unit's wartime requirement. The personnel data portion reflects the unit's percentages on assigned strength, available strength, available senior grade, available MOS qualified strength, personnel turnover rate, total non-available personnel by category, and the unit’s overall personnel rating. MANAGEMENT OF DERIVATIVE UNIT IDENTIFICATION CODES 3-45. Derivative unit identification codes must be registered in the Defense Readiness Reporting System-Army database; otherwise, S-1s will not be able to view authorization reports. The Defense Readiness Reporting System-Army is the Army’s official unit status reporting database and the authoritative database of record and central registry for all approved Army units, organizations and installations. The DUICs are used in HR systems to identify units and their teams, as well as split-unit elements associated with a parent organization (battalion or brigade units). The DUICs are assigned to organic elements of organizations that require separate UIC registration. Split-unit elements are physically located away from the parent organization. The DUICs also have a PRM replacement function because assignment and efficient distribution of inbound NRP to DUICs is expected. 3-46. The DUICs are also used to assign a different unit identification code from the parent unit to elements that remain at the unit’s home location under the purview of the unit commander when the commander and a portion of the unit deploy. Under the DUIC, the rear detachment accounts for non-deploying personnel assigned to rear detachment during a deployment to receive replacements and to maintain property accountability. The DUIC is inactivated when the unit redeploys to the home-station and may be maintained for future use. 3-47. Rear detachment Soldiers are referenced with a rear detachment code on the commander’s unit status report. Commanders use the remarks column in the unit status report to provide additional details on Soldiers’ rear detachment code. The Defense Readiness Reporting System-Army Portal lists and explains rear detachment codes. The codes only apply to deploying and deployed units, and are only used to indicate the reason(s) that a Soldier who is assigned or attached to a deploying or deployed unit will be or remains in the Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-13 rear detachment. The codes replicate those established and used in electronic Military Personnel Office (eMILPO) for use by deploying or deployed units in the rear detachment reports submitted separately to Army personnel managers. Unit commanders use their remarks to clearly explain why any available Soldier will be or is in the unit’s rear detachment. 3-48. Brigades have a responsibility for self-managing the use of their own DUICs. To ensure Soldiers are assigned to the correct location, HR leaders and S-1s must reconcile all unit identification codes and DUICs monthly. SECTION II – PERSONNEL ACCOUNTING AND STRENGTH REPORTING 3-49. Soldier accountability is the responsibility of commanders at all echelons during peacetime, mobilization, combat, and other types of deployments. Deployment encompasses all activities from origin or home station through destination, specifically including intra-continental United States, inter-theater, and intra-theater movement legs, staging, and holding areas. Various HR accountability and strength reporting resources are used for this process. The objective of PASR is to account for Soldiers, military members of other Services, DOD and DA Civilians, and CAAF; report other strength-related information, such as duty status, unit of assignment, and specialty codes; and update HR databases and systems at all levels. Information gained through PASR provides personnel readiness managers the details necessary to analyze personnel strength as a component of combat power. This information is also used by other HR leaders to plan and provide HR support. The following paragraphs discuss the responsibilities of PASR. Refer to AR 600-8-6, Personnel Accounting and Strength Reporting, for detailed information regarding policies, standards, and requirements for performing PASR. 3-50. Personnel accounting is the reporting of by-name data on Soldiers, DOD and DA Civilians as they arrive and depart units, and management of the location and duty status of every person assigned or attached to a unit. The Army’s personnel accounting system, eMILPO, accounts for joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational personnel when directed and eligible family members during noncombatant evacuation operations. Strength reporting is a numerical end product of the personnel accounting process.It is achieved by transforming the by-name data into a numerical end product that, when compared to unit authorized strength, drives Army readiness and personnel readiness. 3-51. Personnel accounting is one of the most important functions a battalion or brigade S-1 performs on a continual basis, regardless of location or environment. Data accuracy is critical to the personnel accounting process. Promptly entering personnel accountability changes is crucial to providing commanders, strength managers, and manpower analysts at HQDA a correct strength picture of the Army and individual units. Personnel accounting is the key factor used for conducting strength reporting. 3-52. Personnel accounting includes the by-name recording of specific data on arrivals and departures of personnel from their units, duty status or grade changes, assignment eligibility and availability codes, and MOS/specialty codes. It is extremely important for battalion and brigade S-1 HR professionals to be competent in using HR systems and databases and to understand the personnel accounting reporting process. 3-53. The personnel accounting process is crucial to the Army’s entire PIM system. Not only is personnel accountability maintained by units, but also as personnel enter, transit, and depart theater. Currently, the HR Authorization Report located in eMILPO serves as the source document for battalion and brigade S-1s, reflecting the slotting of assigned personnel. Other personnel accounting tasks include––  Account for military personnel individually in DTAS, IPPS-A, eMILPO, and Regional Level Application Software.  Collect, process, and sort personnel accounting data about Soldiers, CAAF including other theater designated contractor personnel, and DOD and DA Civilians.  Track and account for transiting personnel in DTAS. 3-54. The Army uses DTAS in a deployed environment and is the official database of record for personnel accounting for all assigned or attached military Services. It provides HR professionals and commanders at all levels with a tool to accurately account for and report military and DOD and DA Civilians. The Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) is the DOD enterprise system that provides personnel accounting for CAAF and other designated contractor personnel in an operational area. In the event Chapter 3 3-14 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 DTAS and SPOT systems are not available for any reason (for example, denied network) reports such as the personnel status report, also commonly referred to as the PERSTAT report, must be completed manually. Personnel status reports are snapshots taken in time to account for each unit’s personnel in a standardized format so that it can easily be transmitted via voice if necessary and so that it is compatible in a joint/multinational environment. Refer to FM 6-99, U.S. Army Report and Message Formats, for the Army’s standardized PERSTAT format for all units. 3-55. Personnel strength reporting is a command function conducted by G-1/AGs and S-1s to enable analysis of manning levels and readiness, which provides a method of measuring the personnel component of combat power. As strength reports impact tactical decisions during LSCO, the timely and correct duty status of individuals are critical to the strength reporting process. Strength reporting includes reporting all personnel who deploy with the force. This includes Soldiers, military personnel from other Services, DOD and DA Civilians, and CAAF personnel. 3-56. The strength reporting process is performed at all echelons of the Army command structure, to include unit S-1s processing strength related transactions into various HR systems, which drives Army readiness and personnel readiness and ends with the production of a PERSTAT report (joint PERSTAT in a joint environment). This report can be either manual or automated. Timely updating of data is gained in the strength reporting process by generating reports from HR systems performing personnel accounting functions. Data must be reconciled to be consistent between personnel accounting enabling systems to increase data accuracy. Additionally, automated processing is capable of simultaneous versus sequential reporting, which provides greater responsiveness to HR professionals and their commanders. 3-57. The strength reporting process provides commanders with a snapshot of the personnel component of their unit’s combat power and capabilities. Within a deployed theater, the ASCC G-1/AG establishes PERSTAT reporting requirements for unit strengths to include required as of times. When operating in a joint environment, the joint PERSTAT contains similar data elements as the PERSTAT. 3-58. The PERSTAT should not include local nationals, foreign national contractors (unless specifically theater designated as CAAF), or detainees. The PERSTAT or joint PERSTAT provides boots on the ground numbers and reflects all civilians (DA and DOD and CAAF including other theater designated contractor personnel) and all military personnel from each Service assigned, attached, or under operational control and present in theater of operations at the time of the report. 3-59. The use of command and support relationships in personnel strength reporting operations must be clearly understood by the losing and gaining S-1 section, to ensure there is no double counting of task organized units. Unless stated otherwise in orders, strength reporting requirements follow the ADCON command relationship reporting lines. The most common discrepancy with strength reporting is the double counting of units the day of a change in task organization. Effective date and time groups for task organization changes are critical to reporting timelines and the as of data reflected in strength reports. Battalion and brigade S-1 sections maintain operational awareness for task organization changes and ensure strength reporting reflects task organization changes. The S-1 must communicate laterally to ensure the gaining and losing S-1 is clear on reporting conditions. Figure 3-2 depicts the PASR reporting process and the PASR information flow. Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-15 Figure 3-2. Personnel accounting and strength reporting flow 3-60. For contractor personnel, the DOD designates the SPOT as the enterprise system to manage and maintain by-name accountability of CAAF and other designated contractor personnel in the AO. The tracker is a web-based application allowing authorized users to view, input, and manage contractor personnel pre-deployment, accountability, and location data. 3-61. Contractor personnel accounting includes using SPOT to identify, capture, and record the personal identification information and assigned location of individual contractor employees. Without such information, it is impossible to integrate CAAF into military operations, especially when it comes to determining and resourcing government support requirements such as facilities, life support, force protection, and Army Health System support in hostile or austere operational environments. Contractor personnel accounting information can also be aggregated and used to provide commanders contractor personnel visibility. Contractor personnel visibility includes information on the location, movement, status, and identity of contractor personnel, which facilitates the capability to act upon that information to improve overall performance of contracted support to the mission. 3-62. Commanders maintain accountability of Army Civilians, CAAF, and AAFES and ARC employees assigned or attached to support contingency operations. The CAAF coordination cell, attached to the Army field support brigade (AFSB), assists in establishing and maintaining the tracking and accountability of all CAAF and other contractors as directed. The AFSB logistic branch uses SPOT and the Joint Asset Movement Management System to accomplish their CAAF accountability and tracking missions, and incorporates contractor numbers in their reports to the TPOC and ASCC G-1/AG. The ASCC G-1/AG is responsible for developing PASR policies for contractors. The TPOC, G-1/AGs, and S-1s execute these policies. The G-1/AG monitors the personnel accountability process to ensure subordinate units are executing it properly. Refer to ATP 4-98, Army Field Support Brigade, and ATP 4-10/MCRP 4-11H/NTTP 4-09.1/AFMAN 10-409-O, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Operational Contract Support, for additional information on SPOT and CAAF accountability. KEY TERMINOLOGY 3-63. Listed below are key terms commonly used in personnel strength reporting:  Assigned Strength includes all Soldiers currently assigned on orders to the unit; however, the Soldier’s duty status may vary. Chapter 3 3-16 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Attached strength includes attached units and Soldiers in the personnel strength report of the gaining commander (attached units are fed; housed; armed; receive replacements; mail; and so forth, by the gaining commander). Commanders (S-1s) of attached units provide the gaining HQ personnel data on their Soldiers, normally in an electronic format. The next higher HQ that own both units provide the attachment orders.  Authorized Strength includes unit peacetime requirements; the number against which personnel assignments are made and can normally be found on a unit’s modified table of organization and equipment or an RC unit’s mobilization/deployment order, may be directed by the personnel manning authorization document.  Operating Strength reflects the number of Soldiers who are available to deploy as compared to authorizations. This relates to available strength on the unit status report and does not include Soldiers who are non-deployable or not available.  Personnel Requirements Report lists unit personnel replacement requirements by grade and MOS, and is based on comparison of authorized versus assigned strength. The standard information source at all echelons is the HR system of record. If that source is unavailable, units must prepare reports manually.  Personnel Summary Report displays a unit’s personnel strength in aggregate numbers as of a given time. It reports strength by personnel category (officer, warrant, enlisted, civilian, and CAAF), gains, losses, and duty status changes since the last report. Commanders and personnel readiness managers use the report to assess organizational combat power and set priorities.  Required Strength includes unit wartime requirements found on a unit’s modified table of organization and equipment or an RC unit’s mobilization/deployment order.  Task Organization includes military forces, units, and individuals grouped under one command for the accomplishment of a specific operation or assignment. PERSONNEL ACCOUNTING AND STRENGTH REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES 3-64. The following paragraphs outline the PASR responsibilities at various echelons of command. ASCC G-1/AG 3-65. The ASCC G-1/AG PASR responsibilities include––  Deploy individuals as part of the early entry element to manage and monitor personnel accounting as part of the early entry module.  Establish personnel strength reporting plans and policies reflecting detailed reporting procedures, timelines, formats and responsibilities (who reports to whom), in coordination with the JTF/joint force land component command/combined force land component command J-1.  Establish connectivity with the HRC, RC personnel offices, rear detachments (as required), appropriate joint HQ/other Services/federal agencies, and continental United States replacement center (CRC).  Collect, reconcile, correlate, analyze, and present critical PASR information to the ASCC commander and personnel readiness managers.  Conduct reassignments to meet operational requirements (coordinate with subordinate G-1/AG and S-1s and the HRC).  Assist with a directed Personnel Asset Inventory for any subordinate unit when the unit’s strength imbalance between eMILPO, Regional Level Application Software, IPPS-A, and the TAPDB is two percent or more or when DTAS and unit PERSTATs are out of balance IAW theater policy.  Manage and maintain ASCC personnel strength reporting information.  Prepare and maintain PERSTAT or joint PERSTAT, personnel summaries, and personnel requirements reports.  Monitor, analyze, and validate unit strengths to recommend replacement priorities to the ASCC G-3. Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-17  Predict and validate personnel requirements based on current strength levels, projected gains, estimated losses, and the projected number of Soldiers and Army Civilians returned to duty.  Develop theater personnel distribution plans and allocate theater NRP replacements. CORPS G-1/AG AND DIVISION G-1 3-66. Corps G-1/AGs and division G-1s monitor deployed personnel accounting systems to ensure compliance with ASCC guidance and timelines, and resolve corps and division personnel accountability issues. Since SRC 12 formations exist to improve unit personnel accountability, coordination with the TPOC and or supporting HROB is critical. The corps G-1/AG or division G-1 perform ASCC personnel strength reporting responsibilities when serving as the Army Force G-1/AG, and establish and enforce reporting requirements for subordinate units. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific PASR responsibilities of the corps G-1/AG and division G-1. HROC 3-67. The ASCC HROC supports the ASCC G-1/AG in accomplishing personnel accountability and strength reporting for the theater. The ASCC HROC provides additional personnel asset visibility and coordinates with the TPOC personnel accountability and systems division regarding the deployed database hierarchy management to the ASCC G-1/AG. Corps and division HROCs assists the corps G-1/AG and division G-1 sections in accomplishing personnel accountability and strength reporting for corps and division AORs. BRIGADE/STB S-1 (GENERAL OFFICER-LEVEL HQ) 3-68. Brigade/STB S-1 sections maintain accountability for assigned or attached personnel, to include replacements and RTD Soldiers, Army Civilians, CAAF including other theater designated contractor personnel, and multinational personnel, as required. They collect, summarize, analyze, update, and report personnel strength information to the G-1/AG or higher HQ, and monitor duty status change information (for example, present for duty, wounded-in-action, killed-in-action, and missing-in-action). 3-69. The brigade S-1 is typically the lowest level at which strength is coordinated and reported to HRC. Although the battalion S-1 internally tracks its units’ strength and provides this information to the brigade S-1, all coordination for replacements are executed at the brigade-level. Brigades typically coordinate independently of the division/corps/ASCC G-1/AG, although they often have oversight of their brigades’ progress. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific PASR responsibilities of the brigade/STB S-1 section. BATTALION S-1 3-70. Battalion S-1 sections maintain accountability for assigned or attached personnel, to include replacements and RTD Soldiers, Army Civilians, CAAF including other theater designated contractor personnel, and multinational personnel, as required. They collect, summarize, analyze, update, and report personnel strength information to the brigade S-1, and perform error reconciliation between the manual PERSTAT and DTAS daily. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific PASR responsibilities of the battalion S-1 section. TPOC, PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY AND SYSTEMS DIVISION 3-71. The personnel accountability and systems division coordinates with the local network enterprise center, establishes and manages the theater-wide personnel accountability database as directed, and maintains theater HR systems. The division is responsible for coordinating with the HROBs and TG PAT for the recommendation of the emplacement and displacement of HR squads performing a personnel accounting mission, providing technical guidance, and maintaining visibility of personnel transiting inter and intra-theater ports of debarkation. The division produces data, reports, and other information for the ASCC G-1/AG that is required for the analysis of strength reporting, casualty, postal, and personnel accounting operations. The personnel accountability and systems division ensures all systems remain active and properly synchronized to receive data from both the supporting personnel accountability elements and the G-1/AG and S-1 sections operating in the AO. The division coordinates with the HROBs to ensure systems are Chapter 3 3-18 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 established and resourced to effectively perform missions. Specific responsibilities of the division include, but are not limited to––  Execute personnel accountability IAW the policies and priorities established by the theater G-1/AG.  Utilize applicable HR systems to prepare, collect, and analyze required reports to maintain situational awareness of theater personnel accountability status and operations. Maintains the functionality of the theater database hierarchy and adjusts as the ASCC G-1/AG and G-3 updates and modifies task organization.  Provide assistance and support to the ASCC G-1/AG in developing and executing the R&R program.  Conduct staff assistance visits for HR squads performing personnel accounting missions.  Upload HR enabling systems software to manage personnel accounting information from HR elements and supported G-1/AGs and S-1s.  Perform DTAS data quality control checks.  Reconcile data between other HR systems.  Provide technical guidance and training support to HR elements (TG PAT, HROB, and HR squads performing personnel accounting missions) and supported units (G-1/AGs and S-1s) as necessary.  Ensure HR elements and supporting organizations have the appropriate access level for personnel accounting, to include NIPRNET and SIPRNET connectivity.  Advise the theater G-1/AG of any unit who has a strength imbalance between DTAS and the unit PERSTAT. (Note: The theater ASCC G-1/AG directs units to conduct personnel asset inventories).  Ensure all deviations from original assignments are coordinated with the HRC, TG PAT, and appropriate G-1/AGs and S-1s.  Ensure transit categories include replacement, R&R, RTD, leave, and unit movements to and from theater.  Assist the TSC DMC and the ASCC G-1/AG with planning and operational oversight of personnel accountability operations in the deployed AO.  Deploy adequate personnel as part of the early entry element to establish initial theater HR systems.  Participate and ensure all systems are included in the planning, deployment, sustainment, and redeployment process for current and future HR operations.  Continue to assess and analyze the effectiveness of HR systems throughout current operations.  Provide data support, information, and reports to the TSC and Army/ASCC G-1/AG as necessary. HROB 3-72. The HROB is an SRC 63 (Sustainment) organization element within the ESC DMC, DSB SPO, and sustainment brigade SPO section responsible for the planning, synchronization, coordination, and integration of personnel accountability support in their individual AOs. The HROB at the sustainment brigade plans what the HR companies and subordinate platoons executes. The HROB in the sustainment brigade with the theater opening mission provides technical guidance to the HR company and TG PAT at the theater gateway. The HROBs at other echelons provide technical guidance for other intra-theater accountability missions executed by SRC 12 formations. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific personnel accounting responsibilities of the HROB. TG PAT 3-73. The TG PAT is the HR organization responsible for coordinating and establishing personnel accountability at the RSOI point as units and personnel enter, transit, or depart theater of operations. The mission of the TG PAT is to conduct the personnel accounting portion of the RSOI process, load personnel data from DTAS, and conduct limited EPS for transient personnel. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific personnel accounting responsibilities of the TG PAT. Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-19 HR COMPANY/HR PLATOON 3-74. The HR company HQ provides command and control as well as administrative and operational support to the TG PAT and forward operating HR squads conducting personnel accountability missions. At the APOD, the operations section provides data integration support and the HR platoons manage the HR squads conducting personnel accountability missions. 3-75. The HR platoon is a multi-functional platoon with the capability to leverage HR squads to conduct personnel accounting or HR support to casualty operations missions, depending on mission requirements. This capability increases the mission flexibility and its ability to support the theater personnel accounting or casualty operations mission. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific personnel accounting responsibilities of the HR company and HR platoon. HR SQUAD (MULTI-FUNCTIONAL) 3-76. Human resources squads execute personnel accountability team missions. One HR squad has the capability to capture personnel accounting data up to 600 personnel entering, transiting, or departing the APOD or from an intra-theater APOD. Each HR platoon can process up to 1,800 personnel per day. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific personnel accounting responsibilities of the HR squad with a personnel accounting mission. BATTLEFIELD FLOW 3-77. The ASCC G-1/AG establishes theater policy for personnel strength reporting to include reporting standards and timelines. Coordination with the ASCC G-6 is necessary to ensure access to NIPRNET and SIPRNET is established for required HR databases and systems. During LSCO, strength managers must be prepared to operate with limited or no connectivity because the operational environment will likely result in disconnected, degraded, or disrupted communications access. The ASCC G-1/AG at echelons must establish alternate methods of passing critical information by developing and rehearsing alternate, contingency, and emergency plans to ensure continuity for personnel strength reporting.  The early entry element of the TPOC establishes the DTAS and initiates database hierarchy management.  The HR company, supported by a TG PAT and subordinate platoons, establishes theater personnel accounting operations at theater reception points (APOD/sea port of debarkation) as they transit the theater.  The HR company with the TG PAT ensures all personnel and units arriving in theater are accurately entered in DTAS. For unit arrivals, the S-1 normally provides a copy of their unit’s database, which the TG PAT then uploads into DTAS.  Units have primary responsibility for the strength reporting of their formation, but SRC 12 formations are located at critical points on the battlefield to improve personnel accountability. 3-78. The TG PAT enters all arriving personnel (Soldiers, DOD and DA Civilians, and CAAF) and units in the system to ensure accurate personnel strength reporting throughout the duration of theater-level operations. As units and individuals arrive in theater, the HR squad assigned the personnel accounting mission, which directly affects the effectiveness of deployed personnel strength reporting, records their arrival in theater. The S-1 sections perform all personnel accounting tasks within their elements for small-scale movements conducted within the brigade AO and in movement to the intra-theater APOD where no HR organization assets are assigned. Units are ultimately responsible for the reported status of their entire formation. SECTION III – HR SUPPORT TO REPLACEMENT OPERATIONS 3-79. This section describes HR support to replacement operations’ mission, proponency, flow of replacements, and standards and principles of support. It also describes how the Army intends to establish and operate a theater Army non-unit related personnel (individual) replacement system. Chapter 3 3-20 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 OVERVIEW OF HR SUPPORT TO REPLACEMENT OPERATIONS 3-80. The mission of the replacement system is to move personnel from designated points of origin to ultimate destinations while ensuring they are equipped and trained. The goal of the individual replacement process is to fill units with trained Soldiers to maintain operational readiness and sustain combat power for the commander. The process includes the physical reception, accounting, processing, support, reequipping, training, and delivery of military and civilian personnel. This includes both replacement and RTD Soldiers. It does not include the decision-making process associated with determining allocation of replacements, which is described under PRM. 3-81. Due to the relatively low levels of casualties the Army has experienced during recent conflicts, the personnel demands on the replacement system have been limited. Although HR formations and G-1/AGs and S-1s at echelon still have a role in replacement operations, they do not have the holistic responsibility they did when HR replacement formations existed. The sustainment community has shared ownership over the execution of replacement operations and is in the process of codifying roles and responsibilities by echelon and organization. Human resources support to replacement operations includes the following:  Personnel accounting and strength reporting as part of the reception process at echelon.  Providing EPS to NRP (individual replacements).  Informing the sustainment enterprise of allocation decisions so movement of personnel (NRP, RTD personnel, and DOD and DA Civilians (excluding contractors)) within the theater can be coordinated/synchronized. 3-82. Headquarters, Department of the Army, DCS G-1, Directorate of Military Personnel Management, establishes individual replacement policy; the HRC implements the policy. That policy guides the development of individual replacement plans for each established theater of operations, based on casualty estimates and replacement requirements developed and approved by combatant commanders. Casualty and replacement estimates are determined through MPTk. The replacement requirements go back to the Army G-3 to determine sourcing: Individual Replacement System, Small Team Replacement System, Unit Replacement System (company/troop/battery) or larger, or a hybrid approach. 3-83. The HQDA, DCS G-3/5/7, in coordination with FORSCOM, sources unit replacements and informs the HRC how many of the remaining replacement processes for managing and filling the Army’s manning requirements are expected to be filled by an Individual or Small Team Replacement System during war, crisis, and national emergency. The HRC sources individual replacements as determined by the HQDA approved replacement policy from Army G-1, Directorate of Military Personnel Management and HQDA DCS G-3/5/7 prioritization. Refer to AR 600-8-111, Army Mobilization, Manning, and Wartime Replacement Operations, for policies. When required, individual replacements move from their home station to the CRC for training for those requirements sourced by individual replacements. Figure 3-3 depicts a notional NRP replacement operations framework. Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-21 Figure 3-3. Notional non-unit related personnel replacement operations framework 3-84. The FORSCOM G-3 must identify a unit to manage the CRC. Soldiers receive equipment and final medical screening before departure for theater. This is a consolidated effort with the operations, medical, logistics, and HR communities. Once Soldiers are cleared for movement to theater, the CRC contacts the ASCC G-3 to notify them of the availability of individual replacements. The HRC places Soldiers on assignment instructions for individual replacement requirements and IMCOM publishes the orders using Format 401 per AR 600-8-105, Military Orders, paragraph 4-4 and DA PAM 600-8-105, Military Orders, figure 4-1. The HRC provides replacements to units based on the distribution management sub-level account utilizing current Army manning guidance if the installation is not over strength when available personnel and prioritization permits. 3-85. To provide individuals as personnel replacements, active Army NRP (individual replacements) arrive at the installation and are in-processed by the installation and unit. These individual replacements would be moved forward as theater requirements demand. Reserve component individual replacement personnel process through the CRC. Diversions from the original assignment should be by exception and only made to meet operational requirements. To enable speed of replacements during LSCO, individual replacement personnel may not be sent to an installation, but perhaps to a regeneration task force and distributed IAW ASCC manning priorities. 3-86. Individual replacements, small groups or teams of Soldiers will also arrive from various locations to the theater of operations to fill identified replacement requirements. These requirements may exist due to units that cannot deploy at 100 percent strength or the projected replacement requirement based on casualty estimates. REPLACEMENT FLOW BY ECHELON FOR NON-UNIT RELATED PERSONNEL 3-87. The following paragraphs discuss replacement flow by echelon for NRP. Figure 3-4 on page 3-22 describes a way for the sustainment enterprise, at echelon, to integrate capabilities, similar to that of the former HR replacement battalions and replacement companies, into existing formations to facilitate the Chapter 3 3-22 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 sustainment of NRP replacements within the scope and scale expected of LSCO. For example, the ASCC will assign responsibilities for NRP replacement operations to the TSC. Specific tasks to support NRP replacement operations are assigned to the subordinate units of the TSC from an ESC, sustainment brigade, combat sustainment support battalion, down to a movement control team. Those tasks include feeding, billeting, limited supply, finance, personnel accountability, health service support, battlefield orientation, and transportation of replacements to their assigned units. Due to limited organic support force structure, NRP replacement operations may require extensive commercial support. The TSC SPO will need to identify gaps and develop requirements packages to ensure the availability of commercial support when needed. Figure 3-4. Notional non-unit related personnel replacements functions crosswalk ASCC G-1/AG 3-88. The ASCC G-1/AG works in-conjunction with the unit tasked with ADCON of individual replacements at the theater-level (such as a regional support group in the absence of a sustainment brigade HROB) to ensure proper accountability and monitor the length of time Soldiers stay at theater-level before moving to the next destination. Prior to a unit arriving in theater, the ASCC G-1/AG strength team requests a DUIC through the G-3 force management channels for use by the HRC when assigning individual replacements to the theater of operations. The use of the DUIC facilitates PASR at theater-level. The ASCC G-1/AG strength team also conducts PRM and PIM for the theater to provide the ASCC commander an updated combat power snapshot. The DUIC enables the ASCC G-1/AG strength team to view available replacements. The ASCC G-1/AG, in coordination with the G-3, reviews replacement priority and provides the unit exercising ADCON over individual replacements the priority of movement and final unit of assignment. The ASCC G-1/AG strength team will provide initial or diversion orders to replacements as required. 3-89. The ASCC is responsible for developing push packages with an estimated number of replacements required by day over the length of the OPLAN/concept plan. Replacement requirements are derived from the MPTk and are approved by the combatant commander. The ASCC is responsible for PASR as part of the reception process (executed by the TSC TPOC and SRC 12 formations assigned the theater gateway mission). Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-23 CORPS AND FIELD ARMY G-1/AG 3-90. The corps and/or field army G-1/AG works in-conjunction with the unit tasked with ADCON of individual replacements (such as a regional support group) to ensure proper accountability and monitor the length of time Soldiers stay at the corps support area before moving to the next destination. Once the ASCC G-1/AG provides updated gains rosters, the corps and/or field army G-1/AG uses the current priority of fill to determine assignments and publishes orders. The corps and/or field army G-3 ensures theater training is complete. The corps and/or field army G-4 ensures all equipment requirements are met. Billeting, feeding, and medical support are coordinated by the formation that has ADCON over the replacement personnel. The corps/field army G-1/AG works with the supporting HROB to ensure that movement requirements are incorporated into the resourcing process for transportation of Soldiers to their units. The corps and/or field army G-1/AG, and HR elements, are not responsible for housing, feeding, training, equipping, or transporting replacements. However, they are responsible for PASR as part of the reception process and for tracking Soldiers to their destinations. The corps and/or field army G-1/AG provides limited EPS to transient personnel, and provides the priority of movement and allocation decision to the unit exercising ADCON over individual replacements.The key element is the linkage between the corps and/or field army G-1/AG and the ESC HROB to ensure movement requirements for replacements and RTD personnel are incorporated into the transportation allocation process DIVISION G-1 3-91. The division G-1 works in-conjunction with the unit tasked with ADCON of individual replacements to ensure proper accountability and the length of time Soldiers stay at the division support area before moving to the next destination. The division G-1strength team conducts PRM, PASR, and PIM for their units to provide the division commander an updated combat power snapshot. Once the corps and/or field army G-1/AG provides a current gains rosters, the division G-1 uses the current priority of fill to determine assignments and publishes orders as required. The division G-1 works with the division G-3 to update the priority of fill based on changes to the mission. The division G-4 works on class VII requirements to determine if equipment is available for replacements. Billeting, feeding, and medical support are coordinated by the formation that has ADCON over the individual replacement personnel. The division G-1 works with the supporting HROB to ensure transportation requirements for replacements and RTD personnel are incorporated into the DSB transportation allocation process for transportation of Soldiers to their units. The division G-1, and/or HR elements, are not responsible for housing, feeding, training, equipping, or transporting replacements. However, the division G-1 is responsible for PASR as part of the reception process and for tracking Soldiers to their destinations. The division G-1 provides limited EPS to transient personnel, and provides the priority of movement and allocation decision to the unit exercising ADCON over individual replacements. The key element is the linkage between the division G-1 and the sustainment brigade HROB to ensure movement requirements for replacements and RTD personnel are incorporated into the transportation allocation process. BRIGADE S-1 3-92. The brigade S-1 works in-conjunction with the headquarters and headquarters company commander to ensure proper accountability and the length of time Soldiers stay at the brigade support area before moving to the next destination. The brigade S-1 strength team conducts PRM, PASR, and PIM for their units to provide the brigade commander an updated combat power snapshot. Once the division G-1 provides a current gains rosters, the brigade S-1 uses the current priority of fill to determine assignments and publishes orders as required. The brigade S-1 works with the brigade S-3 to update the priority of fill based on changes to the mission. The brigade S-4 works on class VII requirements to determine if equipment is available for replacements. The brigade S-1 works with the brigade S-4 and brigade support battalion for transportation of Soldiers to their units. The brigade S-1 is not responsible for housing, feeding, training, equipping, providing medical support, or transporting replacements. However, the brigade S-1 is responsible for PASR as part of the reception process, for tracking Soldiers to their destinations, providing EPS to transient personnel, and providing the priority of movement and allocation decision to the headquarters and headquarters company. Chapter 3 3-24 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 BATTALION S-1 3-93. Battalion S-1 HR support to replacement operations responsibilities include the following critical tasks:  Coordinate battalion orientation requirements.  Account for arriving personnel and tracking them to their destinations (PASR).  Provide EPS to transient personnel.  Coordinating/synchronizing the movement of personnel (NRP replacements, RTD personnel, and DOD and DA Civilians (excluding contractors)) within the theater based on the allocation decision made in the PRM process. World War II Personnel Replacements During World War II, the U.S. Army sustained about 936,259 battle casualties. Non-battle admissions to sick reports numbered about 17,000,000. In overseas theaters about 79 percent of the admissions to sick reports were for disease, 13 percent for injury, and 5 percent for combat wounds. Plans were made for heavy combat losses, but the extent of non-combat losses was greater than had been expected. There was no precedent to indicate the number of personnel required to fill a global pipeline such as was necessary in World War II. In commenting on this phase of the war planning, General Marshall, on 23 June 1945, told the House Appropriations Committee: “In the first half of the war in connection with the campaigns in Africa, New Guinea, and the major portion of the campaign in Italy, I would say the War Department miscalculated, if you choose to call it that, in not fully appreciating what it required to fill the pipeline of global warfare to keep things moving at a fast pace; which means to get the total number of men you want at the right place at the right time and in the right position. In the original calculations on the strength of the Army, we did not take into sufficient account how much time and men were involved in going and coming, in sickness, on furlough, and so forth. Our calculations were also off in that we did not take into sufficient account the large numbers of men required to form pools behind the Army, ready to take the place of casualties the following day if possible.” SECTION IV – HR SUPPORT TO CASUALTY OPERATIONS 3-94. Human resources support to casualty operations includes collecting, recording, reporting, verifying, and the processing of casualty information from unit-level to HQDA (CMAOD) normally within 12 hours of incident. The recorded information facilitates NOK notification, casualty assistance, casualty tracking and status updates, and provides the basis for historical and statistical reports. Holistic casualty operations involve a wider array of missions and organizations to oversee things like LOD determinations, disposition of remains and personal effects (a responsibility of the mortuary affairs organization of the supporting sustainment command), military funeral honors, and casualty mail coordination. Personnel, medical, logistic, and provost marshal communities all have a piece of casualty operations. Accurate and timely casualty reporting is paramount; however, operational constraints may preclude units from meeting reporting requirements. The casualty system must continually reconcile duty status-whereabouts unknown, missing-in-action, and medical evacuation cases against other sources of information such as significant activity reports to reach a final casualty status determination. Casualty information flows up, across, and down the reporting chain to help account for Soldiers and reportable DOD and DA Civilians. 3-95. A clear, collaborative system for casualty operations information is critical for effective management. When developing theater casualty operations policies and procedures, casualty managers must not only consider doctrinal guidance, but also decisions and agreements made by the JTF/combatant commander Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-25 allowing subordinate commanders (corps-level) to approve and release casualty reports directly to the CMAOD. 3-96. Units are ultimately responsible for casualty reporting for their Soldiers. Standard requirements code 12 formations exist to assist the units by providing critical casualty information at key nodes on the battlefield to improve the timeliness and accuracy of casualty reports. The speed at which casualty information changes make this mission set extremely challenging. The medical evacuation system may move injured Soldiers from the battlefield to corps hospitals while the unit is still engaged and before an initial report is even submitted by the unit. Therefore, it is critical for communications to be established to furnish timely casualty information from HR squads located at key nodes. Additionally, due to the sensitive nature of the information, casualty operations sections must include very clear verbiage regarding the mandate to safeguard casualty information to prevent premature and/or erroneous disclosure and to protect patient privacy. Commanders are responsible for ensuring that casualty information is protected and only processed through official channels. Note: Until an automated interface is created between the personnel, mortuary affairs, and medical systems, HR squads will continue to be co-located with mortuary affairs companies and Role 3 MTFs to include other Service and host-nation hospitals to provide the interface between the systems. 3-97. Installation casualty assistance centers are engaged in the notification and assistance aspect of casualty operations as prescribed in AR 638-8, Army Casualty Program, and DA PAM 638-8, Procedures for the Army Casualty Program. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 and ATP 1-0.2 for detailed information pertaining to HR support to casualty operations. ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES 3-98. Commanders must ensure procedures are followed IAW AR 638-8, as well as timelines established for AR 15-6 and LOD investigations and presentation to the primary NOK. Commanders will inform CMAOD when AR 15-6 and LOD investigations are initiated as well as point of contact information for which unit staff will provide updates at 30-day intervals until the investigations are completed. 3-99. Multiple agencies, units, and echelons of command have critical roles in establishing and operating the Defense Casualty Information Processing System-Personnel Casualty Reporting (DCIPS-PCR), the single authorized system for casualty reporting in DOD. Levels of commands and their supporting agencies’ responsibilities for casualty functions and tasks are depicted in table 3-1 on pages 3-25 and 3-26 and are described in the following paragraphs.

The casualty and mortuary affairs operations division, HRC, is the lead agency for the Army Casualty Program and has technical supervision and oversight of theater CICs and installation casualty assistance centers worldwide. The CMAOD mission is to develop and execute Army casualty and mortuary affairs to support DOD-directed missions and the Total Army Family for present and past conflicts, and serves as the Army point of contact for those Soldiers and DOD and DA Civilians in a captured or missing status. The CMAOD serves as the lead agent for the DCIPS. See AR 638-8 for more information on the Army Casualty Program. THEATER (ASCC) G-1/AG 3-101. The Army/ASCC G-1/AG develops casualty OPLANs and policies for theater, provides oversight for theater casualty reporting, and is responsible for establishing the theater CIC as part of theater opening Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-27 operations with the ASCC HROC. The Army/ASCC G-1/AG establishes casualty reporting authorities for submission of casualty reports (based on guidance and agreements from the JTF, joint forces land component command, and coalition forces land component command). The Army/ASCC G-1/AG establishes policy for location of positioning of HR squads performing casualty liaison missions. ASCC HROC (THEATER CASUALTY INFORMATION CENTER) 3-102. The ASCC HROC establishes the theater CIC and manages casualty reporting within the theater of operations IAW policies established by the ASCC G-1/AG. Specific responsibilities of the theater CIC include, but are not limited to––  Execute casualty OPLANs and policies developed by the Army ASCC G-1/AG.  Serve as the point of contact for all CMAOD actions by establishing a direct link to CMAOD.  Serve as the repository for casualty reports, track locations of the AOR medical facilities, and perform all necessary communication and coordination with hospitals, mortuary affairs company HQ, supported units and subordinate HQ to perform casualty reporting operations in coordination with the ASCC G-1/AG.  Report all casualties from DOD and DA Civilians, CAAF, multinational forces, and personnel from other Services (if the sponsoring Service is not in the immediate area).  Receive, process, and forward all casualty reports in theater.  Maintain and provide casualty data and briefings for the ASCC G-1/AG.  Assist CMAOD through monitoring formal LOD investigations on deceased Soldiers.  Collect casualty reports from brigade S-1s and HR squads performing casualty reporting missions and submit to CMAOD.  Ensure initial casualty reports flow through the theater CIC to CMAOD as quickly as possible from time of incident.  Establish the theater Army casualty records center.  Coordinate with the HROB to ensure the HR squads performing casualty reporting missions are established within the HR company.  Assist with validating casualty mail information.  Maintain casualty information of all theater personnel.  Submit initial, supplemental, and status change casualty reports.  Synchronize casualty operations between the Army/ASCC G-1/AG, subordinate G-1/AGs, S-1s, and mortuary affairs activities 3-103. The theater CIC is the focal point for casualty report processing. It serves as the casualty records repository for all records (digital and paper) within theater. The web-based casualty reporting application to the DCIPS system further enables file recall for installation casualty assistance centers, G-1/AGs, and S-1s, as all reports applying to a social security number can be recalled. CORPS G-1/AG AND DIVISION G-1 3-104. Corps G-1/AGs and division G-1s administer authority levels for submission of casualty reports for assigned and attached units. They are responsible for submitting initial casualty reports using DCIPS-PCR to the theater CIC within prescribed timelines. If the corps is granted authority by the JTF commander, joint force land component commander, or coalition forces land component commander, reports may be submitted directly to CMAOD with a copy provided to the theater CIC. Additionally, the corps G-1/AG and division G-1 has additional HR support to casualty operations responsibilities if serving as the Army Forces G-1/AG. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific HR support to casualty operations responsibilities of the corps G-1/AG and division G-1. BRIGADE S-1/STB S-1 (GENERAL OFFICER-LEVEL HQ) 3-105.The brigade S-1 has responsibility for maintaining casualty reports and the status of all assigned and attached personnel at MTFs with assistance from HR squads at critical nodes. The brigade S-1 is the point of Chapter 3 3-28 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 entry for casualty data into DCIPS-PCR and is required to submit supplemental, status change, and progress reports as applicable. Brigades are responsible for coordinating with the Fatal Accident section of CMAOD whenever there is a military-related accidental death or any death within the unit covered under AR 638-34. Refer to ATP 1-0.1, appendix D, S-1 Assessment, and use the list to assess the effectiveness of brigade HR support to casualty operations. In addition, refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific HR support to casualty operations responsibilities of the brigade S-1/STB S-1. BATTALION S-1 3-106. The battalion S-1 has responsibility for preparing casualty reports and maintaining the status of assigned and attached personnel at MTFs with assistance from the HR squads. Battalion S-1s forward all original casualty forms to the brigade. The battalion ensures all Soldiers and DOD and DA Civilians carry and are trained on the use of the DA Form 1156 (Casualty Feeder Card) to ensure effective reporting when casualties occur. The battalion processes casualty reports using DA Form 1156 as a template to capture the information needed to complete a casualty report and ensures the form is filled out and submitted to the brigade S-1 or into DCIPS without delay, or as soon as the tactical situation permits. Currently, field grade officers must approve casualty reports for accuracy and completeness before submission, but losses at the scale of LSCO against a peer threat may require an exception to this policy to ensure timely reporting. Battalion S-1s should also coordinate any information they receive on mortuary affairs or personal effects disposition with the battalion S-4. Refer to ATP 1-0.1, Appendix D, S-1 Assessment, and use the list to assess the effectiveness of battalion HR support to casualty operations. In addition, refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific HR support to casualty operations responsibilities of the battalion S-1. TPOC, POSTAL OPERATIONS DIVISION 3-107. The TPOC POD provides oversight of all postal casualty mail processing and associated timeliness, and develops SOPs for casualty mail procedures. Refer to chapter 4 of this publication for specific responsibilities of the TPOC POD. HROB 3-108. The HROB monitors casualty operations within their AO to determine placement of HR squads performing a casualty liaison mission. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific HR support to casualty operations responsibilities of the HROB. HR COMPANY HEADQUARTERS 3-109. The HR company HQ provides command and control, planning, and technical support to all assigned or attached HR squads and delivers HR area support for casualty operations in the deployed AO. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific HR support to casualty operations responsibilities of the HR company HQ. HR PLATOON 3-110. The HR platoon receives all administrative guidance through the HR company HQ and functions as part of the theater casualty reporting system by placing HR squads for casualty reporting missions at General Officer headquarters, theater CIC, mortuary affairs companies, and Role 3 MTFs in their AO. The HR platoon provides leadership, training assistance, and administrative support to the HR squads performing a casualty reporting mission. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific HR support to casualty operations responsibilities of the HR platoon. HR SQUAD (MULTI-FUNCTIONAL) 3-111. Human resources squads performing a casualty reporting mission provide accurate and timely casualty reporting and tracking information at Role 3 MTFs, theater mortuary affairs company HQ, General Officer commands, and the theater CIC to supplement casualty reporting information from G-1/AGs and S-1s at echelon. They must deploy as members of all early entry elements to facilitate the casualty reporting flow. The HR squads performing a casualty reporting mission facilitate real-time casualty information for Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-29 commanders. They provide updated status reports to affected units and inform them when Soldiers leave theater to supplement the information for the unit and the NOK. They also assist with coordinating a Soldier’s RTD. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for further information pertaining to the casualty liaison elements. Under the scope and scale of LSCO, HR squads may also be allocated as required to brigade-level formations to assist with casualty reporting and personnel accountability missions at that formation. INSTALLATION CASUALTY ASSISTANCE CENTER 3-112. Installation casualty assistance centers are primarily involved with the casualty notification and assistance to the NOK. They operate based upon a geographic AOR and may, depending on the situation, extend beyond their AOR. Installation casualty assistance centers operate in peacetime and during operations. Their responsibilities include, but are not limited to––  Assist families with survivor’s benefits and entitlements.  Coordinate escorts for remains.  Make funeral arrangements to include family funeral travel.  Provide military burial honors and personal effects disposition (the rear detachment summary court martial officer handles personal effects at home station). Note: Some forward-stationed casualty assistance centers (theater casualty assistance centers) perform the same functions as an installation casualty assistance center. They should not be confused with theater casualty information centers that have different responsibilities for the ASCC in wartime and are staffed by the ASCC HROC. QUARTERMASTER MORTUARY AFFAIRS COMPANY 3-113. The mortuary affairs company’s role is to provide mortuary affairs operations across the range of military operations. The company performs the following tasks: mortuary affairs collection point operations, mortuary affairs contaminated remains mitigation site operations, theater mortuary evacuation point operations, and personal effects depot. The company performs these tasks by assigning platoons to the specific task or mission; however, these platoons do not perform these tasks concurrently. 3-114. The mortuary affairs company is generally attached to a division sustainment support battalion or combat sustainment support battalion. One mortuary affairs company is allocated per corps. Mortuary affairs teams can be further attached to brigade support battalions for allocation to brigade combat teams across a division. The company is designed to process up to 400 human remains per day from up to 20 mortuary affairs collection point locations. The mortuary affairs company may establish a main collection point at corps or division support areas when required, evacuates human remains to the theater mortuary evacuation point, and operates the theater mortuary evacuation point with the ability to process up to 250 human remains daily. Refer to ATP 4-46, Contingency Fatality Operations, for detailed information regarding the responsibilities of the Quartermaster mortuary affairs company. BATTLEFIELD FLOW 3-115. Casualty information is collected and reported through official channels as quickly as possible with the standard being that it is passed to the CMAOD normally within hours of knowledge of incident. A casualty is any person who is lost to the organization by having been declared deceased, duty status-whereabouts unknown, excused absence-whereabouts unknown, missing, injured, or ill. Units will report all casualties to include American civilians, DOD and DA Civilians, CAAF, and personnel of other Services. Due to the personal nature of information within casualty reports, the theater CIC reports casualty information to the CMAOD using DCIPS as the official means of casualty reporting. In the absence of the ASCC HROC, the senior element G-1/AG must immediately assume the role of the theater CIC. The scope and scale of personnel losses expected during LSCO against a peer competitor has the potential to overwhelm the casualty reporting process timelines and negatively impact the notification process. Commanders should consider supplementing the casualty reporting system at critical nodes with HR squads or ad hoc teams with sufficient capability to gather and report casualty information in a timely manner. Chapter 3 3-30 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 3-116. All persons with knowledge of a casualty will report to their chain of command using the DA Form 1156. The commander of the unit in which a casualty occurs has the responsibility for initiating the casualty report. The DA Form 1156 is used to submit an initial report when a casualty incident is observed. It is used to document critical information, which is forwarded to the battalion S-1 section for submission to the brigade S-1 section. Casualty information is frequently incomplete on the battlefield. This should not delay the initial report submission. Updated casualty information is provided as it becomes available. The brigade S-1 section submits the initial casualty report using DCIPS to ensure all echelons have visibility. Based on guidance from the combatant commander, the ASCC G-1/AG may delegate authority for corps-level commanders to release casualty reports directly to CMAOD with a copy provided to the theater CIC. Casualty reports must be verified against available information systems. 3-117. Human resources squads performing casualty reporting missions work with the ASCC HROC operating the theater CIC. The G-1/AG and S-1 at echelon have overall responsibility for casualty reporting on behalf of their formations; SRC 12 HR squads supplement their efforts with information from Role 3 MTF and mortuary affairs company HQ and additional capacity at General Officer HQ and potentially within brigades. Soldiers may immediately medically evacuate to an MTF where the HR squad (casualty liaison element) interact face-to-face and generate a DCIPS report for submission, in coordination with the Soldiers’ unit, to the theater CIC. 3-118. For injured and ill Soldiers, CMAOD contacts the supporting installation casualty assistance center who in turn contacts the Soldier’s rear detachment. The rear detachment makes telephonic notification for injured and ill Soldiers and then reports back to the installation casualty assistance center when notification is complete. Once notification is complete, CMAOD contacts the NOK and prepares Invitational Travel Orders to travel to the Soldier’s bedside if the Soldier’s doctor requests their presence. The CMAOD contacts the supporting CONUS and/or overseas CONUS installation casualty assistance center to coordinate for notification of NOK (as per the DD Form 93) for deceased Soldiers. Figure 3-5 depicts an illustration of the casualty reporting and tracking flow. Figure 3-5. Casualty reporting and tracking flow Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-31 Casualty Reporting and Notification Lieutenant Colonel Harold G. “Hal” Moore commanded the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry in November 1965, when an air assault into the Ia Drang valley of South Vietnam triggered the first major battle between U.S. Army combat units and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) regular regiments. After three days of bloody battle, the NVA units withdrew, leaving the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry in possession of the battlefield around Landing Zone (LZ) X-Ray. Moore’s unit suffered 79 Americans killed in action (KIAs), and 121 wounded in action (WIAs). In the following quote, Moore relates how the Army of 1965 had forgotten the lessons of World War II in how to perform casualty notifications after a large battle: “But on November 18, 1965, in the sleepy Southern town of Columbus, Georgia the first of the telegrams were already arriving from Washington. The war was so new and the casualties so few that the Army had not even considered establishing the casualty notification teams. [Instead] Western Union simply handed the telegrams over to Yellow Cab drivers to deliver. The driver who brought the [notification of Sergeant Billy R. Elliot was blind drunk and staggering. As Mrs. Elliot stood in the doorway clutching the yellow paper, the [driver] fell backwards off her porch and passed out in her flower bed, In Columbus that terrible autumn, someone had to do the right thing since the Army wasn’t organized to do it. For the families of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, that someone was my wife. As the taxicabs and telegrams spread misery and grief, Julie [Moore] followed them doing her best to comfort those whose lives had been destroyed. Mrs. Harry Kinnard, wife of the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division went public with criticism of the heartless telegrams, and the Army swiftly organized proper casualty notification teams consisting of a chaplain and an accompanying officer. Nobody intended for this cruelty to happen. Everyone, including the Army, was taken totally by surprise by the magnitude of the casualties at LZ X-Ray and Albany.” SECTION V – PERSONNEL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT 3-119. Personnel information management is a process to accurately collect, protect, process, store, display, reconcile, validate, maintain, and disseminate information about Soldiers, their family members, DOD and DA Civilians, military retirees, and other personnel as required. Personnel information management supports the execution of all HR core competencies and subordinate key functions. The information can be in the form of data, pictures of data, or documents. Data from documents are entered in the Army database and shared with the DOD IAW DODI 8320.02, Sharing Data, Information, and Technology (IT) Services in the Department of Defense. The Army Military Human Resource Record (AMHRR) is an administrative record as well as the official permanent record of military Service belonging to a Soldier. Properly managed, PIM satisfies the Army’s legal obligation to retain historical information about veterans, retirees, and DOD and DA Civilians who deploy with the force. The creation of a Soldier’s AMHRR begins with the first commitment by the government to the individual and commitment by the individual to the government (point of contract) during the acquire process and updated during the complete HR lifecycle IAW AR 600-8-104, Army Military Human Resource Records Management. 3-120. Every decision or action taken by the Army is based on information. Information management is included as part of all military operations and the operations process (planning, preparation, execution, and continuous assessment). Personnel information management supports the life cycle management of Soldiers (access/retain, assign, sustain, evaluate/promote, and separate). 3-121. The goal of PIM is to provide timely and accurate personnel data used to––  Provide accurate personnel information to support the execution of functions and actions.  Provide relevant and accurate personnel information to assist commanders in their decision-making process for HR functions and actions. Chapter 3 3-32 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Provide personnel information for developing essential elements of friendly information.  Provide personnel information data required in the execution of the sustainment warfighting function. ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES 3-122. Several agencies have critical responsibilities in managing the personnel information flow and maintenance. The personnel information network includes all units and Soldiers in the force. They usually fall into two categories: managers and users. 3-123. The management group consists of reporting units and database managers. Battalions and separate units are responsible for providing personnel information to support all HR core competencies and subordinate key functions. They record gains, losses, and other strength-related transactions in their electronic systems to inform higher echelons. 3-124. The user group includes personnel readiness, casualty, and postal personnel. Personnel readiness managers use the data to assess unit readiness and support allocation decisions. Casualty personnel use it for basic personnel information and casualty reporting verification. Postal leaders use it for the postal locator information and to manage the casualty mail system. The paragraphs below explain the roles and responsibilities of the various individuals and units in the PIM process. SOLDIERS AND DOD/DA CIVILIANS 3-125. Soldiers and DOD and DA Civilians have a responsibility to enter PIM self-service items and other essential personnel data promptly into the appropriate database when changes occur.COMMANDERS 3-126. Commanders at all levels are responsible for taking pro-active actions to protect and defend PIM data and documents, and ensuring actions requiring their attention or processing are conducted in a timely and accurate manner. Commanders are responsible for including inspection and oversight strategies to ensure any of their decisions or their staff’s actions result in timely submission in the respective PIM system. Special commander emphasis is given to disciplinary actions, readiness status, and commitment to the government or change in commitment to the government by the individual or vice versa. Commanders must ensure protection of documents and data pertaining to enlistment, appointment, duty stations, assignments, training, qualifications, performance, awards, medals, disciplinary actions, insurance, emergency data, separation, retirement, casualty, administrative remarks and any other personnel actions covered in AR 600-8-104. ASCC G-1/AG 3-127. The ASCC G-1/AG is responsible for all PIM policies in their operational area. Specific PIM responsibilities include—  Manage PASR using the appropriate HR system of record.  Establish and manage policies and procedures that affect PIM for subordinate units and the theater.  Publish implementing instructions for personnel policies and programs for supported units.  Establish, operate, and maintain ASCC deployed theater personnel database (through the TPOC and TG PAT). CORPS G-1/AG AND DIVISION G-1 3-128. The corps G-1/AG and division G-1 indirectly manages and monitors PIM for all assigned units. Corps G-1/AGs and division G-1s exercise these responsibilities primarily in their role of coordinating EPS and managing the casualty reporting system for the corps and division. Personnel information managers at corps and division should anticipate the inclusion of joint and multinational personnel as an implied PIM mission during LSCO. During stability and defense support of civil authorities, as security partnerships form and transfer of security responsibilities occur, G-1/AGs may assist host-nation security forces with the Man the Force 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 3-33 development of their own PIM system. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific PIM responsibilities of the corps G-1/AG and division G-1. BRIGADE S-1/STB S-1 (GENERAL OFFICER-LEVEL HQ) 3-129. The brigade/STB personnel readiness team is normally responsible for PIM. Personnel information managers at brigade should anticipate an implied PIM mission during LSCO, to include joint and multinational personnel. During stability and defense support of civil authorities, as security partnerships form and transfer of security responsibilities occur, brigade S-1s may assist host-nation security forces with the development of their own PIM system. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific PIM responsibilities of the brigade S-1/STB S-1. BATTALION S-1 3-130. The battalion S-1 is the primary entity responsible for data input and updates, and is the starting point for personnel information management. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific PIM responsibilities of the battalion S-1. TPOC 3-131. The TPOC personnel accountability and systems division manages theater-wide PIM. It maintains and operates the PIM database for the theater. Specific responsibilities include—  Manage personnel information (manual and/or electronic) on assigned and attached personnel updating HR systems.  Manage user access, roles, and responsibilities within DTAS.  Reconcile differences between DTAS and other HR systems and databases as required.  Maintains unit hierarchy in DTAS for all theater units (with assistance from the ASCC HROC).  Manage theater personnel accounting.  Manage personnel files and records IAW governing regulations and policies.  Provide technical guidance for PIM to HROBs, G-1/AGs, and brigade/STB S-1s.  Publish implementing instructions for personnel policies and program for support units and the theater.  Provide technical assistance to supported units on all HR automation systems in theater. HR SYSTEMS SUPPORT 3-132. Human resources systems are essential in accomplishing Army-wide PIM execution during LSCO. Human resources professionals rely heavily on HR systems and databases to provide commanders accurate reports and information for mission accomplishment. The inability to collect, process, and disseminate relevant HR information about units and personnel in a timely manner can seriously impede operations or the unit’s mission. Human resources operations must be prepared to sustain the ability to support forces in degraded operations. During degraded operations, HR professionals must establish measures to ensure information continues to flow, which may include manually completing forms and using radios to submit casualty reports, PERSTATs, or any other information relevant to commanders to maintain the sustainment COP. 3-133. Human resources professionals who are competent with HR systems and databases, and understand how HR functions and tasks are processed and conducted, is critical. It is also imperative to ensure HR professionals are cross-trained across all HR systems. Immediate NIPRNET and SIPRNET connectivity should be near the top of a unit’s priority list when arriving in theater for HR professionals to conduct required HR functions and tasks. For specific HR databases, systems, and other automation support/equipment needed to perform HR missions, refer to appendix A of this publication. This page intentionally left blank. 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-1 Chapter 4 Provide Human Resources Services Human resources services are functions directly affecting a Soldier’s status, assignment, qualifications, financial status, career progression, morale and cohesion, and quality of life, in addition to providing recreational, social, other support services for Soldiers, DOD and DA Civilians, and other personnel who deploy with the force. This chapter covers the HR services subordinate key functions of EPS, postal operations, Army Band operations, and morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) operations. SECTION I – ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL SERVICES 4-1. Essential personnel services functions are initiated by the Soldier, unit commanders, unit leaders, G-1/AGs and S-1s, or from the top of the HR system (HRC-level). Table 4-1, on pages 4-1 and 4-2, depicts the responsibilities for EPS functions. During LSCO, many EPS actions may be delayed due to wartime priorities. Most EPS actions are processed via the HR system of record, with documentation added to the AMHRR. However, there are some actions processed separately by the commander or S-1 (for example, congressional inquiries, customer service, and participation in boards). Typical actions initiated by Soldiers are requests for personnel actions using DA Form 4187 (Personnel Action), requests for leave or pass, updates to family member information for record of emergency data or life insurance elections, and updates to allotments, savings bonds, and/or direct deposit. Typical actions initiated by commanders include request for awards or decorations, promotions, reductions, bars to continued service, and completing DA Form 7652 (Disability Evaluation System [DES] Commander’s Performance and Functional Statement) on each Soldier referred to the Disability Evaluation System. Evaluation reports are normally initiated by the supervisor at all levels. Table 4-1.

Home station units will have visibility of Soldiers across installations and will be able to generate reports and perform transactions associated with promotions. Additionally, the IPPS-A will allow an HR professional in the member’s S-1 pool or a unit commander to initiate a suspension of favorable personnel action for Soldiers not co-located with their home station unit. 4-2. To provide effective and prompt HR services, it is critical that actions affecting Soldiers be processed or routed promptly by the chain of command and HR professionals. All EPS actions are processed, verified, or routed by HR professionals at each level of command (battalion, brigade, division, corps, and ASCC), less those items updated through Soldier self-service capabilities. While brigade-centric operations are the norm for HR support, some EPS actions do require processing by command and control elements above brigade. Common actions normally processed above brigade include awards and decorations, congressional inquiries, deletions, officer procurement, and developing EPS policies and priorities. While EPS actions are normally executed at the brigade S-1 and below, the G-1/AG at all levels has staff responsibilities for EPS actions and maintains oversight for all EPS functions. 4-3. With limited HR resources in G-1/AGs and S-1s, determining the proper HR organization to provide EPS support to assigned or attached personnel is crucial to processing efficient and timely EPS actions. This determination is also affected by whether the unit is deployable, deployed, assigned to garrison, or geographically separated from the brigade. HR CUSTOMER SERVICE 4-4. Customer service is a critical service performed by all S-1 sections as it affects a Soldier’s status, readiness, career management, benefits, and quality of life. The S-1 section is the responsible office for ensuring that assigned and attached personnel receive assistance with EPS actions and answering their questions or concerns. The S-1 section must ensure they provide the time and resources to meet the customer service needs of the personnel they support. Unit personnel expect HR systems and processes to be responsive to meet their needs. As such, S-1 sections must strive to provide the best customer service possible. At a minimum, consider the following items when developing customer service support:  Consider the time necessary to process certain EPS actions. Some customer service functions are more time consuming than others and may require research or further explanation by S-1 personnel.  Develop a plan of action for equipment failures (for example, ID tag machine not operational). The plan of action should include an alternate point for support. Units can coordinate with other units to issue ID tags when ID card machines are inoperable.  Ensure knowledgeable HR professionals are available to answer HR questions or to process EPS actions. This includes knowledge of specific documents requiring submission by the Soldier.  Adjust the customer service plan as needed. Talking with Soldiers and leaders can determine if HR customer service is adequate.  Provide a workstation for Soldiers to use. Not all Soldiers have access to HR web-based services at their unit.  Customer service hours should be sufficient in length to ensure personnel do not have to wait long for service and should not routinely change. Consider training or operational availability issues when establishing customer service hours and stagger lunches to remain operational all day. AWARDS AND DECORATIONS 4-5. The awards and decorations program enables the Army to provide Soldiers, and DOD and DA Civilians tangible recognition for valor, meritorious service, and achievements. The awards program also provides a mechanism for recognizing veterans and the primary NOK of Soldiers, members of sister Services, military personnel of multinational countries, and civilians for their meritorious contributions. Multi-name award orders should be limited in number due to privacy issues. See AR 600-8-105 for detailed information Chapter 4 4-4 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 regarding preparation of multi-name award orders. Award orders and memoranda are forwarded for placement in the AMHRR. 4-6. The approval authority for military awards and decorations is prescribed by AR 600-8-22, Military Awards; AR 672-20, Incentive Awards, for DA Civilian personnel; and DODI 1400.25, Volume 451, DOD Civilian Personnel Management System: Awards, for DOD civilian personnel. Wartime awards approval authority may be delegated to the senior Army General Officer in a documented joint command commensurate with the officer’s rank. 4-7. Initiate, process, and submit recommendations for awards and decorations through the chain of command to the approval authority. Commanders in the chain of command process the award expeditiously with the goal of presenting the award before the individual’s departure from the unit. For posthumous awards, the goal is to have the award approved for presentation to the family at the funeral. Posthumous valorous awards require special handling IAW Army policy. 4-8. Commanders may establish award boards to review award recommendations and recommend award decisions. Awards boards, if established, should reflect the composition of the command as much as possible.For example, if an organization is task organized with Regular Army and RC units, then the board should have representatives from each component. Awards and decorations are historical in nature and approval authorities maintain a record of each recommendation and decision. 4-9. During joint operations, HR elements (J-1, G-1/AG, and S-1) must determine Soldier eligibility for joint awards and decorations. During the deployment planning process, commanders with award approval level need to ensure sufficient stocks of individual awards and certificates are included. INDIVIDUAL AWARDS AND BADGES 4-10. Combat operations typically see an increase in certain individual awards. Published award criteria and processing guidance may be supplemented via military personnel messages from HQDA. Awards clerks and supervisors should frequently consult their G-1/AG or S-1 to ensure they have the most current guidance. UNIT AWARDS 4-11. Commanders authorized to approve unit awards announce awards in permanent orders of their HQ. Permanent orders are published announcing the award of a unit decoration and contain the citation of the award, name of the unit or units, and inclusive dates. All unit awards approved at HQDA are announced in HQDA General Orders. Unit commanders and military records custodians must reference AR 600-8-22, in-conjunction with personnel records, to determine and confirm entitlement of individuals to wear the insignia pertinent to each type of unit recognition. Verify all entitlements and enter in the Soldier’s personnel records IAW AR 600-8-104. Human resources elements should plan accordingly when requesting unit awards and anticipate a longer than usual processing timeline. EVALUATION REPORTS 4-12. Evaluation reports provide a systematic approach for assessing the past performance and potential of all personnel. For NCOs, warrant officers, and officers, these reports provide information to HQDA for use in making personnel management decisions that affect promotions, assignments, centralized selections, or qualitative management. For civilian personnel, evaluations assist in making decisions concerning compensation, training, rewards, reassignments, promotions, reductions in grade, retention, reductions in force, and removal. 4-13. During deployments, mobilizations, or emergencies, HQDA may implement changes to the evaluation policy. These changes may affect report periods, reasons for submission, processing procedures, processing timeliness, use of counseling checklists, and appeals procedures. The S-1 is responsible for maintaining visibility of evaluation report status to facilitate timely submission. 4-14. In addition to maintaining visibility on evaluation reports, HR leaders are the subject matter experts on all aspects of the evaluation reporting process. One specific area S-1s provide guidance with is how to manage an evaluation rating profile. Although the profile is ultimately the responsibility of each rating official, S-1s Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-5 should be prepared to discuss this topic and be ready to advise rating officials on how to maintain credible profiles that provide the flexibility to recognize top performing individuals. 4-15. AR 623-3, Evaluation Reporting System, and DA PAM 623-3, Evaluation Reporting System, provide policy and procedural guidance for processing officer and NCO evaluation reports. Forms content management facilitates the process of forwarding completed evaluation reports to the HRC for final action and placement in the AMHRR, except for ARNG NCO evaluation reports, which route to the State Enlisted Personnel Manager for processing. The DOD Civilian Personnel Management System evaluates and documents the performance of most DA Civilian personnel. The authority for DA Civilian employees is DODI 1400.25, Volume 431, DOD Civilian Personnel Management System: Performance Management and Appraisal Program. Additionally, certain Army Civilian employees are covered by alternative civilian personnel management systems which follow other prescribed performance management systems (for example, Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System, Acquisition Workforce Personnel Demonstration Project, and Science & Technology Reinvention Laboratory Personnel Demonstration Projects). RATING SCHEMES 4-16. Commanders are required to establish and maintain rating schemes for all officer, NCO, and DOD and DA Civilian personnel within their respective commands. The S-1 assists commanders by coordinating communication at all levels to ensure rating schemes are up-to-date and free of errors. Monthly checks and updates are required due to personnel turbulence units’ experience while in garrison or changes to task organization while deployed. Established rating schemes become critical tools when processing evaluation report appeals. TIMELINESS 4-17. The HQDA continues to emphasize timely and accurate submission of evaluation reports (officer, enlisted, and DA Civilian) while in garrison or deployed. The cover page of a senior rater’s Evaluation Timeliness Report, which includes information on delinquent reports (except DA Civilian and ARNG NCO evaluation reports), can be filed in that senior rater’s AMHRR if authorized by AR 600-8-104. PROMOTIONS AND REDUCTIONS 4-18. AR 600-8-19, Enlisted Promotions and Reductions, and AR 600-8-29, Officer Promotions, prescribe the enlisted promotions, reductions, and officer promotion functions of the military personnel system. Both provide principles of support, standards of service, policies, tasks, rules, and steps governing all work required in the field to support enlisted promotions and reductions and officer promotions. Both regulations also provide the objectives of the Army’s enlisted and officer promotion systems, which include filling authorized spaces with the best qualified Soldiers and officers. Further, both promotion systems provide for career progression and rank that are in line with potential and for recognition of the best qualified Soldiers and officers, which attracts and retains the highest caliber of Soldiers and officers for a career in the Army. Additionally, both systems preclude promoting Soldiers and officers who are not productive or qualified. For ARNG and USAR promotions, refer to AR 135-155, Promotion of Commissioned Officers and Warrant Officers Other Than General Officers, AR 135-156, Reserve Component General Officer Personnel Management, NGR 600-100, Commissioned Officers-Federal Recognition and Related Personnel Actions, and NGR 600-101, Warrant Officers-Federal Recognition and Related Personnel Actions. 4-19. It is important for all personnel involved in the enlisted and officer promotion system to understand Soldiers and officers from all Army components may be assigned to their organization. Each component has its own separate promotion policies, rules, and steps governing promotions. When conducting enlisted promotions at unit-level, commanders and S-1s need to be knowledgeable of USAR and ARNG promotion policies and procedures as depicted in AR 600-8-19 and the Army Mobilization and Deployment Reference, and should audit Promotion Point Worksheets to ensure compliance. For example, notification or approval may be required from the State before promoting ARNG Soldiers. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for detailed information pertaining to promotions and reductions. Chapter 4 4-6 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 TRANSFER AND DISCHARGE PROGRAM 4-20. The Transfer and Discharge Program provides a mechanism for the orderly administrative separation, transfer, or discharge (component/Service) of Soldiers for various reasons. AR 635-200, Active Duty Enlisted Administrative Separations, provides policy and procedural guidance for enlisted separations, and AR 600-8-24, Officer Transfers and Discharges, provides policy and procedural guidance for officer transfers and discharges. Title 10, United States Code, is the authority for voluntary and involuntary officer transfers. It includes the release of Other Than Regular Army officers and the discharge of Regular Army officers before the completion of their contractual obligation (both voluntary and involuntary). For ARNG and USAR separations, refer to AR 135-175, Separation of Officers, and AR 135-178, Enlisted Administrative Separations, and NGR 635-100, Termination of Appointment and Withdrawal of Federal Recognition. 4-21. The Army separation policy promotes readiness by providing a means to—  Judge suitability of personnel to serve in the Army based on conduct and ability to meet required standards of duty performance and discipline.  Achieve authorized force levels and grade distribution.  Provide for the orderly administrative separation of Soldiers. LEAVE AND PASS PROGRAM 4-22. The Leave and Pass Program promotes the maximum use of authorized absences to support health, morale, motivation, and efficiency of Soldiers. AR 600-8-10, Leaves and Passes, provides policy, procedures, and guidance for managing leave and passes, including special leave accrual and the use of R&R leave. Upon declaration of a national emergency by Executive Order of the President or upon declaration of war by the Congress, the Secretary of the Army may suspend all leaves for Soldiers. Unit commanders and S-1s are responsible for managing leave and passes. During war or contingency operations, the Army may implement procedures for special leave and pass programs (for example, environmental and morale leave and other R&R programs). All Army components are eligible for these programs. The Army G-1 publishes instructions for special leave and pass programs in the Army Mobilization and Deployment Reference. MILITARY PAY 4-23. Military pay transactions are an integrated and embedded process within the HR architecture. Battalion S-1s are the central link between Soldiers and changes to military pay entitlements, and must be familiar with DOD financial management regulations and the Joint Travel Regulation. They are responsible for resolving routine pay inquiries for their Soldiers. Military pay transactions are triggered by personnel actions and selected EPS. The S-1’s responsibilities include––  Review and submit pay inquiries to the Defense Military Pay Office.  Submit and track Unit Transmittal Letters.  Verify completion of finance actions against the Daily Report of Transactions received from the finance office.  Interpret the Leave and Earning Statement.  Ensure monthly validation of the Unit Commanders Finance Report.  Manage access and roles in the Unit Commanders Finance Report portal for subordinate units.  Advise commanders on the application of entitlements.  Execute record reviews and validate supporting documents. 4-24. Soldiers can perform limited self-service pay transactions through the My Pay portal. These capabilities include start, stop, or modify discretionary allotments and savings bonds; modify thrift savings plans; change direct deposit information; and submit employee withholding requests (W-4). 4-25. Future IPPS-A capability will automate military pay transactions based on input into the system without leveraging Unit Transmittal Letters. It is critical that HR professionals fully understand substantiating documentation required to approve pay transactions as they will be the final check on the system to ensure pay and entitlements are accurate. Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-7 OTHER HR SUPPORT 4-26. In addition to the EPS functions discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the S-1 has the following responsibilities for personnel action requests and other HR related support:  Provides the unit regulatory guidance and support as required for personnel action requests and other HR related actions.  Process personnel action requests in a timely manner. Processing includes reviewing applications; verifying (if necessary) eligibility and completeness of the action; approval or disapproval of the request; forwarding the action, with or without comment, to the HRC; or returning the action for further information or action. The S-1 section must ensure personnel action requests are processed daily, and forwards documentation to the Soldier’s AMHRR as required by DA PAM 600-8-104, Army Military Human Resource Record Management.  Be responsive and responsible in providing HR support to Soldiers and units. Providing effective and efficient HR support not only increases the morale and well-being of Soldiers, but can affect the readiness and personnel combat power of the organization. LINE OF DUTY (LOD) INVESTIGATIONS 4-27. The Army LOD program protects the interest of both the Soldier and the U.S. government where service is interrupted by injury, illness, disease, or death. An LOD investigation will be conducted for all Soldiers, regardless of component if the Soldier experiences a loss of duty time for a period of more than 24 hours and–  The injury, illness, or disease is of lasting significance (to be determined by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner).  There is a likelihood that the injury, illness, or disease will result in a permanent disability.  If an RC Soldier requires follow-on care for an injury, illness, or disease incurred during a period of active duty (see AR 600-8-4, Line of Duty Policy, Procedures, and Investigations, for Service-aggravated conditions). 4-28. Although LOD investigations begin with the unit commander, per AR 600-8-4, the S-1 has overall responsibility for the management and processing of LODs involving injury, illness, or disease. The S-1 will also update the Soldier’s record accordingly in the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System. In coordination with the unit’s servicing Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, the S-1 will forward all death cases and not in line of duty recommendations to the Commander, U.S. Army Human Resources Command for final review and disposition. 4-29. Depending on the circumstances of the case, a formal LOD investigation may not be required. Only the U.S. Army Human Resources Command can make a presumptive in line of duty finding per AR 600-8-4. Presumptive in line of duty determinations may be made when cases involve the following situations:  In the case of injuries clearly incurred because of enemy action or attack by terrorists.  In the case of death due to natural causes.  Injury or death as a passenger in a common commercial carrier or military aircraft or vehicle. ARMY REGULATION 15-6 INVESTIGATIONS 4-30. AR 15-6, Procedures for Administrative Investigations and Boards of Officers, prescribes methods for conducting formal and informal investigations into allegations of misconduct or negligence or into the circumstances surrounding a serious incident or a fatality. Depending on the reason for and the type of investigation, only certain personnel as prescribed in AR 15-6, paragraph 2-1, may act as an appointing authority. Additionally, the appointed investigating officer or board of officers is required to consult with the legal advisor designated in the investigation appointment memorandum before an investigation begins. AR 15-6 investigations are required for many categories of Soldier, DA Civilian, or contractor deaths. These categories include hostile deaths, military-related fatal accidents, and suspected suicides. The S-1 coordinates with the staff judge advocate’s office so legal counsel may initiate the necessary appointment memorandum for designated individuals. For individuals under investigation, commanders must ensure favorable personnel Chapter 4 4-8 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 actions are suspended IAW the criteria contained in AR 600-8-2, Suspension of Favorable Personnel Actions (Flag). SUSPENSION OF FAVORABLE PERSONNEL ACTIONS AND BARS TO CONTINUED SERVICE 4-31. Suspension of favorable personnel actions prevent and/or preclude execution of favorable actions to a Soldier who may not be in an unfavorable status (not in good standing), to include movement of a Soldier when it is in the best interest of the Army for the Soldier to remain in their current unit or at their current location. See AR 600-8-2 for specific policies regarding suspension of favorable personnel actions. 4-32. Bars to continued service are initiated on Soldiers whose immediate separation under administrative procedures is not warranted, but whose reentry into or service beyond their expiration term of service with the Regular Army is not in the best interest of the military service. Policies and procedures for bars to continued service are contained in AR 601-280.While bars to continued service are initiated in coordination with the brigade retention NCO and the Soldier’s commander, S-1s as HR managers monitor these actions. CITIZENSHIP AND NATURALIZATION 4-33. Battalion S-1s have the following citizenship and naturalization responsibilities:  Assist non-citizen Soldiers with their applications for citizenship to include cover sheets, fingerprint cards, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form N-426 (Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service). The DOD collaborates with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to assist non-citizen military members with their citizenship applications. The goal is to streamline and expedite the handling of their applications. Battalion S-1s serve as the conduit to assist Soldiers with their applications and to coordinate with the HRC as necessary to facilitate the process. Soldiers and S-1 personnel can obtain naturalization forms, request a Military Packet, and obtain a copy of the handbook, A Guide to Naturalization, by visiting the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website.  Verify the application and service data and then complete the backside of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Form N-426.  Certify the character of the Soldier’s service is honorable. Generally, a Soldier is serving honorably unless a decision has been made to the contrary by the Soldier’s commander or a conviction by court martial.  Send an email message to the appropriate overseas U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office after mailing the Soldier’s citizenship application packet. The email must contain the Soldier’s name, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services number, social security number, date of birth, email address, current or projected country of assignment or deployment, current or projected (if available) mailing address, and the projected date of arrival in country per the Soldier’s permanent change of station or deployment orders.  Process posthumous citizenship applications for deceased Soldiers. 4-34. Deploying non-citizen Soldiers who have applications for citizenship pending must call the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Customer Service to inform them of mailing address changes when they occur. Soldiers with pending applications for citizenship are reminded of this requirement during Soldier Readiness Processing, during in- or out-processing, mobilization, extended TDY, deployment, redeployment, and reintegration (for example, personnel processing upon return from a deployment). Soldiers who fail to notify the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services of changes to their mailing address will risk denial of citizenship due to lack of response to notices of action from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES 4-35. Congressional inquiries are specific requests made by members of Congress. Normally, commanders are required to respond to congressional inquiries within a designated timeline and format. While congressional inquiries are not always HR specific, the commander designates the G-1/AG and/or S-1 to process these actions. The G-1/AG and/or S-1 must ensure congressional inquiries are processed within designated timelines. Refer to AR 1-20, Legislative Liaison, for further information regarding congressional inquiries. Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-9 IDENTIFICATION CARDS AND TAGS 4-36. An ID card provides a means to identify personnel entitled to specific DOD benefits and to identify personnel who require an ID card as outlined in DODI 1000.01, Identification (ID) Cards Required by the Geneva Conventions. Policy, procedures, and the type of card to be issued is determined by DODM 1000.13, Volume 1, DoD Identification (ID) Cards: ID Card Life-Cycle, AR 600-8-14, Identification Cards for Members of the Uniformed Services, Their Family Members, and Other Eligible Personnel {AFI 36-3026_ IPV1/AR 600-8-14/BUPERS INST 1750.10D/MCO 5512.11E/COMDTINST M5512.1B/NOAA Corps Directives, Chapter 1, Part 5/Commissioned Corps Manual 29.2/Instructions 1 and 2}, and AR 690-11, Department of the Army Expeditionary Civilian Workforce and Civilian Deployments, In Support of Military Contingency and Emergency Operations. Common access cards are the standard for Service member ID cards. The brigade or STB S-1 (General Officer-level) issues CACs for assigned or attached personnel; the TG PAT may provide CAC services, if required, to personnel transiting through the theater gateway. Common access cards and ID cards are used to––  Identify Soldiers (Active and retired), members of other Services, and their family members.  Identify DOD and DA Civilians, CAAF, and prisoners of war.  Provide a means to identify, control access, and track civilians (physical security).  Expedite access to stored, sharable personnel data. 4-37. Identification tags are required to be worn while deployed overseas, in a field environment, and while traveling in an aircraft. Brigade or STB S-1s issue ID tags for assigned or attached personnel and by the TG PAT for transiting personnel. 4-38. In preparing for deployments, brigade S-1s must ensure the early entry element of the S-1 has the capability to provide CACs. As such, brigade S-1s must ensure the deployable Real-Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS) workstation and supporting communications equipment ships early in the deployment process. Deployed S-1s must coordinate with the rear detachment S-1 and battalion or brigade signal staff officer (S-6) a minimum of 90 days before deployment to process the RAPIDS accreditation packet through the servicing network enterprise center. 4-39. Civilians (DOD and DA Civilians and CAAF) are required to obtain a CAC before deploying to a theater of operations. In cases of lost or destroyed CACs, civilians can obtain a CAC from the AFSB S-1, the TG PAT, or from a near-by brigade S-1. Brigade S-1s supporting a large population of CAAF (including other designated contractor personnel) need to ensure sufficient number of replacement cards are on-hand. Guidelines for issuing and verifying eligibility for CACs for civilians remain the same as outlined in AR 600-8-14. Additionally, CAAF (including other designated contractor personnel) must be entered in the Trusted Associate Sponsorship System. TALENT MANAGEMENT 4-40. Talent management is transformational, increasing organizational agility, focusing on productivity, and manifests as readiness and lethality. It also integrates al people practices, generating a positive effect on organizational outcomes and leveraging each individual’s knowledge, skills, behaviors, and preferences (KSB-P) for the mutual benefit of the Army and the individual (based on The Army People Strategy reference). Talent management extracts the most productivity and value from an organization’s greatest asset–its people. Army talent management integrates people acquisition, development, employment, and retention strategies. It begins with entry-level personnel and aligns their talents against the demand for them during their entire careers, to include positions at the very top of the Army. Talent management provides an opportunity for the HR community to dominate the human capital arena if properly executed. Human resources professionals should be experts in talent management initiatives and processes. 4-41. Talent is defined as the unique intersection of the KSB-P inherent in Army professionals:  Knowledge – Facts, information, and skills acquired by a personal experience, education, or training.  Skills – The ability to apply knowledge to a task.  Behaviors – The way one acts or conducts oneself, especially toward others.  Preferences – Interests, career ambitions, and personal life goals. Chapter 4 4-10 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 4-42. The Army must effectively manage diverse talent for a complex world by optimizing the human performance of every Soldier and civilian in the Army total force and by building cohesive teams of trusted professionals who thrive in ambiguity and chaos. The Army must also optimize talent management through work force planning and the acquisition, employment, development, and retention of Army professionals. Teams that are built better and comprised of the right individuals will improve the Army. The Army must take a holistic approach to support human capital management transformation by implementing and sustaining policies and practices that will optimize talent management. 4-43. The Army Talent Alignment Process (ATAP) is a decentralized regulated assignment marketplace operationalized through the Assignment Interactive Module 2.0, and in the future, within IPPS-A. The process incentivizes the exchange of accurate and granular KSB-P improving alignment of the Army talent supply with unit talent demands utilizing three phases: set the market, execute the market, and clear the market. Phase I – Set the Market 4-44. A commander and unit have various roles and responsibilities during the ATAP. Commanders can delegate some of these roles to maximize the efficiency of their talent search. A unit commander, brigade executive officer, brigade S-1, or brigade strength manager cannot be solely responsible for preparing a unit to navigate the ATAP. While the process may be time consuming, establishing lines of effort, task organizing, and taking a team approach to the process will pay dividends to the unit. It is highly recommended that units create an internal conference style meeting before a manning cycle to maximize efforts for talent management. Commanders and brigade S-1s/strength managers should refer to The Commander’s Guide to ATAP as a resource to navigate the ATAP for their officer populations. 4-45. The Set the Market phase begins with identifying unit position vacancies and officers available to move, and ends with validating both the unit positions to be filled and the population of officers available. Units inventory their officers, validate projected position vacancies, and post detailed positon descriptions within the Assignment Interactive Module 2.0 describing the KSB-P desired for the positions. Officers identified to move, update their resumes in the module, describing the unique KSB-P they possess. The HRC validates the list of vacant positions IAW officers available, manning priorities, and senior leader guidance. 4-46. Human resources professionals can assist commands in identifying all movers, vacancies, determining priority of position vacancies, and recording the desired KSB-P of inbound officers. It is recommended that the brigade S-1 or brigade strength manager conduct a variety of strength management actions to include—  Validate and Adjust Year/Month Available to Move for verified officers identified to move as soon as possible before Phase I, Set the Market.  Submit Mission Essential Requirements through the ATAP in the Assignment Interactive Module 2.0.  Fill out information and KSB-Ps for each advertised position. It is critical for the brigade S-1 or strength manager to keep this information up-to-date throughout the ATAP market.  Rank order all position vacancies to indicate the commander’s priority of fill to inform HRC of the commander’s requirements list, enabling validation of priority vacancies within a unit. Phase II – Execute the Market 4-47. This phase begins when the ATAP opens and ends with a predetermined date-time-group published by the HRC. After a unit submits its mission essential requirements for the upcoming ATAP cycle, the HRC will execute their internal processes for validating requirements. Requirements will be validated based on Active Component manning guidance. The process opens with officers reviewing unit position vacancies, interacting with unit points of contact or the position incumbent to gather more information, and then indicating their desired assignments in rank order. Units assess available officers’ resumes, dialogue with interested officers and officers who may have yet to express interest, conduct interviews, and preference available officers in rank order. Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-11 Phase III – Clear the Market 4-48. This phase begins with the conclusion of the market and ends with officers receiving their request for orders. Commanders will ensure that officers inbound to their unit are sponsored IAW Army regulations. The brigade S-1 confirms incoming officer data and provides the unit commander with the data before the officer’s arrival. Officer and unit preferences will be the primary factors to determine assignment matches. Professional development and senior leader guidance are secondary assignment considerations. Note: While the current marketplace processes only apply to Active Duty officer and warrant officer cohorts, the Army is engaged along multiple lines of effort among all cohorts to create a modern talent management program. Many of the new policies around promotions, evaluations, and accessions are designed to attract, develop, and retain talent. HR DIVISION OF LABOR 4-49. Human resources organizations, such as the installation Directorate of HR, are important partners in the overall HR support plan for units and organizations. The installation Directorate of HR provides HR support to all table of distribution and allowances units and table of organization and equipment units, battalion and below, that are geographically separated from their brigade. This partnership requires planning and preparation to ensure uninterrupted HR support to units and Soldiers whether they are deployed or at home station. Army National Guard Joint Forces Headquarters and USAR geographic commands respectively perform similar functions in the military personnel division for the ARNG and Reserve in non-deployed environments. To determine where organizational level HR support is conducted, leaders should use the following guidance:  Tasks performed by table of organization and equipment units while in garrison and deployed are performed by S-1 sections at brigade and battalion-levels (for example, awards and decorations, issuance of CACs and ID tags, promotions and advancements, and PASR). The installation Directorate of HR may provide selected support to non-deployed table of organization and equipment units geographically separated from their battalion or brigade S-1. This support may include issuance of CACs and promotions. Note: The IMCOM will not have a role in promotions once IPPS-A is live in December 2021. Home station units will have visibility of Soldiers across installations and will be able to generate reports and perform transactions associated with promotions.  Tasks performed while in garrison only are performed by the installation directorate of HR (for example, retirement processing, mobilization and demobilization, Transfer and Discharge Program, Army Career and Alumni Program, and centralized in- and out-processing). Army National Guard Joint Forces Headquarters and USAR sustainment commands perform similar functions in the military personnel division for the ARNG and Reserve in their garrison environments.  Tasks performed while deployed only are performed by HR organizations (for example, postal and wartime casualty operations). REAR DETACHMENT HR RESPONSIBILITIES 4-50. An important unit function during deployment is rear detachment operations. The rear detachment assumes the daily workload of the deployed unit and provides home station support for the unit. The rear detachment leadership maintains regular contact with the deployed unit and is responsible for the administrative operations of the rear detachment, including maintaining command and control, accounting for unit property and equipment, and managing personnel. Regardless of availability of HR professionals in the rear detachment, the rear detachment leadership is required to maintain these responsibilities IAW Army policy. Chapter 4 4-12 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 4-51. An important function of the rear detachment is serving as a vital communications link between the deployed unit and family members. The rear detachment’s mission works in tandem with that of the deployed commander and provides support to Soldiers and families at the lowest level. 4-52. Rear detachments should be established at two levels (brigade and battalion) to perform the functions listed below. Human resources roles and responsibilities for rear detachments are—  Publish the rear detachment assumption of command order.  Establish and maintain two-way communication with forward deployed units to facilitate the flow of timely and accurate HR support and information, and to resolve HR issues that cannot be solved by the rear detachment.  Provide HR support to brigade, battalion, and/or company rear detachments. Maintain PASR of non-deployed Soldiers and closely track casualties, family issues, and wounded-warrior care.  Execute, coordinate, or synchronize HR operations and HR support for rear detachment personnel.  Maintain connectivity to HR systems and input/update rear detachment changes as needed.  Provide custodian verification of emergency data (DD Form 93 and Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Certificate of Coverage) as casualties occur.  Coordinate installation support for rear detachment personnel and families of deployed personnel (for example, CAC and ID cards, housing, and vehicle registration).  Coordinate with the deployed S-1 and S-3 for call forward of personnel.  Develop and maintain rating schemes for rear detachment personnel.  Ensure adherence to customer service hours of operation, procedures for accountability, and receipt of mail.  Provide HR support to Soldiers temporarily returned from deployment.  Support planning for reception of unit personnel upon redeployment.  Serve as coordinator between deployed HR elements, home station, and higher echelon HR support organizations.  Maintain a family readiness group leader on appointment orders.  Conduct or support casualty notification as defined in the unit SOP and IAW the installation casualty assistance center.  Coordinate with the ARC regarding emergency information on Soldiers and family members. This includes logging, tracking, and processing Red Cross emergency messages and notifying the forward unit of impending ARC messages.  Maintain a roster of Soldiers trained and certified for appointment as casualty notification officer and casualty assistance officer when a casualty occurs; monitor the performance of those Soldiers assigned as casualty notification and assistance officers.  Ensure trained Soldiers are available for appointment as summary court martial officers and LOD investigating officers as needed. 4-53. To ensure continuity of HR operations during deployments, it is crucial that rear detachments be established and operational as far in advance of the deployment as possible. This not only ensures rear detachment HR operations are properly functioning before deployment, but enables deploying S-1 personnel to participate in unit pre-deployment training. 4-54. When considering which HR professionals should be part of the rear detachment, brigade and battalion S-1s must ensure selected personnel are familiar with HR operations. Human resources professionals designated to be members of the rear detachment should fully understand the HR relationships with family readiness group, installation HR support, and community resource activities. As HR professionals will likely be involved in HR support to casualty operations, it is recommended the command select a senior NCO who demonstrates the professional characteristics of competence, character, and commitment as well as maturity and compassion. Human resources rear detachment professionals also deal with family members, and as such, should have good leadership and communication skills and have some experience in dealing with family support issues. Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-13 4-55. The key to successful HR operations include—  Establish HR rear detachment operations early.  Work as a team with the deployed S-1, rear detachment commander, and the family readiness group.  Be knowledgeable of HR policies and be proficient with HR databases and systems required to perform the HR mission.  Possess strong communication, listening, and people skills.  Ensure to detail individual roles and responsibilities in the rear detachment SOP.  Cross-train HR professionals.  Maintain and foster genuine care and concern for family needs.  Coordinate with the S-3 training NCO to ensure all qualified rear detachment personnel receive training on casualty notification and assistance procedures. SECTION II – POSTAL OPERATIONS 4-56. The MPS is operated as an extension of the USPS as authorized by 39 U.S.C. § 406 and IAW the domestic agreement between DOD and USPS which is known as USPS Publication 38, Postal Agreement between the United States Postal Service and the Department of Defense. The DOD and the USPS agreed to furnish mail services to the military as close as practical to that provided to the civilian population in the United States. 4-57. Postal operations have a significant effect on the morale of Soldiers and their families. General George Patton preached to his unit commanders after Operation MARKET GARDEN (October 1944) the critical necessity of maintaining morale. General Patton stated, “This required getting the Soldiers the best food available, including as many hot meals as possible, and, even more important, ensuring that mail from home reached every Soldier rapidly and regularly.” Just as Patton had demanded the utmost of all unit commanders in combat, now he called on them to move heaven and earth to get fresh food when, supposedly, only C and K rations were available, and to prod their G-3s into giving mail the highest priority. 4-58. Depending on the combatant commander's priorities, mail service could be available within the first 30 days of operations. Postal operations consist of a network of military HR organizations. Efficient and effective postal operations require dedicated postal organizations with trained postal clerks and HR leaders knowledgeable of postal operations laws, regulations, and procedures needed in the execution of providing postal services globally to deployed units and personnel. There are two types of postal mission support: general and direct support. General support missions are normally assigned to an MMT but can also be assigned to a MPO supporting on an area basis. Direct support missions are normally assigned to an MPO but can also be assigned to a MMT when multiple MMTs are assigned to a theater due to size and dispersion. Mail delivery to DOD patrons is through either an MPO or a unit mailroom for both personal and official mail. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for more detailed information on processing mail and providing postal services. PROPONENCY 4-59. The Army’s functional proponent for the postal operations management system is The Adjutant General Directorate, HRC. The Adjutant General is also the executive director for the MPSA. The DOD 4525.6-M and AR 600-8-3, Postal Operations, provides mandatory policy and procedural guidance for postal operations management during military operations. Statutory requirements are found in United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations listed by topic in the above references. ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES 4-60. Units and agencies listed in the following paragraphs have critical roles during various stages of the deployment, sustainment, and redeployment process in establishing, executing, and managing MPS support for deployed forces. Chapter 4 4-14 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 MILITARY POSTAL SERVICE AGENCY 4-61. The Secretary of the Army is the DOD executive agent for the MPS. The MPSA operates under that authority, direction, and control to oversee the MPS, which operates globally as an extension of the USPS consistent with public law, federal regulations, and international and domestic agreements providing postal services to all DOD patrons in deployed and non-deployed environments. The MPSA is the single DOD point of contact with USPS HQ. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific responsibilities of the MPSA. JOINT MILITARY POSTAL ACTIVITY 4-62. The JMPA is a subordinate organization of MPSA collocated at the USPS international and military service center and is the single point of contact with the USPS at the postal gateways. The JMPA coordinates mail routing schemes, surface containers, supply and equipment requests, and facilitates processing and transportation of military mail. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific responsibilities of the JMPA. DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY POSTAL 4-63. The DA Postal provides oversight of all Army postal functions as part of the MPS to ensure efficient postal services are provided to all authorized personnel and activities within CONUS and outside of CONUS during LSCO and other operations. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific responsibilities of the DA Postal. SERVICE POSTAL MANAGER 4-64. The SPM implements and coordinates postal operations throughout the joint operations area (JOA) under the authority of the combatant commander or joint force postal staff, and serves as the liaison between the operational area and MPSA. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific responsibilities of the SPM. ASCC G-1/AG 4-65. The ASCC G-1/AG is responsible for postal operations within their AO. While the G-1/AG does not execute postal operations, it is the agency responsible for developing postal policies, priorities, guidelines, and monitoring postal operations within the theater. The ASCC G-1/AG accomplishes this in coordination with the TSC/ESC and TPOC. All policies developed should adhere to joint policy guidelines. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific postal operations responsibilities of the ASCC G-1/AG. CORPS G-1/AG AND DIVISION G-1 4-66. Corps G-1/AGs and division G-1s monitor unit mailroom operations for their assigned or attached units. If serving as the Army Forces G-1, the corps G-1/AG and division G-1 performs the duties and responsibilities of the theater G-1/AG. The corps G-1/AG and division G-1 do not have postal assets; however, the corps and division as a command does. All postal issues or requirements are coordinated directly with the supporting APO or HROB within the supporting sustainment brigade. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific unit mailroom responsibilities of the corps G-1/AG and division G-1. BRIGADE AND BATTALION S-1 4-67. Brigade and battalion S-1s develop and coordinate unit mailroom operations for their respective assigned and attached units. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific unit mailroom responsibilities of the brigade and battalion S-1. TPOC, POSTAL OPERATIONS DIVISION 4-68. The TPOC POD plans, integrates, synchronizes, and coordinates postal operations support within a theater of operations by serving as the bridge between the ASCC G-1/AG and the TSC. The TPOC POD provides postal assistance and technical guidance to the MMT and HROBs and ensures they comply with postal operations policies and regulations. The TPOC POD directly supports the execution of theater postal policies and the EPW mail mission. The division identifies appropriate resources to support the theater postal Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-15 mission, particularly during LSCO when the postal flow depends heavily on METT-TC and the combatant commander's guidance. Specific responsibilities of the TPOC POD include, but are not limited to––  Plan and coordinate with the combatant command and SPM to request and ensure appropriate MPS resources (for example, host-nation support, transportation, facilities, and equipment) are assigned for the execution of postal responsibilities in the AO.  Participate with the TSC, ESC, HROB, and theater G-1/AG in planning, executing, and assessing postal operations for theater.  Coordinate with the ASCC G-1/AG for policy guidance and resourcing by the TSC (for example, postal elements, facilities, transportation, and equipment).  Appoint a theater and assistant postal finance officer to ensure establishment and functionality of postal finance accounting and claims policies and procedures. This includes providing daily postal finance support to finance clerks within MPOs.  Appoint the theater postal supply officer to coordinate all theater-level postal supplies, equipment accountability, and ordering.  Provide technical guidance to the MMT and HROB.  Provide technical guidance and postal compliance support to all subordinate HROBs.  Assist the ESC HROB in the establishment of theater opening postal operations.  Establish the deployed AO postal inspection plan to ensure compliance with the USPS and DOD regulatory guidance.  Establish direct coordination with both the MPSA and the servicing JMPA, and conduct detailed postal planning and coordination with the MPSA.  Ensure DOD and DA Civilian, CAAF, and multinational support requirements are determined and disseminated.  Monitor and determine appropriate mail flow rates and ensure current data integrates into all TSC and ESC DMC planning.  Ensure postal operations are included in OPLANs and OPORDs.  Maintain a list of all theater postal delivery points and immediately post and distribute changes to postal organizations.  Coordinate with the TSC, ESC for augmentation support for postal elements. (Note: This may be necessary during peak holidays periods).  Coordinate theater-level training for MPO representatives to ensure compliance with DOD and USPS policies and procedures.  Develop procedures for postal support of the Service component command’s voting program.  Plan and coordinate with the SPM, TSC, ESC, and HROB for MPO openings, closings, and relocations when standing-up a theater of operations.  Ensure the manning and operation of MMTs and mail control activities in coordination with the theater SPM and/or theater Air Force postal representative.  Consult with SPM and JMPA to develop mail routing instructions and procedures for optimum mail delivery in theater.  Plan and provide unit mail routing information to the servicing JMPA in coordination with the MMT.  Ensure the theater postal locater and procedures for casualty mail and redirect services are established.  Responsible for the local theater unit locator service.  Assist the HROB as necessary in the coordination of theater-level mail transportation support for mail movement to and from all necessary locations.  Manage the theater EPW mail plan and monitor the execution of EPW mail.  Coordinate requests for coalition mail support.  Employ, establish, and develop suspicious mail procedures. Ensure MPO personnel at all levels are knowledgeable of policies, procedures, and guidance related to suspicious mail incidents. Chapter 4 4-16 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Collect postal statistical and historical workload information from postal units to identify trends, inefficiencies, and improve postal network services from the HROB.  Postal Assessment and Assistance team conduct inspections/audits and assist locations with on-site training as needed.  Implement procedures for responding to congressional inquiries, customer complaints, inquiries, and suggestions.  Review statements of work in coordination with the supporting contracting office to ensure level of support remains consistent within theater.  Consider host-nation postal limitations and restrictions and work with MPSA to implement for prograde and retrograde mail. MILITARY MAIL TERMINAL TEAM 4-69. The MMT is the primary gateway(s) for postal operations in and out of the deployed AO. It coordinates, receives, and processes prograde mail, and dispatches retrograde mail to destinations worldwide. With their specialized postal expertise and experience, the MMT team aligned to an HR company HQ, and postal platoons establish and provide the Army component of a joint MMT team at the inter-theater APOD. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific responsibilities and detailed duties of the MMT team. HROB 4-70. The ESC and DSB/sustainment brigade HROBs are responsible for planning, coordinating, integrating, synchronizing postal operations support by serving as the key integrator between G-1/AGs, DMC/SPOs, and SRC 12 HR organizations attached, assigned, and supported within a designated AO. The HROB provides technical guidance from the TPOC and operational guidance from command and control channels to SRC 12 HR organizations to ensure they are resourced, positioned, and properly allocated to provide postal support. During LSCO, postal flow operations will depend heavily on METT-TC and the combatant commander's guidance.Postal platoons are multi-functional and can be dedicated to personnel accounting or casualty missions when necessary. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific postal responsibilities of the HROB. HR COMPANY 4-71. The HR company provides command and control, short and long term planning, and technical guidance to subordinate postal and HR platoons and MMT (if performing the MMT mission). The HR company is under the command and control of the sustainment brigade STB/combat sustainment support battalion or DSB STB and receives technical guidance from the MMT and HROB. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific responsibilities of the HR company. POSTAL PLATOON 4-72. The mission of the postal platoon is to provide postal support to all individuals and units in an assigned AO, to include providing mobile mail teams, or to serve as an element of an MMT. Postal platoons operate under the command and control of the HR company HQ and receive technical guidance from the HQ plans and operations section and MMT. All postal platoons must be trained on and capable of conducting personnel accounting and casualty reporting HR squad functions (with additional access and equipment – for example, Tactical Personnel System scanners) as needed during operations. Limited SRC 12 HR structure and available resources will require this multi-functional capacity, especially during early entry and theater opening operations for LSCO. Postal platoons must be able to perform these functions until the remaining HR units are in theater and operational. Personnel from the postal platoon may serve as contracting officer representatives overseeing contracted postal operations. Refer to ATP 1-0.2 for specific responsibilities of the postal platoon. Note: Postal platoon structure is being examined to determine if all assigned Soldiers require formal postal training (additional skill identifier F4/F5). Although it provides additional flexibility for finance services in the platoon, it may not be an efficient use of available resources (for example, training time for the force). Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-17 BATTLEFIELD FLOW 4-73. During LSCO, the combatant commander determines mail flow priorities based on METT-TC. Prior to deployment, the ASCC G-1/AG determines the initial postal support requirements in coordination with the combatant commands, other Service components, and the supporting TSC TPOC. In determining the requirements, the ASCC G-1/AG considers the infrastructure in the AO, deployment timing, force composition, and expected deployment duration. Through operational analysis and with input from the TSC, the ASCC determines what postal unit structure is necessary to support the operation and where to place the MMT within the AO. The normal postal unit requirement for supporting a deployed force is one MMT per inter-theater APOD receiving bulk mail, a postal platoon providing postal finance services support for up to 6,000 Soldiers and DOD and DA Civilians, and a HR company for every three to seven postal platoons. Depending on the scope and expected duration of an operation, postal platoons and/or HR companies deploy with the main body of the operational Army. A trained and fully equipped postal unit requires a minimum of 48 hours to establish postal operations. Postal units must be established before the movement of mail in or out of the AO. All METT-TC considerations must be addressed. 4-74. The USPS sorts mail based on their physical plant capacities and works with DOD to provide sortation to ZIP Codes and more specifically to geographic areas or major cluster of military personnel, and not necessarily tied to a unit. To support force deployment, the MPSA, in coordination with the USPS, operational combatant commands, and Service component commands, assigns ZIP Codes to forces after requirements have been met (for example, postal personnel and equipment, logistics transportation, and host-nation agreement concerns); these requirements are processed through the Automated Military Postal System. The ZIP Code may be provided to a unit before deployment, but only if all the prerequisites for that ZIP Code have been met. The MPSA also coordinates with the JMPA for mail transportation from CONUS to the JOA. During operations, intra/inter-theater mail may be transported by commercial, contract, or military ground, sea, rail, and air transportation segments. 4-75. Upon notification from MPSA, the USPS sorts and packages mail, in time of war or emergency, as determined by the Secretary of Defense. The postal service agrees to––  Allow the DOD to control ZIP Code assignment to all military units.  Specify jointly with the MPSA the sorting of mail for overseas forces. 4-76. The HR company and subordinate postal platoons located at the MMT receive the mail and distribute it to HR companies supporting subordinate corps and division units, or postal platoons supporting subordinate brigades. The postal platoon(s) receives mail dispatched from the MMT, sorts it by supported units, and prepares it for dispatch to designated mail delivery points. Company and battalion mail clerks pick-up mail from the mail delivery point and coordinate delivery to addressees. Mail clerks coordinate collection of retrograde mail from unit Soldiers and deliver it daily to the mail delivery point at the same time as pick-up of unit mail. The same transportation used to deliver mail to delivery points transports retrograde mail, to include casualty mail, in reverse through the postal network. Figure 4-1 on page 4-18 depicts the mail flow from CONUS to unit/Soldier. See ATP 1-0.2 for further information regarding mail flow. Chapter 4 4-18 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 Figure 4-1. Mail flow 4-77. The initial standard for the JOA is restricted mail service, including restrictions imposed by the host-nation. Mail is limited to first-class mail items, including audio and video media, weighing 13 ounces or less. The commander may lift restrictions and permit parcels as the JOA matures, more postal personnel become available, and the theater ground transportation and airlift logistical systems mature. 4-78. It is important to note that organic transportation assets within units performing postal missions are structured to move assigned personnel and equipment, not mail. The postal operations management network must coordinate all inbound and outbound mail transportation requirements with transportation managers at each level of command, from the MMT to the brigade mail delivery point. Ultimately, effective mail movement requires assured military, contracted, and/or host-nation transportation support. The standard mail delivery time from CONUS to the JOA MMT is 14 days’ contingent upon a developed transportation network and METT-TC. Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-19 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion (Women’s Army Corps) In February 1945, warehouses in Birmingham, England were filled with millions of pieces of mail intended for members of the U.S. military, U.S. government personnel, and Red Cross workers serving in the European theater. Airplane hangars held undelivered Christmas packages, and a constant stream of incoming mail added to the already massive backlog of letters and packages. Oftentimes the mail was addressed simply to “Junior, U.S. Army” or “Buster, U.S. Army.” As Allied forces drove across Europe, ever-changing locations hampered mail delivery to service members. With seven million Americans in the European theater, many shared common names (7,500 were named Robert Smith). Service members noticed that they weren’t getting mail from home, and Army officials reported that the lack of reliable mail delivery was hurting morale. One General predicted that the backlog in Birmingham would take six months to process. But who would take on this massive task? Under the heading of “Personnel Problems,” an Adjutant General’s report stated that, “Since D-Day, and for a long time prior to that date, a shortage of qualified postal officers has existed within the [European] theater. The Postal Division continually sought to secure additional officers by requisition from the Reinforcement System and from the Zone of the Interior.” Although there were personnel stationed at Birmingham to handle the mail, the system was in chaos. A law signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 1 July 1943 created the Women’s Army Corps of the U.S. Army. In November 1944, a battalion of all African-American women drawn from the Women’s Army Corps, the Army Service Forces, and the Army Air Forces, was created and eventually designated as the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, nicknamed “Six Triple Eight.” In February 1945, the first contingent of “Six Triple Eight” arrived in Birmingham, England; the second contingent arrived 50 days later. Upon their arrival, they confronted warehouses stacked to the ceiling with letters and packages. These buildings were unheated and dimly lit, the windows blacked out to prevent light showing during nighttime air raids. Additionally, rats had sought out packages of spoiled cakes and cookies. The unit members were organized into three separate eight-hour shifts so work continued around the clock, seven days a week. They tracked individual service members by maintaining about seven million information cards including serial numbers to distinguish different individuals with the same name. The women dealt with “undeliverable” mail that was sent to their location for redirection. They investigated insufficiently addressed mail for clues to determine the intended recipient, and they handled the sad duty of returning mail addressed to service members who had died. With the new tracking system they created, the women processed an average of 65,000 pieces of mail per shift and cleared the six-month backlog of mail in three months. The women adhered to the motto of, “no mail, low morale,” providing essential support of the U.S. military in the European theater by linking service members to their loved ones back home. They achieved unprecedented success and efficiency in solving the military’s postal problems. OTHER POSTAL INFORMATION 4-79. The following paragraphs discuss additional elements of postal operations. Chapter 4 4-20 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 ACCOUNTABLE MAIL 4-80. Accountable mail is registered, insured, certified, signature confirmation, return receipt for merchandise or express military mail service. Postal platoons receive, sort, and dispatch accountable personal mail to appointed unit mail clerks IAW DOD 4525.6-M. Once received, unit mail clerks maintain chain of custody with appropriate documentation through delivery to the recipient. Unit mail clerks ensure accountable mail is properly secured IAW DOD 4525.6-M. Return undeliverable accountable mail to the servicing APO the following day with the appropriate endorsements. CASUALTY MAIL 4-81. Casualty mail processed within the mail distribution system requires special attention to prevent premature casualty information disclosure and mail returned home before NOK notification. Casualty mail consists of unopened mail in the delivery system that has been received by the unit mail clerk for a Soldier or DOD and DA Civilian who has become a casualty (injured, wounded, deceased, missing or ill). When processing casualty mail, unit mail clerks validate the Soldier’s location, hold the mail for the Soldier’s return, forward the mail to the MTF, or return to the servicing postal platoon. Undelivered casualty mail will be labeled as “Search,” forwarded to theater-level casualty section, and verified there before it is returned to the sender or forwarded to NOK. The APO forwards casualty mail to the casualty mail section for processing. The postal platoon verifies casualty information; makes appropriate endorsements, then forwards casualty mail to the theater casualty section at the MMT for final processing. Note: Any mail that has been previously opened by the Soldier is considered personal effects and is shipped with the rest of the Soldier’s belongings. CONTAMINATED AND SUSPICIOUS MAIL 4-82. The postal network must make special provisions for handling and processing contaminated and suspicious mail IAW postal regulations. Suspicious mail items may consist of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive materials. The postal network screens for contaminated and suspicious mail and stops the mail flow when discovered. Any suspicious looking package or letter should be considered a potential bomb or hazard and should be treated accordingly. ENEMY PRISONER OF WAR MAIL 4-83. The Geneva Convention, relative to the treatment of prisoners of war, identifies the need for EPW mail operations. The Army G-1 coordinates with the Provost Marshal, an appropriate international neutral agency, and an American neutral agency to assess EPW mail requirements. The ASCC G-1/AG coordinates with the TSC to identify a postal platoon to handle EPW mail. FREE MAIL 4-84. Free mail is authorized by Executive Order 12556, Mailing Privileges of Members of Armed Forces of the United States and of Friendly Foreign Nations, and Title 39, USC 3401(a), as determined by the Secretary of Defense. Free mail is a privilege specifically granted by this law and intended solely to expedite transmission of military members’ personal letter and mail correspondence to the U.S. in times of operational contingency in arduous circumstances or armed conflict including LSCO. Free mail privileges apply to Service members in a declared free mail operational area as well as those hospitalized in a facility under military jurisdiction because of service in the designated area. 4-85. Free mail is limited by Title 39, USC 3401 (a) to personal letters or sound recorded correspondence (to include video tapes) and must be addressed to a place within the delivery limits of the USPS or MPS. Free mail privileges normally are not allowed when mail is processed, handled, or delivered by a foreign postal administration. The Army/ASCC requests free mail through the combatant commander for the specific theater and is considered authorized when the combatant commander receives official approval from the Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-21 Secretary of Defense. Upon completion of the joint operation, the combatant commander requests termination of free mail via MPSA. Refer to DODI 4525.09 for more information regarding free mail. HOST-NATION POSTAL SUPPORT 4-86. If an agreement is made by the ASCC, combatant command, and the host-nation via Memorandum of Agreement and Status of Forces Agreement, this support can be a critical element of the postal support structure. It frees military and civilian postal personnel for more critical duties. Host-nation personnel can be military or civilian, and they can handle all mail classes except official registered mail. Postal unit commanders must indoctrinate Soldiers supervising host-nation personnel in the customs, language, religion, and political conditions of the AO. INTERNATIONAL MAIL 4-87. The ASCC G-1/AG and the combatant command assess the need for international mail exchange within the theater of operation, and in-conjunction with the TPOC POD and HROB, identify the postal platoon to conduct this mission. All requests for prograde mail support for multinational forces are submitted by the ASCC to the combatant command for submission to the DA Postal and MPSA for approval. Additional security measures should be implemented to safeguard against hazardous materials entering the MPS. OFFICIAL MAIL AND DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT 4-88. The Army G-1 is the functional proponent for the Official Mail and Distribution Management Program and serves as the senior Army policy official for Army-wide official mail. Official mail is mail addressed to or originating from military or other governmental organizations. Official mail is moved through the MPS until it reaches the postal platoon of the unit addressed. Official mail is delivered from the postal platoon to the unit mail clerk/unit mail orderly who then delivers it to the addressee or agent through unit mail distribution channels, the J-1. Refer to AR 25-51, Official Mail and Distribution Management, for procedures regarding official mail. PERSONAL MAIL 4-89. Personal mail is mail addressed to individual Soldiers and civilians. Postal platoons receive, sort, and dispatch personal mail to appointed unit mail clerks. Personal mail is picked up daily by unit mail clerks or as directed by unit commanders IAW METT-TC. Unit mail clerks coordinate with the servicing postal platoon on unit and personnel status changes for mail delivery.POSTAL FINANCE SERVICES 4-90. Postal platoons provide customer service for postal finance support consistent with the commander's mail policies. These services include money order and postage stamp sales, special services, and package mailing. Postal platoons may provide Service members and other authorized personnel finance services within battalion and brigade support areas, when coordinated with supporting HR (postal) companies. Services are provided as often as the tactical situation and manning level allows at outlying locations, and can be increased or decreased based on command directives and METT-TC. Electronic postal finance terminal operations require commercial internet service for USPS updates to the system. Manual methods would have to be used without this capability. 4-91. Units coordinate with the postal platoon leader to provide limited mobile postal finance services to units or teams not located near the main servicing postal platoon. The MTF commander coordinates with the postal platoon in their location to provide necessary postal finance services to customers. Policy for mobile postal missions is directed by the TPOC SOPs. REDIRECT SERVICE 4-92. The postal network provides personal, official, and accountable mail redirect services starting at the unit mail clerk level. There are two forms of redirect services: Soldier redirect and unit redirect. Soldier redirect applies to individual pieces of mail requiring directory service before processing. This includes mail Chapter 4 4-22 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 for individual Soldiers who changed units or locations or were separated from the unit. The unit redirect function involves redirecting bags, trays, or pallets of mail because of task organization changes, unit relocation, or unit redeployment. 4-93. Redirect services depend on the AO postal policy and the tactical situation. All postal platoons provide redirect services. A designated postal platoon(s) provides ASCC-level redirect services. Corps-level postal platoon(s) provides the primary redirect services for the corps. Postal platoons handle redirect of unit mail within their supported AO. The TPOC POD and ESC HROB provide personnel and unit assignment and location information in automated form via local theater unit locator services, DTAS, and the Postal Directory and Addressing System to all postal platoons. USE OF CONTRACTORS FOR POSTAL SUPPORT 4-94. Operational contract support is the process of planning for and obtaining supplies, services, and construction from commercial sources in support combatant commander-directed operations (JP 4-10). During military operations, it may become necessary to contract out selected postal services. Contracting postal support is usually an optimum option when there are insufficient numbers of postal platoons to maintain rotation policies, or when the theater of operations is so vast that the military Services cannot support the area. Oversight of all contractual postal statements of work must be completed annually (or more often, as needed) by the ASCC G-1/AG and the TPOC POD. 4-95. The success of contracting postal operations when shifting from a military operated and military supervised postal operation to a contractor operated postal operation is ensuring the government maintains oversight of the service and ensuring the tactical situation supports the approach. The military accomplishes this by ensuring trained and experienced postal personnel serve as the primary and alternate contracting officer’s representative (COR). A contracting officer’s representative is an individual designated in writing by the contracting officer to perform specific technical or administrative functions (JP 4-10). Although CORs can be employed on all types of service contracts, they are critically important in the more complex services, for example in the MMT. In no case, shall contractor personnel serve as CORs. Not everyone can be a COR; they must be a government employee (either military or civilian) and possess the necessary qualifications (training) and experience commensurate with the responsibilities delegated to them. 4-96. When contractors are used to perform postal missions, a qualified, knowledgeable, postal technical supervisor must be onsite IAW USPS Publication 38, DODI 4525.09, and DFARS PGI Part 201.602-2. Consider the following recommendations when contracting postal operations:  Establish postal OCS teams to serve as the nexus for contracted postal efforts. The teams manage the COR training and appointment program and consolidated Performance Evaluation Board reports. The OCS team prepares monthly roll-up briefings to the contracting officer and for the Award Fee Evaluation Board.  Capability to work with contract managers and legal support offices regarding requirements letters, administrative change letters, and other contract management tools.  Schedule periodical meetings with the contracting officer and contractors to discuss postal issues.  Plan contractor support carefully. It is imperative to identify alignment of property early in the process to ensure it is operational and meets the standard before a transfer of authority. Ensure contract specifies what government furnished equipment will be provided. Define the exact equipment, by location, to be turned over to the contractor during the transfer of authority process.  Understand the differences between government furnished equipment, theater provided equipment, and installation provided equipment.  Include the G-1/AG and the assistant chief of staff, finance and comptroller as required. If there is a requirement for contracting postal support, the assistant chief of staff, finance and comptroller should be a part of the planning and resourcing to provide the proper funding (if available) for this requirement.  Schedule COR training as necessary to meet rotation requirements. Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-23 SECTION III – ARMY BAND OPERATIONS 4-97. Army bands provide support to the force by tailoring music support through military operations. Music instills in Soldiers the will to fight and win, fosters the support of our citizens, and promotes America’s interests at home and abroad. Music serves as a useful tool to reinforce relations with host-nation populations and favorably shapes the civil situation throughout the peace building process. Inherently capable of providing a climate for international relations, Army bands serve as ambassadors in multinational operations or to the host-nation population. 4-98. Army bands provide support across the range of military operations. Military engagement, security cooperation, and deterrence activities build networks and relationships with partners, shape regions, and keep day-to-day tensions between nations and groups below the threshold of armed conflict. As tensions escalate, Army bands stand ready to support the Army’s mission in LSCO. 4-99. Army bands primary functions directly support LSCO by providing support to Soldiers in deployed and austere environments. They are at the forefront of Soldier and leader engagement activities, actively engaging with and communicating important information to local and regional audiences. Army bands are designed, equipped, and trained for three primary functions:  Engaging local, regional, national, and international audiences through world-class musical performances.  Rendering honors and providing musical support to military ceremonies.  Providing live music to Soldiers in deployed and austere environments and to families and veterans on the home front. 4-100. Army bands mission categories describe the function for which Army bands are designed, equipped, and trained to support. All missions fall into one or more of the following categories:  Funeral honors: Missions which honor the service of fallen Soldiers including funeral honors and support for memorial services, memorial ceremonies, and dignified transfer (ramp) ceremonies.  Reviews: Missions conducted within the framework of a ceremony or review, used to honor or recognize unit achievements, present decorations and awards, or mark command transitions IAW TC 3-21.5, Drill and Ceremonies.  Morale and welfare: Missions supporting the physical and social dimensions of comprehensive Soldier and Family fitness, strengthen unit morale, and promote esprit de corps.  Cultural and historical traditions: Missions supporting command recognition of cultural or historical observances.  Community engagement: Missions that are open to the public and intended to generate interest in the Armed Forces, stimulate patriotism, celebrate national holidays, engage with the local public, or enhance relations with local nationals and allies.  Media: Missions intended for broadcast on television or radio and products developed for physical distribution (recordings) or for social media.  Official entertaining: Missions performed exclusively for high-ranking officers, government officials, dignitaries, ambassadors, or embassies. These events are usually by invitation only.  Education outreach: Missions performed to support schools and music education programs.  Recruiting: Missions to support the U.S. Army Recruiting Command’s mission, with or without recruiter presence. 4-101. The type of missions Army bands perform depends upon the supported command’s phase of operations, the location of music performance teams, or the concurrent mission capabilities of the teams. The team focus of Army bands allows them to employ independently or collectively. 4-102. The ASCC G-1/AG, in coordination with subordinate G-1/AGs and G-3s, determines which of the senior commander’s overarching objectives for the AO are appropriate for band support. Operational oversight of the band often comes through the G-3 to achieve G-3 desired effects. The capabilities required to achieve those effects determine the number of bands needed in theater. The ASCC G-1/AG may establish an Army Band Liaison Officer (42C) to synchronize and integrate musical support for Soldiers, HQ, and Chapter 4 4-24 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 diplomatic organizations for ceremonial, protocol, strategic outreach, entertainment, and multinational events. 4-103. The band commander (42C or 420C) is the senior staff advisor to the G-1/AG on band operations. Scheduling band support is completed by the G-1/AG through the G-3 in coordination with the band commander. For command and control purposes, Army bands are attached to the headquarters and headquarters battalion/TSC STB at theater, corps, or division-level for administrative and life support purposes. Refer to ATP 1-19 for specific duties and responsibilities of Army bands. SECTION IV – MORALE, WELFARE, AND RECREATION OPERATIONS 4-104. Morale, welfare, and recreation programs are activities supporting and improving the morale and well-being of the deployed force. These include activities sponsored by the IMCOM G-9 Family and MWR Programs Division, other agencies, and commands at all levels. The terminology used in this publication is not synonymous with official family and MWR programs sponsored by the Army, but may include such programs. 4-105. Morale, welfare, and recreation support is mission essential to combat readiness. Morale, welfare, and recreation programs enhance the quality of life for deployed Soldiers, DOD and DA Civilians, and CAAF forces and address the strategic imperatives of the joint expeditionary Army. 4-106. Commanders at all levels are responsible for ensuring MWR support programs are available. They are responsible for determining different levels of required support based on the mission, anticipated duration of deployment, theater environmental conditions, and higher command requirements. Morale, welfare, and recreation support is METT-TC driven, and commanders must be able to revise plans, programming, and support levels quickly to adapt to changing situations and requirements. Support programs may include activities such as––  Sports activities.  Libraries.  Clubs.  Entertainment.  Army and Air Force Exchange System support.  Fitness and recreation.  American Red Cross support.  Internet facilities.  Health and comfort packs.  Other activities that support the well-being of the deployed force. 4-107. Morale, welfare, and recreation support includes a wide variety of services. Only minimum MWR services are provided during the initial deployment and early sustainment phase of military operations. Minimum services include brigade sports equipment, health and comfort packs, ARC, and limited AAFES. 4-108. The combatant commander, through the J-1/G-1 and J-4/G-4, determines MWR needs and requirements based on operational tempo and available MWR resources. While the J-1/G-1 is the primary staff office responsible for MWR, the J-4/G-4 is responsible for the execution of MWR logistics support requirements. Depending on AO stability and actions, the commander may use alternative sources such as the Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program or other contracted personnel. 4-109. The availability of personnel and facilities provided by the MWR network depends on the combatant commander’s command policies and the operational and tactical situation. Planners at all levels ensure operational plans include requirements for fitness and recreation, AAFES support, and community support functions such as ARC. 4-110. The G-1/AG and S-1 staffs at battalion-level and above must know the full range of MWR services and programs and incorporate them into OPLANS and OPORDs. They must also be knowledgeable of key staff players who support the execution of MWR programs. For example, the battalion or brigade S-4 is responsible for coordination and execution of logistics support for MWR services and programs. These Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-25 services are in the form of unit recreation, library book kits, sports programs, and rest areas at brigade and higher. The MWR network also provides facilities such as recreation centers, internet cafés, and activity centers for deployed personnel that house several MWR functions. 4-111. Civilian recreation staff is available to assist in the planning and execution of necessary support services. Commanders identify appropriate civilian positions on the mobilization table of distribution and allowances in preparation of deployment into the theater of operations to support recreation requirements. When this method of staffing is used, add civilian MWR personnel to the battle-roster of brigade and larger-sized units’ staffs. These personnel normally become members of the G-1/AG and S-1 staffs, and they plan and coordinate MWR activities before and during mobilization. These personnel may also deploy with the unit to accomplish brigade and higher staff MWR responsibilities and assist the unit athletic and recreation officer or NCO (military personnel) in planning and executing MWR programs. 4-112. The IMCOM HQ maintains a roster of MWR emergency essential civilian (EEC) personnel who are available to augment the G-1/AG and S-1 in coordinating and conducting MWR support activities. Upon deployment, MWR EEC specialists are paid with contingency funds. Both appropriated fund and non-appropriated fund MWR personnel may be used, but non-appropriated fund salaries of deployed personnel are reimbursed to the appropriate non-appropriated fund account with contingency funds IAW DOD MWR Utilization, Support and Accountability rules. 4-113. Special duty manpower from ASCC assets and contingent hires may also be used to assist in program execution and facility operation. The Army G-3 may also provide civilian fitness and recreation staff from other installations through the Worldwide Individual Augmentation System tasking authority to IMCOM. Commanders need to establish and validate requirements on their mobilization table of distribution and allowances for MWR EEC positions. 4-114. Unit commanders are responsible for procurement of unit-level recreation kits. These kits are designed to be packaged and distributed to each company size unit for all components. Recreation kits are part of a unit’s table of organization and equipment and deploys with the unit as a portable means to fulfill recreation and leisure needs. They are part of the unit basic load and commanders must include shipment with the higher HQ lift plan and account for them as they would any other table of organization and equipment. 4-115. Commanders at all levels must be sensitive to conditions external to the AO that can affect morale. In emergency cases, ARC representatives inside and outside the JOA can support communications between Soldiers, DOD and DA Civilians, and their families. Under less compelling conditions, commanders may use other means (for example, commanders may send messages through official channels such as the Military Auxiliary Radio System, facsimile transceiver, commercial telephone, or the Army mail system).See AR 215-1, Military Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Programs and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, for further information regarding MWR programs. ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES 4-116. Commanders at all levels are responsible for the MWR support provided to their Soldiers and DOD and DA Civilians. Morale, welfare, and recreation programs are at all echelons on the battlefield and in all operational scenarios. Base requirements on the combat environment and availability of resources. Battalions and below self-administer their programs using their command appointed unit athletic and recreation officers or NCOs; brigades and above assist all subordinate units in planning and executing their MWR programs. Table 4-2 on page 4-26, along with the following paragraphs, addresses the relationship between key players and other staff elements in providing MWR support.

The IMCOM G-9 Family and MWR Programs division assists sustaining base commanders by maintaining MWR (includes Child, Youth, and School Services) and family assistance and readiness support at home stations. The division is the executive agent to provide necessary deployment support to the ARC; AAFES is responsible for exchange support. Activities are based on the needs of the community served. They are available to military personnel and their families and usually to DOD and DA Civilians and their families. 4-118. During military operations, installation staff must be cognizant of population fluctuations and be prepared to provide expanded services. The requirement for service for the families of deployed Soldiers (Regular Army and RC) and the families of those back filling the installation may quickly stress MWR and family programs. 4-119. Prior to and during deployment, the installation Directorate of Human Resources and Family and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation are responsible to––  Assist G-1/AGs and S-1s in procurement and transportation of MWR equipment and supplies included in operations and lift plans.  Train athletic and recreation officers or NCOs in MWR procedures and functions.  Ensure the execution of MWR services is available during initial deployment.

CORPS G-1/AG AND DIVISION G-1 4-121. The corps G-1/AG and division G-1 coordinates, develops, and manages MWR programs IAW ASCC guidance. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific MWR responsibilities of the corps G-1/AG and division G-1. BRIGADE S-1 4-122. The brigade S-1 staff facilitates and coordinates MWR programs. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific MWR responsibilities of the brigade S-1. BATTALION S-1 4-123. The battalion S-1 appoints athletic and recreation officers or NCOs to coordinate MWR programs and maintain equipment. Refer to ATP 1-0.1 for specific MWR responsibilities of the battalion S-1. AMERICAN RED CROSS 4-124. The ARC consistently delivers essential Red Cross services to all Army components, civilians, and their families worldwide to assist them in preventing, preparing for, and coping with emergencies. The ARC provides services such as emergency communication (for example, deaths and births, emergency financial assistance, counseling, and comfort kits in the deployed environment). 4-125. Submit all requests for ARC personnel to accompany U.S. Forces into the JOA to the IMCOM G-9 Family and MWR Programs Division, the DOD executive agent for the deployment of ARC personnel during these situations. The division is responsible for coordinating and securing support for ARC personnel to support military operations, managing and monitoring military support to the ARC, funding travel to and from the AO for ARC personnel, and coordinating and preparing ARC personnel for deployment and return. The ARC National HQ is responsible for supplying the staff and managing and monitoring ARC operations in the field. 4-126. A designated ARC representative is involved with the IMCOM G-9 Family and MWR Programs division, the appropriate military command, and the ARC National HQ in contingency planning to ensure proper coordination and clarification of requirements. In the JOA, coordination for ARC support (logistical and life support) falls under the ASCC G-1/AG. American Red Cross representatives are available at division and higher levels to assist with family emergencies and emergency communication between family members and deployed personnel. See AR 930-5, American National Red Cross Service Program and Army Utilization, for more information regarding the ARC. ARMY AND AIR FORCE EXCHANGE SERVICE 4-127. An AAFES Board of Directors directs AAFES operations worldwide. The system supports major installations in CONUS, outside the CONUS, and units deployed to remote areas. It also supports field operations and exercises. The Army provides afloat pre-positioning force support in the form of materiel, facilities, transportation, field site support, military air and logistical support of AAFES operations. Logistical support of AAFES operations and personnel is provided by direct support or through the Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program. 4-128. During operations, the ASCC commander, in coordination with AAFES, plans for and supports exchange operations. These plans may include a combination of direct operations exchange—tactical operations, tactical field exchanges, and/or AAFES Imprest Fund Activities. 4-129. The AAFES deploys personnel to assist the Army in establishing direct retail operations and an exchange warehousing and distribution system. The ASCC and corps G-1/AGs coordinate with their G-4s in the process of designating, training, deploying, and employing Army and Air Force personnel to support the Provide Human Resources Services 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 4-29 AO AAFES system. The AAFES may establish these activities using employees, which consist of U.S.
nationals, contract operators, host-nation employees, third country national employees, or vendors. 4-130. Military personnel normally operate tactical field exchanges, and AAFES personnel operate direct operations exchange-tactical operations. Tactical field exchanges provide merchandise and services on a temporary basis in areas where permanent exchange activities are not present. Tactical field exchanges and direct operations exchange-tactical operations serves Soldiers and civilians, and may locate as far forward as the brigade support area provided the tactical situation allows. 4-131. The AAFES Imprest Fund Activity is a military-operated retail activity, usually operated in small or remote sites, when regular direct operation exchanges cannot be provided. Should commanders choose to employ these activities, they must select and train personnel from their units to operate them. The unit is issued an initial fund by AAFES to purchase a beginning inventory. Use money generated from sales to replenish the merchandise stock. A site commander can request the establishment of an AAFES Imprest Fund Activity from the general manager of the AAFES geographical area. See AR 215-8, Army and Air Force Exchange Service Operations, for more information on AAFES operations. BATTLEFIELD FLOW 4-132. For planning purposes, the following guidelines establish a time-phased schedule for deploying MWR resources to support military operations. Actual timelines and operations depend on METT-TC. 4-133. During the first 30 days of operations, MWR may be limited to unit-level recreation kits and health and comfort packs as part of the unit’s basic load. The following actions take place during this period:  Commanders obtain book kits provided by the home installation library.  Athletic and recreation officers or NCOs procure unit-level recreation kits using mission funding. The installation director of Family and MWR may assist with procurement.  Corps G-1/AGs and division G-1s requisition and distribute MWR service-level kits.  The ASCC and/or corps G-1/AG and division G-1 establish a network for distributing and rotating AAFES-provided films and videotapes.  The AAFES begins transporting exchange items and coordinates with the theater and corps for transportation, storage, and distribution support.  The Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support sends additional health and comfort packs to arrive within 30 days.  Civilian MWR EEC personnel deploy to the AO as early as the situation permits and as requested by the ASCC commander. If conditions do not permit or the commander does not request deployment of civilians, military staffs must be prepared to establish and maintain MWR support. Coordination for supplemental civilian MWR EEC personnel is through the IMCOM HQ. 4-134. The following actions take place from 30-60 days of operations:  Coordinate with the G-4 and base camp commanders for the deployment of MWR service-level kits, electronic game kits, theater in a box kits, video messenger kit, and any other available kits. These kits contain fragile, bulky, and heavy items such as televisions, videocassette recorders, digital videodisk players, basketball goals, and free weights.  Provide appropriate personnel assets to operate MWR programs.  Develop policies for rest area use.  Coordinate with the G-4 for distributing health and comfort packs with Class I supplies to units and individuals lacking access to exchange or host-nation retail facilities.  Coordinate with the G-4 and AAFES for establishment of a base of operations and distribution center capable of supporting direct operations exchange—tactical operations, tactical field exchanges, and/or AAFES Imprest Fund Activities.  Coordinate with the G-4 for designating, training, deploying, and employing Army personnel to support the mission. Chapter 4 4-30 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Coordinate with the IMCOM G-9 Family and MWR Programs division to implement a system for distribution of deployed unit funds and book kits to units within and every 30 days thereafter. Coordination for supplemental MWR EEC personnel is through IMCOM HQ. 4-135.The following actions take place from 60-120 days of operations:  The G-4 establishes theater-level DOD activity address codes for MWR. Supply channels stock MWR items on their common table of allowances. Morale, welfare, and recreation supplies and equipment are ordered and shipped to an ASCC MWR DOD activity address code. Examples are weights, amusement machines, lounge and entertainment equipment, and other items for unit recreation and rest area operations.  Corps and division base of operations expands to provide one or more support package (force provider). Develop rest areas to meet the needs of a brigade-size unit. Base actual timelines and operations on METT-TC. This package provides recreational activities, AAFES retail outlets, vendors, and personnel services support such as postal, legal, unit ministry, and ARC services. Other services available are billeting, laundry, latrine, shower, food, and medical. The support package's primary mission is to provide R&R facilities for deployed personnel who have suffered stress associated with combat duties. The location of this support package is in the corps and division areas.  The ASCC G-1/AG may establish a pass program or ASCC rest area within the AO. Request assistance from the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management and the IMCOM G-9 Family and MWR Programs division.  The ASCC and subordinate commands develop and implement R&R policies. Live entertainment, including Army Entertainment productions and Armed Forces Entertainment shows (for example, the United Service Organization), is requested based on availability, ASCC policy, and the tactical situation.  During redeployment, operations consolidate or close as the number of personnel supported decreases. Commanders ensure adequate support for residual forces. The ASCC and corps staffs establish and implement policies for equipment turn-in and redeployment. Resource accountability is critical during this phase to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.  Rest and recuperation centers request disposition of equipment and supplies from the IMCOM G-9 Family and MWR Programs division. 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 5-1 Chapter 5 Coordinate Personnel Support Chapter 5 provides an overview of personnel support functions for command interest programs and retention operations. These personnel support functions require coordination and generally fall under the responsibility of G-1/AGs and S-1s. SECTION I – COMMAND INTEREST PROGRAMS 5-1. Command interest programs are of general interest to organizations and Soldiers. The following paragraphs briefly discuss the general responsibilities of the S-1 with respect to any command interest program demanding specific attention as directed by the commander. Some programs that traditionally fall within the purview are provided as examples to understand the principles of support involved but should not be considered all-inclusive. Command interest programs generally have five key components that include the responsible agent or agency, regulatory or statutory guidance, checklist, compliance protocols, and reporting requirements. 5-2. A responsible agent or agency is someone specific or a subordinate element that is appointed, in writing, by order or policy memorandum, that establishes the scope and responsibilities of the duty to be performed, the length of time the duty is performed and any applicable references authorizing the order. The commander or his/her designated representative must sign any order or policy memorandum establishing a responsible agent or agency for a command interest program. The S-1 ensures the order is completed and maintained IAW the requirements for the program. 5-3. All command interest programs must follow regulatory guidance or statutory requirements for successful execution of the program. The S-1 can assist to ensure the responsible agent has access to the current regulations or policies governing the program. For example, AR 600-20, Army Command Policy, establishes the Army Equal Opportunity Program. For the commander, it highlights all the essential elements of the program to ensure equal opportunity and fair treatment to all Soldiers and their family members. 5-4. Most programs have specific requirements or procedures to follow. A checklist ensures completion of each component is on time and in the proper order. At any time, the checklist can be updated to reflect procedure changes. In some cases, the S-1 may not perform some or any of the duties on the checklist beyond assuring that a responsible agent is appointed. For example, the Army Voting Assistance Program educates eligible Soldiers on the importance of voting and provides every opportunity to register and cast their votes. However, the program manager may not necessarily be in the S-1. Any Soldier meeting the requirements outlined in AR 608-20, Army Voting Assistance Program, may be appointed as the voting assistance officer. That individual, once appointed in writing, is responsible for following the checklist, maintaining compliance with the regulation, and reporting periodically to the commander the status of the program. 5-5. Compliance protocols are the methods and procedures to provide quality assurance as mandated by law for any federal agency. Simply put, these are the inspections performed by higher HQ, inspector general, or other agency to measure, through appropriate metrics, the command’s compliance with the requirements established by the regulation or law. Most often, these are performed when a principal responsible agent changes, the governing guidance changes, or annually if no other circumstance has prompted a review. The S-1 tracks the timeline for inspections; coordinates or schedules, where appropriate, the inspection and any follow up actions, and maintains any historical inspections as required. 5-6. Each command interest program’s governing regulation or implementing guidance usually provides the time and manner by which progress reports are submitted to the commander, higher HQ, or external agencies. The S-1 may act as the staff command principal for consolidating, formatting, and presenting the Chapter 5 5-2 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 required information to the commander. This is especially true for programs that require the commander’s signature for certification or authentication. SECTION II – RETENTION OPERATIONS 5-7. The Army Retention Program plays a continuous role during military operations. This program ensures all Soldiers, regardless of the operation, have access to career counseling and retention processing. Army career counseling is the fundamental element of the Army Retention Program, which provides commanders the internal command climate knowledge needed to adjust their individual retention programs to ensure they meet the needs of Soldiers and families without jeopardizing the manning requirements necessary to provide for the defense of the Nation. Army retention affects unit strength. 5-8. Commanders are the retention officers for their respective commands and command sergeant majors are the senior retention NCOs for their units. To be truly effective, the Army Retention Program requires enthusiastic command involvement and dedicated expert advice to retain high quality Soldiers. Retaining quality Soldiers certified in competence, character, and commitment ensures the stability of the Army’s future force. 5-9. While unit commanders and leaders are ultimately responsible for retaining Soldiers at their level, career counselors located at battalion and above organizations are technical experts charged with advising commanders on all aspects of the Army Retention Program. Career counselors, due to their advisory role to the commander, are on his/her special staff. They also determine retention eligibility, retention options, and assist with eligibility for special commissioning programs consistent with published regulations and DA directives. See AR 601-280 for specific information on the Army Retention Program. CAREER COUNSELOR’S ROLE IN PREPARATION FOR DEPLOYMENT 5-10. The Army Retention Program is the long-term answer for maintaining end strength. At the center of this program is the career counselor. Retention operations are functions conducted at home station and during military operations. While career counselors are not table of organization and equipment assets in most organizations, they play an important role not only during pre-deployment, but during deployment as well. Unit leaders need to ensure career counselors are included as part of the deployment force and included in operational orders and contingency plans. Retention operations should be included in unit SOPs. 5-11. At home stations, career counselors accomplish unit specific retention missions consistent with goals of the Army Retention Program. While deployed, career counselors continue to implement the Army Retention Program through reenlistment and other retention initiatives. Stop-movement efforts do not eliminate the requirement for career counselors to deploy. It is only a temporary tool used to maintain Army end strength. 5-12. During deployments, unit commanders need to ensure adequate career counselor support is available to rear detachment or non-deployed personnel. This is accomplished via a memorandum of understanding or agreement between units or with the post retention office. 5-13. When planning for deployment operations, career counselors must conduct the following actions:  Screen all Soldier records not serving on indefinite status to ensure records are entered in the Reenlistment, Reclassification, and Assignment System, and complete a DA Form 4591 (Retention Counseling Record) for all non-indefinite status Soldiers with a current enlisted records brief.  Coordinate with the battalion or brigade S-6 for telephone and network connectivity into required databases and automated systems.  Obtain sufficient office equipment and supplies (for example, laptop computer, appropriate software, scanner, printer, digital sender, U.S. flag, storage containers, necessary forms, and digital camera). Coordinate Personnel Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 5-3 5-14. During pre-deployment processing, career counselors should brief Soldiers on deployment extensions and the stop-movement program, if necessary. Identify and train additional duty reenlistment NCOs for continual retention support, especially for geographically dispersed units. ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES 5-15. Listed in the paragraphs below are unit responsibilities for retention operations. These responsibilities are not all inclusive and should only be used as a guide. ASCC/CORPS/DIVISION 5-16.

The increasingly hi-tech nature of equipment and rapid deployment requirements significantly increase the need to integrate civilian and CAAF personnel support into military operations. Reductions in military structure, coupled with high mission requirements and the unlikely prospect of full mobilization, mean to reach a minimum of required levels of support, deployed military forces often must be significantly augmented with civilian and CAAF personnel. As these trends continue, the future battlefield will require significant numbers of non-uniformed participants. This chapter discusses support provided by DOD and DA Civilians and CAAF. OVERVIEW OF DOD AND DA CIVILIANS AND CAAF SUPPORT 6-1. Numerous examples exist throughout our Nation’s history, from settlers supporting the Continental Army, nurses supporting the Civil War and other wars, to contractors supporting complex weapons and equipment systems. Without support and services the civilian force provides, the military would be unable to accomplish many of its missions. The primary focus of this chapter is to––  Identify the role and responsibilities of HR organizations in providing support to DOD and DA Civilians and CAAF who deploy with the force.  Provide general OCS information to leaders. In some operational scenarios, contracted support is required to supplement PASR, HR support to casualty operations, or postal functions within a theater. 6-2. Army mobilization planners of each functional component, at all organizational levels, plan for DOD and DA Civilians and CAAF who support weapons systems, equipment maintenance, and provide other services. Deliberate planning effectively integrates DOD and DA Civilians and CAAF and includes logistical, administrative, medical, and other support to ensure sufficient theater resources are available in the AO to support them. Planning for civilian and CAAF support must be conducted in the early operational planning stage. 6-3. The following are functional proponents for various categories of civilians who may deploy to support an operation:  The functional proponent for Army personnel support to DOD and DA Civilians (appropriated and non-appropriated employees) is the Army G-1.  The functional proponent for CAAF is the Army G-4. Contracting activities and contracting officers provide contractual oversight for contractors.  The AAFES performs non-appropriated civilian personnel management for AAFES personnel.  The functional proponent for deployed ARC, Army Continuing Education System, and MWR personnel is the IMCOM. The IMCOM G-9 Family and MWR Programs Division executes MWR support. Deployed ARC personnel are special staff under the G-1/AG of the assigned or deployed unit. Army Continuing Education System support is through a functional support team member assigned by the IMCOM Army Continuing Education System. 6-4. Emergency-essential (E-E) personnel. Civilians who deploy with the force are usually coded E-E on authorization documents. Typically, civilians deploy in a TDY status for a period of 179 days. Army Chapter 6 6-2 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 commands or units with deployed civilians remain responsible for replacing them after 179 days. If Army commands are unable to provide a replacement, fill requirements are developed and requested by the ASCC via the Worldwide Individual Augmentation System. All civilians are required to process through a CRC before deployment. The following guidelines apply:  An E-E position is a position overseas or expected to transfer overseas during a crisis, and requires the incumbent to deploy or perform a TDY assignment overseas to support a military operation.  Emergency-essential civilians must be U.S. citizens and not subject to military recall. Family members of forward deployed E-E civilians are evacuated from crisis locations with the same priority and afforded the same services and assistance as family members of military personnel.  A signed E-E statement of understanding is required to ensure civilian personnel are fully aware of the Army's expectations. However, a commander can direct civilians, not designated E-E, to deploy in a TDY status or to remain in an area already on TDY or permanent assignment to perform duties essential to the military mission. 6-5. Department of the Army and DOD civilians generally receive the same level of support as Soldiers and, like Soldiers, the military leadership provides command and control over them. Again, like Soldiers, the HR support mission is to provide HR support to them. While the official database of record for civilians is currently separate from the military, they receive the same level of personnel accountability in DTAS, are included in PERSTATs, provided postal and MWR support, eligible for awards and decorations, and receive evaluation reports. 6-6. Non-governmental personnel include those employed by private organizations, such as ARC personnel, media representatives, visiting dignitaries, representatives of DOD-sponsored organizations such as the United Service Organization, banking facilities, and citizens for whom local State Department officials have requested support. In certain situations, their presence may be command-directed or sponsored, and require the Army to provide limited support. 6-7. Contractors authorized to accompany the force are contractor employees and all tiers of subcontractor employees who are authorized to accompany the force in applicable contingency operations outside of the United States and have afforded such status through the issuance of a letter of authorization (JP 4-10). Contingency contractor employees fall into two primary categories:  CAAF: Contractor employees specifically authorized through their contract to accompany the force and have protected legal status through the issuance of a letter of authorization IAW international conventions. Per these international conventions, CAAF are non-combatants, but are entitled to prisoner of war status if detained. They normally include U.S. citizen expatriates and third-country national employees who are not normal residents in the operational area. However, local national employees may also be afforded CAAF status on an as-needed basis. All eligible CAAF must be issued an identification card with their Geneva Convention CAAF designation and be accounted for in SPOT.  Non-CAAF: Employees of commercial entities in the operational area, but do not accompany the force (for example, they do not live on base or receive life support from the military). Non-CAAF are usually non-mission essential personnel (for example, day laborers, delivery personnel, and cleaning service personnel) who neither reside with U.S. forces nor receive authorized government support such as billeting and subsistence. During international armed conflict, non-CAAF employees are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War but may still be afforded protection status under the Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war. Non-CAAF employees are normally not included in personnel accounting reports. Note. Contractor personnel accounting requirements normally apply to CAAF personnel only. Human resources leaders must ensure they are aware of higher-level command guidance regarding CAAF and non-CAAF accounting procedures. 6-8. The combatant commander is responsible for CAAF replacements. Replacements for CAAF is part of annex W of the OPLAN. Annex W consists of three elements— DOD and DA Civilians and Contractors Authorized to Accompany the Force (CAAF) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 6-3  Summary of Contracting Capabilities and Capacities Support Estimate.  Contractor Management Plan.  Summary of Contractor Support Estimate. 6-9. The combatant commander concepts plan, TPFDD, OPLANs, and the campaign plan must include a separate contractor management plan or requisite contractor management requirements document. The contractor management plan identifies theater-specific contractor management, accountability requirements, key staff, and subordinate command responsibilities. The contractor management plan provides guidance regarding deployment preparation, in-theater management (to include legal jurisdiction and discipline matters), government furnished support and redeployment of CAAF. The plan is applicable to all CAAF to support U.S. forces executing OCS operations in an operational area. 6-10. Operational commanders are responsible for ensuring development of operational contract support plans, support replacement for CAAF who are performing mission essential contractor services in contingency operations to mitigate the loss of services. This task includes assessing alternative sources (military, DOD and DA Civilians, local nationals, or other contractors) or identification of actions that will mitigate the loss of such support. 6-11. The SPOT is the DOD enterprise system that provides authorized users the capability to manage and maintain by-name accountability of CAAF and other designated contractor personnel in an operational area. It provides user access to a web-based application to view, input, and manage contractor personnel pre-deployment, accountability, and location data. All CAAF deploying to support an operation must be entered in the SPOT, and obtain a Letter of Authorization generated from the SPOT database, before deployment. Non-CAAF with a period of performance greater than 30 days will also be included into the SPOT. Contracting officers must review and authorize Letters of Authorization. The contractor is responsible for entering and maintaining the SPOT information. Contracting officers will ensure in the contract that the contractor's performance includes the administrative actions required to keep the SPOT database current. The contracting officer will also indicate government furnished services on Letters of Authorization. See ATP 4-10/MCRP 4-11H/NTTP 4-09.1/AFMAN 10-409-O, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Operational Contract Support for more details on OCS planning. ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES 6-12. The following paragraphs describe unit responsibilities HR support in providing civilian and CAAF support. ASCC G-1/AG 6-13. The ASCC G-1/AG responsibilities include––  Establish theater policies for accountability and support of civilian personnel (DOD and DA Civilians, CAAF, and non-CAAF if applicable).  Include CAAF and other theater designated contractor personnel in PERSTAT submissions.  Ensure CAAF support is included in all OPLANs and OPORDs.  Establish requirements for E-E employees (for example, numbers and skills in the theater of operations).  Establish procedures and coordinate (with the G-3) for DOD and DA Civilian replacements and augmentees.  Coordinate with the TSC and TPOC to identify and resolve CAAF and other theater designated contractor PASR issues. Integrate CAAF and other theater designated contractor personnel into the theater database.  Account for and report the status of all DOD and DA Civilians, to include CAAF, assigned or attached to support LSCO.  Receive and process casualty reports for DOD and DA Civilians and contractors (ASCC HROC theater CIC).  Ensure DOD and DA Civilians, CAAF, and other theater designated contractor personnel receive appropriate HR support (for example, postal, casualty, and MWR). Chapter 6 6-4 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Establish and announce the administrative workweek to ensure E-E employees receive proper payment for all hours worked.  Determine AO specific operation deployability requirements such as medical and physical, clothing and equipment, weapons issue policy for E-E employees and CAAF, deployed personnel tracking and reporting procedures, and theater unique cultural and environmental training. Provide this information to the Army G-1 before deployment of civilians. TPOC 6-14. The TPOC responsibilities include––  Ensure all DOD and DA Civilians, CAAF, and other theater designated contractor personnel are entered in the deployed database (for example, DTAS for DOD and DA Civilians and SPOT for contractors).  Coordinate with subordinate HROB(s) to resolve any PASR, casualty, or postal requirements. ARMY FIELD SUPPORT BRIGADE 6-15. The AFSB contractor personnel responsibilities include––  Receive the CAAF coordination cell as part of theater opening operations to assist in establishing initial contractor accountability in theater. Representatives are normally located at each APOD.  Conduct CAAF reception activities at the APOD to assist in accounting for, receiving, and processing CAAF arriving in and departing from the operational area.  Assist in maintaining visibility, accountability, and tracking of all Army CAAF and other contractors as directed by the ASCC. The AFSB accomplishes this through the attached CAAF coordination cell using SPOT. It maintains contract employee data and reflects the location and status of all contractors based on information entered by the contract company and Joint Asset Movement Management System scans.  Maintain the Joint Asset Movement Management System hardware and software.  Coordinate with the TG PAT or the sustainment brigade HROB supporting the APOD or sea port of debarkation to resolve contractor accountability issues.  Provide SPOT accountability data through the TSC/ESC to the ASCC G-1/AG IAW established timelines. HROB 6-16. The HROB responsibilities include––  Ensure CAAF support and requirements are included in all OPLANs and OPORDs.  Ensure subordinate units maintain visibility and accountability of unit contractors.  Coordinate with the TPOC, HR company, and COR to resolve contractor accountability, postal or casualty issues. HR COMPANY 6-17. The HR company responsibilities include––  Synchronize personnel accounting with the AFSB CAAF coordination cell (if established) at the APOD/sea port of debarkation.  Coordinate with the TPOC POD to identify and resolve E-E CAAF postal issues.  Coordinate with the TPOC personnel accountability and systems division to identify and resolve E-E CAAF personnel accounting and strength reporting issues.  Provide full or limited postal services IAW theater policy to DOD and DA Civilians and CAAF as outlined in the terms and conditions of the contracts. DOD and DA Civilians and Contractors Authorized to Accompany the Force (CAAF) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 6-5 PERSONNEL ACCOUNTING AND STRENGTH REPORTING 6-18. The ASCC G-1/AG has the overall responsibility to collect strength related information on all personnel deploying with the force. This includes Soldiers, DOD and DA Civilians, CAAF (including other theater designated contractor personnel), and non-governmental civilians (for example, ARC and AAFES) who provide support to the deployed force. Without accurate strength and accountability information, it becomes difficult for the combatant commander to synchronize support with the operational Army being supported into the overall operation. Refer to chapter 3, section II of this publication for more information regarding PASR for CAAF. 6-19. For CAAF (including other theater designated contractor personnel), PASR is of crucial concern to the HR community. As the ASCC G-1/AG has responsibility for personnel accounting and reporting strength data to the combatant commander, accurate reporting of contractor strength is necessary in determining and resourcing government support requirements such as facilities, life support, and security requirements in operational environments. 6-20. As stated in AR 715-9, Operational Contract Support Planning and Management, HR is responsible to report CAAF and other designated contractor personnel as found in the SPOT database. Accuracy of this data is the responsibility of the prime contractor, the supporting contracting office, and associate requiring activities. The United States Army Materiel Command, normally through the supporting AFSB, assists in establishing and maintaining accountability of Army CAAF in the AO. During major operations, the AFSB may establish a CAAF coordination cell to assist with PASR of CAAF. They ensure the CAAF are aware of the requirement to maintain their specific theater location by using the SPOT database to accurately reflect their location within theater.The SPOT provides by-name accountability data for all contractors deployed in theater, including pre-deployment certification, contract, and point of contact information, and area of performance. The Army Forces G-1 is responsible to ensure subordinate sustainment command HR staffs are prepared to access applicable SPOT contractor accountability data to be included in standard Army personnel reports. Refer questions regarding SPOT to the G-4 OCS personnel for resolution. HR SUPPORT TO CASUALTY OPERATIONS 6-21. Conduct casualty reporting for deployed DOD and DA Civilians in a similar manner as for Soldiers. This includes proper notification of civilians’ NOK. Submit casualty reports through casualty channels to the CMAOD, then CMAOD contacts emergency point of contacts at their organizations. AR 638-8 lists the categories of civilians for which a casualty report is required. Upon notification of an Army Civilian casualty, a representative from the Army’s Benefits Center contacts the NOK to discuss benefits and entitlements. 6-22. Conduct casualty reporting of CAAF, to include other theater designated contractor personnel, in the same manner as for Soldiers and DOD and DA Civilians (for example, submit casualty reports through casualty channels back to the CMAOD). Upon receipt of reports, CMAOD notifies the contracting company or firm who conducts the NOK notification. POSTAL SUPPORT 6-23. When authorized via Memorandum of Instruction, Status of Forces Agreement, or contractual agreement in written orders, postal services are provided to qualified, deployed DOD and DA Civilians and CAAF personnel in the same manner as for Soldiers, or as spelled out in the guidance as noted. The CAAF personnel may use the ZIP Code of the primary unit they support (for example, the ZIP Code of the HQ of the division or TSC) unless the MPSA designates a separate ZIP Code for them. The postal platoon and the S-1 provide the same support to DOD and DA Civilians and CAAF who move from unit to unit as they would for a Soldier who changes units. Just as a Soldier’s address must be kept current so must a civilian’s address, primarily using a DA Form 3955 (Change of Address and Directory Card). 6-24. The nationality of the contractor employee usually determines postal support. United States citizen CAAF, to support the U.S. Armed Forces, may be authorized to use the MPS if there is no USPS available and if MPS use is not precluded by the terms of any international or host-nation agreement. Local nationals hired in country by DOD, or subcontracted by a DOD contractor, are normally provided with postal support through the existing host-nation system or through arrangements made by the employing contractor. Chapter 6 6-6 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 MORALE, WELFARE, AND RECREATION SUPPORT 6-25. Maintaining acceptable quality of life is important to the overall morale of any organization, including DOD and DA Civilians and contractors. Deployed civilians have access to recreational activities, goods, services, and community support programs such as the ARC, family support and the exchange system. 6-26. Generally, contractors are not entitled to MWR support. However, the military may provide MWR support to contractor employees when contractor resources are not available; subject to the combatant commander’s discretion and the terms of the contract. Morale, welfare, and recreation support is not provided to local nationals. 6-27. The availability of MWR programs in an AO vary with the deployment location. Morale, welfare, and recreation activities available may include self-directed recreation (for example, issue of sports equipment), entertainment in coordination with the United Service Organization and the Armed Forces Professional Entertainment Office, military clubs, unit lounges and some types of rest centers. 6-28. United States citizen CAAF may be eligible to use AAFES, Navy Exchange, or Marine Corps Exchange facilities for health and comfort items. Use of these facilities is based on the combatant commander’s discretion, the terms and conditions of the contract and any applicable Status of Forces Agreement. OTHER HR SUPPORT 6-29. For DOD civilians, the home station and the deployed supervisor ensure deployed DOD civilians receive HR services and support comparable to that received by civilians not deployed. These services may include such areas as DA Civilian awards (for example, performance or monetary awards for special acts, suggestions, or inventions); performance appraisals; supervisory documentation; appointments; career programs; promotions and reductions; identification documents; health insurance and leave. Normally, the deployed supervisor provides input to deployed civilians’ awards and performance appraisals. DEPLOYMENT AND REDEPLOYMENT OF DOD AND DA CIVILIANS AND CAAF 6-30. The Army created several sites within CONUS for expeditiously preparing DOD and DA Civilians and contractors for deployment. These sites, like the CRC, receive and certify theater entrance eligibility and process individuals for deployment. Redeploying individuals normally process back through the same CRC as they initially processed through to ensure recovery of government-issued equipment. When it is not practical or affordable, DOD and DA Civilians and contractors deploying from Hawaii, Alaska, or Europe may not need to process through a CRC, but may process from locations with similar processing capabilities as a CRC. 6-31. For deploying DOD and DA Civilians, each must have a deployment packet prepared and provided by the individual’s home station/installation civilian personnel office or employer. A copy of the deployment packet should be hand carried to the CRC. The CRC validates the completion of deployment requirements and provides the individual with a copy to take to the personnel support activity in the AO. The deployment packet serves as a field file. It consists of a personnel data sheet from the civilian personnel office, DA Form 7425, medical documents, copy of the DD Form 93, clothing and organizational equipment record, AO clearance, and other requirements listed on the DA Form 7425. 6-32. For CAAF, DOD policy requires SPOT generated Letters of Authorization by a warranted contracting officer authorizing CAAF deployment center processing, travel to and from the AOR, and what government furnished support (for example, military air, MWR, and postal) they will receive during the performance of the contract. Upon receiving the contracted company’s certification stating that CAAF meet deployability requirements, the contracting officer or representative digitally signs the Letter of Authorization that is presented to officials at the CRC, mobilization station, or AO point of entry. The CAAF are required by policy to maintain a copy of their Letter of Authorization in their possession. DOD and DA Civilians and Contractors Authorized to Accompany the Force (CAAF) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 6-7 6-33. An individual readiness file must be completed for all deploying CAAF as part of deployment processing at the CRC, mobilization station, or AO point of entry. The file must always be in the possession of the employee while in theater or must be readily available at the area of performance. Minimum requirements for the individual readiness file includes–verifying personnel accountability information in SPOT; issuance of ID tags and ID card with the Geneva Conventions Accompanying the Force designation; valid passport or visa if required; issuance of applicable government-furnished equipment, conducting theater specific briefings and training, and verifying medical and dental screening, including required military specific vaccinations and immunizations. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure its employees receive all required processing information. 6-34. For various reasons, some system and external support contractors may inadvertently deploy without processing through either an authorized contractor deployment site or CRC. When this occurs, the contract employee normally returns to their point of origin at company expense. The CAAF coordination cell, in the AO, conducts pre-deployment processing as soon as possible during the reception processing. 6-35. Upon completion of an operation, contractors redeploy out of the AO as quickly as METT-TC allows. The timing of the departure of contractor support operations is as critical as it is for military forces. Orderly withdrawal or termination of contractor operations ensures essential contractor support remains until no longer needed and movement of contractor equipment and employees does not inadvertently hinder the overall redeployment process. Essentially, contractor personnel should undergo the same redeployment process as military personnel. However, planners must determine the specific steps desired and know the cost associated with doing so. 6-36. Redeployment processes are essentially the same functions as those involved in deployment. The procedures are similar, whether contractors are redeploying to their point of origin (home station) or to another AO. Contractors normally redeploy the same way they deployed (either under government control or self-deploy). 6-37. Prior to arriving at aerial ports and/or seaports of embarkation, contractors accomplish the same preparations as military forces. Similar to deployment, contractor accountability requirements continue, enabling the military to maintain accountability of and manage contractors as they proceed through the redeployment process. 6-38. The CRC or individual deployment site is responsible for assisting the return of individual civilian and contractor employees to their organization or to their home. Contractor employees who deploy with their habitually supported unit normally redeploy with that unit. CONTRACTING HR SUPPORT FUNCTIONS 6-39. During contingency military operations, HR leaders continually assess the capability of HR units to provide or maintain adequate support within their AO. During these assessments, HR leaders, in some cases, determine the same level of support cannot be sustained without additional resources. Additional resources include manpower, equipment and supplies. This shortfall may be caused by an insufficient number of HR units to support theater rotation policies or when the theater of operations is so vast that current HR organizations cannot provide adequate area support. 6-40. One method to overcome a shortfall in manning, equipment or supplies is for HR leaders to consider OCS to provide needed supplies, equipment, and in limited cases, HR-related services. This is not a new idea, but one that has been successful in various operational scenarios (for example, mail is moved by contractors to and from the MMT). Contractors also perform selected functions within APOs. While contracting out HR functions may not be the preferred method, it is an option for consideration by HR leaders. In all cases, OCS requires detailed planning and proper government oversight. 6-41. The requiring unit or activity and the supported commander and staff develop a risk assessment to evaluate the value and feasibility of contracting support for any given military operation. This assessment evaluates the impact of contractor support on mission accomplishment, including the impact on military forces, if they are required to provide security, lodging, mess, or any other support to contractors. This assessment determines if the value the contractor brings to operations is worth the risk and resources required to ensure its performance. Chapter 6 6-8 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 6-42. While the availability of funds is a significant determinate in contracting feasibility, HR leaders must understand the contracting process and the roles they may have in this process. Human resources professionals may act as requiring activity planners or as CORs. As such, it is crucial for HR professionals to become familiar with OCS terms, procedures, roles and responsibilities they have in the process, and should consider attending the contracting officer representative course as a priority before deployment. Human resources leaders must ensure contracts include requirements for the protection of personally identifiable information IAW all applicable policies and regulations. 6-43. Operational contract support is a key capability for deployed Armed Forces. Due to the importance and unique challenges of OCS, HR leaders need to understand their role in planning for and managing contracted support. Current doctrine describes three broad types of contracted support: theater, external, and systems support.  Theater support contracts: Supports deployed operational forces under pre-arranged contracts, or contracts awarded from the mission area, by contracting officers under the command and control of the supporting contracting support brigade or designated joint theater support contracting command. Theater support contractors acquire goods, services, and minor construction support, usually from local commercial sources, to meet the immediate needs of operational commanders. Theater support contracts are typically associated with contingency contracting. Human resources professionals may serve as requiring activity planners for theater support OCS actions. Execute theater support contracts to support HR missions through a general support manner via a contracting support brigade contingency contract team or the joint theater support contracting command regional contracting office.  External support contracts: Provides a variety of support to deployed forces. External support contracts may be pre-arranged contracts or contracts awarded during the contingency itself to support the mission and may include a mix of U.S. citizens, third-country nationals, and local national subcontractor employees. The largest and most commonly used external support contract is the Army’s Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program contract. This Army program is commonly used to provide many sustainment related services to include HR support (for example, mail movement and MWR).  System support contracts: Pre-arranged contracts used by the acquisition program office and generally not related to HR operations. 6-44. Human resources leaders and staff officers must ensure all HR related theater support and Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program support actions are planned for and incorporated into the overall HR effort in the AO. It is imperative that HR professionals work closely with the supporting Contracting Support Brigade and/or Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program-Forward personnel during both the planning process and the post-award process. It is also imperative that HR professionals receive training on their role in the OCS planning and execution process as described in the next two paragraphs. 6-45. Regarding OCS requirements development, HR professionals must be prepared to develop an acquisition ready requirement packet to submit to the supporting contracting activity. The packet must include a detailed performance work statement (sometimes referred to as a statement of work) for service requirements or a detailed item description/capability for a commodity requirement. In addition to the performance work statement, the packet must include an independent cost estimate of the item or service required along with a required command and staff (including resource management) approved DA Form 3953 (Purchase Request and Commitment). Additionally, certain items or specific dollar amount requests may require a formal acquisition review board packet as directed by local command policies. 6-46. Human resources professionals also play a key role in the post-award contract management for all theater support contracts and Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program task orders directly supporting the HR mission. One of the most important sustainment brigade tasks in this process is to nominate and track CORs for service contracts and receiving officials for all commodity contracts. Quality CORs and receiving official support are key to ensuring contractors provide the service or item IAW the contract. Human resources leaders must also manage funding for each HR related contract and request funds in advance of depletion of current funds; otherwise, all contract work ceases until adequate funds are available. Human resources receiving officials and CORs are responsible for completing receiving reports that certify the goods or services contracted for were received by the Army. DOD and DA Civilians and Contractors Authorized to Accompany the Force (CAAF) Support 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 6-9 6-47. In addition to the basic OCS requirements development and post-contract award actions described above, there are many specific OCS planning and management tasks that HR leaders and staff officers should be familiar with when contemplating requesting contract support. The following should be considered when planning to contract out HR or postal operations:  Establish specific OCS coordination personnel or teams to serve as the nexus for the planning and integration effort. For example, establish an OCS postal support team for planning and integrating contracted postal functions. These teams manage the COR program and consolidate Performance Evaluation Board reports. The OCS postal support team may also need to prepare monthly roll-up briefings to the supporting contracting support brigade contracting officer and for the Award Fee Evaluation Board.  Human resource OCS teams should have the capability and ability to work with supporting contracting officers, contract managers, and logistics support officers regarding requirements letters, administrative change letters, and other contract management tools.  Routinely meet with the supporting contracting support brigade contracting officer to discuss contractor tasks issues. Conduct meetings at least bi-weekly.  Plan OCS carefully. It is imperative to identify how to align property or equipment early in the process to ensure it is operational and meets the standard before a transfer of authority. Ensure contracts specify what government furnished equipment is provided. Define the exact equipment, by locations, to provide the contractor during the transfer of authority process. Understand the differences between government furnished equipment, theater provided equipment and installation provided equipment.  Include the G-1/AG and assistant chief of staff, finance and comptroller throughout the contracting process.  Schedule COR training as necessary.  Specify the exact period of the contract need, what the deliverable items are, if needed, and the desired degree of performance flexibility.  Describe the desired deliverables rather than how the work is accomplished or the number of hours provided.  Determine the availability of government support (includes security support) provided to contractors, and any conditions or limitations upon the availability or use of such services. This must be clearly set forth in the terms of the contract.  Identify potential degradation of contractor effectiveness during situations of tension or increased hostility. 6-48. It is also crucial to understand the terms and conditions of the contract to establish the relationship between the military (U.S. Government) and the contractor. This relationship does not extend through the contractor supervisor to his or her employees. Only the contractor can directly supervise its employees. The military chain of command exercises management control through the contract.

Each section describes the role, overview of HR support, and HR planning considerations, by echelon, for conducting personnel accounting and strength reporting, HR support to replacement and casualty operations, postal operations, and other HR considerations incorporated during LSCO. This chapter also provides an overview of HR training considerations for LSCO. OVERVIEW OF HR SUPPORT TO OPERATIONS TO SHAPE 7-1. During large-scale combat operations, the Army must anticipate peer threat capabilities extending across the battlefield throughout all domains (land, maritime, air, space, and cyberspace), from the strategic support area to the deep area. These threat capabilities will likely degrade sustainment information systems and interdict friendly air, land, and maritime operations, all of which are essential components enabling rapid OPLAN execution during contingency operations. To counter these threats during the steady-state competition period, major activities take place across the extended battlefield and at all levels: military readiness at home station; coordinating efforts at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels; and regional partnership building activities to ensure access and resource availability in theater. 7-2. Shape operations consist of various long-term military engagements, security cooperation, and deterrence missions, tasks, and actions intended to assure friends, build partner capacity and capability, and promote regional stability. Shape operations typically occur to support the geographic combatant commander's theater campaign plan or theater security cooperation plan. These operations help counter actions by adversaries that challenge the stability of a nation or region contrary to U.S. interests. As described in FM 3-0, there are four main purposes for shaping operations: promoting and protecting U.S. national interests and influence; building partner capacity and partnerships; recognizing and countering adversary attempts to gain positions of relative advantage; and setting conditions to win future conflicts. 7-3. Sustainment plays a key role in shaping operations and HR planners must be involved from the very beginning. Human resources shaping activities include planning and coordination to support the combatant commander’s requirements. Key HR activities within the overall sustainment requirements are ongoing and directly support operations to shape to set conditions to win future conflicts. This list is not all-inclusive, but intended to demonstrate the volume of activities for consideration while shaping the operational environment to support the geographic combatant commander's theater campaign plan. Conceptually, each activity aims to optimize sustainment capabilities in the context of the geographic combatant commander's theater campaign plan (analysis to optimize unit and individual readiness and support deployment and personnel/unit distribution–which feeds into effectively executing RSOI). These shaping activities occur continuously to support global and theater requirements during competition and help set the conditions for successful execution of operations during conflict. Key HR activities to shaping operations include––  Conduct home station training.  Perform OPLAN/concept plan refinement.  Conduct HR support to RSOI planning/coordination.  Perform casualty estimation; replacement planning (individual versus unit). Chapter 7 7-2 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Ensure enterprise integration (Global Combat Support System-Army, IPPS-A, General Fund Enterprise Business System).  Refine the TPFDD.  Conduct transition planning.  Conduct planning for HR operational contract support. 7-4. Successful HR support is dependent on careful planning, coordination, synchronization, and continuous integration with strategic partners during shaping activities and must occur to, during, and after military action. The objective of HR support is to maximize operational effectiveness by anticipating, manning, and sustaining military operations. Human resources support operations accomplish this by building, generating, and sustaining the force to provide combatant commanders with the forces required, setting conditions to win future conflicts. During the operations to shape phase, supporting and maintaining operational readiness occurs through key home station activities, which directly build, generate, and help sustain the force. Relationship building and maintenance with key HR strategic enablers (for example, HQDA G-1, HRC, the Adjutant General Directorate, Directorate of Military Personnel Management, and MPSA/USPS) are critical during operations to shape. Readiness management directly influences overall combat power and is critical during this phase. 7-5. During operations to shape, HR support involves the national-level capability to plan, resource, manage, and control the HR management life cycle functions for the Army. It involves integrating HR functions and activities across the Army staff, among the respective components, and among the Services. Human resources support during operations to shape include functions and tasks planned, coordinated, integrated, and executed by operational-level HR organizations and HROBs located within ESCs, DSBs, and sustainment brigades. These functions and tasks include PASR, postal operations, and HR support to replacement and casualty operations. Deliberate coordination and synchronization of these functions with strategic-level partners like the CMAOD for HR support to casualty operations, MPSA for postal operations, and Army HRC for HR support to replacement operations are critical to prolong endurance during LSCO. These habitual support relationships facilitate the combatant commander’s ability to extend operational reach. 7-6. Setting the theater is a continuous shaping activity conducted as part of steady-state posture to develop support for contingency or crisis response operations. Setting the theater involves theater opening; receiving initial forces, equipment, and supplies; assembling them into mission-tailored units, and ensuring transportation of those forces to reach their destination. The geographic combatant commander has overall responsibility for this activity; however, the ASCC, in large part via the TSC, coordinates a broad range of actions conducted to establish the conditions. The ASCC conducts theater analysis to identify risks in terms of access, capabilities, and capacities across the AOR as part of setting the theater. It consists of actions taken by sustainment and HR planners to optimize means for supporting the commander’s plan, which includes rapid response to emerging crises by employing the theater gateway with HR squads, and immediately setting conditions for HR support to replacement and casualty operations. 7-7. The ASCC G-1/AG performs a critical role for the geographic combatant commander in gaining operational access and positions of relative advantage throughout the AOR. During shaping activities, the ASCC G-1/AG coordinates with the corps/division to establish theater replacement management networks, personnel flow, and performs estimates for each. The ASCC G-1/AG also coordinates with the TPOC POD for postal flow. The ASCC G-1/AG refines and validates casualty estimates, and establishes/manages the personnel portion of reconstitution or reorganization efforts. To ensure initial HR capabilities are established before the main flow of forces arrival, HR support elements are included as part of the early entry element of the sustainment brigade assigned to the theater opening mission. The TPOC personnel accountability and systems division and the TG PAT establishes initial theater PASR and theater replacement networks. The TG PAT’s mission is to conduct PASR during the RSOI process, import and export personnel data from the Tactical Personnel System and DTAS, and conduct limited EPS for transient personnel. 7-8. Additional TG PATs and MMTs, with corresponding HR companies and platoons, could be required if more than one inter-theater port of debarkation is used for RSOI and/or mail flows. However, with multiple entry points, it may be necessary for initial PASR to be completed by the deploying units themselves. In this case, the arriving personnel data file is given to the TG PAT at the primary port of debarkation. HR Support and HR Planning Considerations during the Army Strategic Roles 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 7-3 Note: The TG PATs mission does not include conducting any other sustainment related requirements for life support and RSOI (for example, billeting, feeding, equipping, and transportation of transient personnel). The ASCC tasks the TSC who assigns the theater opening sustainment brigade, division sustainment support battalion, combat sustainment support battalion, or movement control team to conduct these activities. 7-9. Planning requirements include determining the number required and placement of HR elements and units within a theater of operations. Critical HR functions required during theater opening that must be considered during the MDMP for early entry elements include––  Initiate and establish theater PASR and personnel tracking.  Establish, operate, and maintain the theater personnel database.  Establish HR support for replacement operations; establish replacement operations plan.  Initiate, establish, and operate the theater CIC and conduct HR support to casualty operations.  Coordinate and synchronize the establishment of an MMT to support theater postal operations.  Estimate intra-theater mail movement usually by ground between the MMT and APOs. 7-10. The HROB is part of the early entry element of the theater opening sustainment brigade SPO, focusing on ensuring TG PAT personnel are included as part of the early entry element for theater opening and the establishment of initial personnel accounting and postal support. Early establishment of postal infrastructure during theater opening or early entry operations limits the requirements for postal restrictions and allows the flow of mail to commence earlier. The HROB receives technical guidance from the TPOC and higher-level HROBs and HROCs, while receiving sustainment and execution guidance from the SPO section and the commander. HR PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS BY ECHELON FOR OPERATIONS TO SHAPE 7-11. In general, planning considerations include a known or anticipated support requirement, a known or anticipated problem, a readiness issue, a capability shortfall, a threat, or an aspect of operational or mission variables influencing HR support. Human resources staff officers at every command level, starting with the battalion S-1, perform HR planning. Human resources planning is also conducted by the HROB within the ESC DMC and sustainment brigade SPO, the HR company, theater CIC, and all divisions within the TPOC. Human resources planning is a continual process that supports a commander’s ability to exercise command and control. Human resources planning requires an understanding of how to deliver HR support in the operational environment during LSCO. The following paragraphs, listed from strategic to tactical level, include HR planning considerations by echelon for operations to shape to support LSCO. HQDA G-1 7-12. Human resources planning considerations for the HQDA G-1 during operations to shape may include, but are not limited to—  HR support to replacement operations:  Synchronize with Army staff elements to optimize force-wide personnel readiness to serve the needs of the Army.  Coordinate with HQDA DCS G-3/5/7 to determine manning levels and turbulence thresholds for units within the operational force, operational depth, and generating force to include the institutional Army.  Provide integration and synchronization to identify/provide filler/personnel replacement requirements for each OPLAN (ASCC responsible).  HR support to casualty operations: Develop casualty reporting policy contingencies that go into effect in the event casualty reporting requirements exceed capacity. Chapter 7 7-4 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 HRC 7-13. Human resources planning considerations for the HRC during operations to shape may include, but are not limited to—  PASR: Error reconciliation and deviations in strength between HR systems.  HR support to replacement operations:  Execute total Army strength management on behalf of the HQDA DCS, G-1 to distribute Soldiers across the total force IAW HQDA’s established priorities during periods of mobilization when all three Army components are heavily leveraged to support LSCO or major contingency operations.  Maintain a manning COP that tracks MOS/area of concentration and grade composition of all sources of Soldiers available for distribution; authorities, resources, and amount of time to access each population of distributable Soldiers; and personnel strengths of units appropriately categorized to enable command decision making based on current mission requirements.  Distribute low-risk members of the training, transient, holdee, and student (for example, professional military education) and cross-level over-strength personnel to meet the Army’s prioritized personnel needs.  Redistribute excess members of units from the operational depth not deploying to a combat theater to theater Armies as required to resource their personnel requirements.  Initiate mobilization of members of the individual ready reserve to mitigate personnel shortfalls under LSCO.  Identify and provide filler, personnel replacements, and rotational personnel requirements.  Postal operations: Facilitate information flow between ASCCs, major commands, and MPSA/USPS on postal matters.  HR support to casualty operations:  Develop casualty reporting contingency plans based on HQDA G-1 policy that will go into effect if casualty reporting requirements exceed current capacities.  Synchronize with the theater CIC.  Synchronize with installation casualty assistance centers.  Other HR considerations: Authorization for unit stop loss and stop move implementation.

Human resources planning considerations for the MPSA/USPS during operations to shape may include, but are not limited to––  Conduct a postal estimate to identify rules of allocation based on postal service level(s).  Plan for restriction of mail service to letter class mail only.  Plan for availability of free mail. ASCC G-1/AG 7-15. Human resources planning considerations for the ASCC G-1/AG during operations to shape may include, but are not limited to—  PASR:  Identify and train HR personnel as part of the early entry element to establish initial PASR for the theater.  Plan and establish PASR policies, set priorities, identify internal and external HR support requirements for the theater, and coordinate with the combatant commander to ensure Army PASR policies are in synchronization with joint policies.  Plan for and train on procedures for manual PASR in preparation for degraded and disconnected operations. HR Support and HR Planning Considerations during the Army Strategic Roles 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 7-5  HR support to replacement operations:  Provide HQDA and the HRC with critical personnel planning assumptions associated with major OPLANs (for example, Army personnel replacement requirements).  Establish theater hierarchy associated with annex A, Task Organization, based on desired command relationships between theaters organic, assigned and attached units. Unit hierarchy used to establish permissions between strength managers who assign NRP and, when required, cross-level personnel amongst units.  Develop and approve replacement estimation and program individual casualty filler replacements in the TPFDD in coordination with the HRC.  Plan for and train on process/method for replacement flow to lower echelons.  Plan for changes to TPFDD forces geographic location of assignment in the event of a prolonged conflict.  Maintain awareness of positioning of replacement staging areas.  Request DUIC through HQDA, DCS G-3/5/7 Force Management.  Anticipate the volume of personnel replacements required and the associated – personnel flow requirements. Coordinate with the Soldier Support Institute, Fort Jackson, SC, to train personnel on the usage of the MPTk, and to receive permission to download and install the software. Ensure the organization has trained personnel available to access and operate these programs.  Postal operations:  Plan and coordinate postal operations within the theater G-1/AG AO.  Plan for disrupted postal flow – restricted to letter mail only (postal flow estimates).  Consider/authorize placement of the MPO in the corps consolidation area due to mobility of division HQ.  Consider adjusting roles and responsibilities by echelon depending on the operational environment.  Plan for processing/handling procedures for casualty mail (mass casualties).  Coordinate commercial internet for mail processing and USPS retail to support postal operations as the theater matures to support the ASCC’s contingency plan.  Ensure postal operations are included as part of tab A, appendix 2, to annex F of the OPORD or contingency plan. If Army postal organizations provide postal support to joint and multinational forces, they must be addressed in the OPORD.  Plan to liaise with the SPM, TSC/ESC, TPOC, and host-nation for postal functions.  Identify and process requests to the SPM for APO activations and deactivations.  Plan to assist the TSC/ESC, TPOC, and MMT in obtaining postal resources to support the theater postal mission.  Plan to monitor postal irregularities and postal offenses reported by the TPOC.  Ensure the TSC/ESC, TPOC, and MMT have systems in place to identify deficiencies in the postal operating system and takes appropriate actions to correct deficiencies.  Develop, in coordination with the TSC/ESC, TPOC, and MMT, procedures for addressing customer complaints, inquiries, suggestions, and for the expeditious return of casualty mail.  Plan to address or forward to the SPM all theater postal issues not resolved by the TSC/ESC, TPOC, or MMT.  HR support to casualty operations:  Develop a casualty OPLAN and policies for theater.  Establish policy for location of positioning of HR squads performing casualty liaison missions; identify additional locations requiring placement of casualty liaison support. Locations are in addition to the normal General Officer-level HQ, G-1/AGs, Role 3 MTFs, and mortuary affairs collection points. Chapter 7 7-6 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Establish casualty reporting authorities for submission of casualty reports (based on guidance and agreements from the JTF, joint forces land component command, and coalition forces land component command).  Develop a contingency policy authorizing the corps to approve and release casualty reporting directly to CMAOD – important under LSCO.  Establish the theater CIC as part of theater opening operations with the ASCC HROC.  Develop plan for DCIPS/casualty reporting requirements and time restraint adjustments in preparation for increased volume (mass casualties) or when degraded and disconnected operations occur.  Develop augmentation plan for possible increased workload of the theater CIC (mass casualties).  Train personnel on the usage of the MPTk, and to receive permission to download and install the software. Ensure the organization has trained personnel available to access and operate these programs.  Other HR considerations: Plan and coordinate early – establishment of SOPs required to determine type and frequency of data in the event of information systems black out. Manual use of logging actions will be the only alternative for HR systems. CORPS G-1/AG AND DIVISION G-1 7-16. Human resources planning considerations for the corps G-1/AG and division G-1 during operations to shape may include, but are not limited to—  PASR:  Coordinate Soldier readiness processing.  Create passenger manifests; provide information for force flow into theater.  Manage personnel readiness data and personnel information on all deploying personnel.  Plan for and train on procedures for manual PASR in preparation for degraded and disconnected operations.  Monitor error reconciliation and deviations in strength between HR systems.  Determine PASR reporting requirements for subordinate elements.  Conduct estimates and communicate personnel requirements to force provider.  HR support to replacement operations:  Assist the ASCC G-1/AG and the HRC in the development of replacement plans.  Determine personnel replacement flow to lower echelons.

HR TRAINING CONSIDERATIONS FOR OPERATIONS TO SHAPE 7-24. The complex and uncertain environment of LSCO presents several new challenges for HR training. Large-scale combat operations will be conducted across a geographically dispersed area without defined secure areas in all domains (for example, land and cyber) requiring an accurate and near real-time sustainment COP (including HR) to inform commanders. Human resources organizations and their commands will continually move to avoid detection and hostile intent (for example, long-range fires, special operation forces, criminals, and non-state actors) during LSCO making HR support and personnel asset visibility infinitely more difficult. 7-25. Training and readiness of HR elements are critical to plan and accomplish HR functions and is key to the development of a shared understanding of sustaining manpower, which is critical to the success of the Army’s mission.In preparation for LSCO, HR training must include the planning for HR operations to support replacement and casualty operations, casualty estimation, and PASR. Human resources training must support how to conduct these operations. Human resources support to replacement operations training must include planning for replacements, prioritizing and resourcing of replacements, and providing replacement personnel to commanders. When developing training, it is essential to include conducting HR operations during degraded, denied, or disrupted network conditions. Rehearse manual back-up and validation procedures. Human resources organizations and professionals that are appropriately trained provide commanders a shared understanding of manpower and the planning and resourcing of personnel in all phases. HOME STATION TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HR SOLDIERS AND ORGANIZATIONS 7-26. Human resources organizations should maximize real-world training opportunities focusing on unit specific core functions, capabilities, and technical roles to ensure their own unit preparedness to deploy and assist with the improvement of garrison HR operations during LSCO. The following home station training opportunities for HR Soldiers and organizations include— HR Support and HR Planning Considerations during the Army Strategic Roles 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 7-11  Readiness training:  Process mail at APOs or retail APOs.  Inspect installation and unit mailrooms.  Conduct mission readiness exercise/mission rehearsal exercise reception operations.  Serve as a liaison at a casualty assistance center.  Serve as an observer, controller, or mentor.  Conduct installation manifesting.  Assist with installation PRM/PASR/PIM.  Provide SRP support.  Provide assistance and training on HR systems to supported units, agencies, and the military personnel division.  Provide record updates for installation units.  Provide support in the areas of promotions, administrative separation actions, medical readiness requirements, compassionate reassignments, officer candidate school applications, military testing, and voting assistance.  Provide records accountability and maintenance, in and out processing of personnel, ID card and CAC issuance, Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System enrollment, and installation mobilization activities.  Provide transition support for all Active, ARNG, and USAR Soldiers separating from the military.  Cross-train to increase multi-functional effectiveness of HR organizations.  Individual capabilities:  Familiarize with HR systems functional guidance.  Train with Warrior Training Support packages from the Soldier Support Institute Learning Resource Center website.  Attend installation training (for example, S-1 Course and HR systems training).  Attend formal training (for example, HR Plans and Operations Course, Brigade S-1 Course, and Postal Supervisor Course).  Utilize FORSCOM, Soldier Support Institute, and Sustainment Center of Excellence Mobile Training teams.  Attend SPO Phase I Course Online.

Analyze COAs, determine advantages and disadvantages, and compare COAs.  Pre-deployment training:  Incorporate sustainment brigade and ESC HROBs into training crosswalks.  Evaluate HR application of the MDMP. Chapter 7 7-12 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Evaluate collaboration points.  Evaluate individual and collective tasks.  Establish mock APOs.  Train on the Automated Military Postal System using a training ZIP Code.  Train on the DTAS, DCIPS, Tactical Personnel System, Very Small Aperture Terminal, and the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System.  Utilize non-HR specific systems (for example, Command Post of the Future).  Attend regional HR and sustainment conferences.  Attend regional multi-echelon, multi-component net centric mission readiness exercises and mission rehearsal exercises in Active, Reserve, and ARNG communities.  Participate in exercises as an observer/controller/mentor.  Provide sample situational training exercises for use by leaders to develop training exercises for their units.  Establish training and evaluation outlines to provide the training criteria for tasks that the unit must master to perform critical wartime operations. These training criteria orient on the levels of collective training executed by the unit. Each outline can be applicable to one or more operations.  Train postal platoons to be multi-functional (capable of personnel accounting and casualty reporting missions).  Participate in early planning conferences for all major exercises to ensure HR support is exercised in a realistic manner to replicate the scope and scale of HR (for example, PERSTAT and personnel requirements report submission, casualty reporting fully implemented, non-unit replacement operations only occur if coordinated and realistic). HR LEADER DEVELOPMENT 7-27. Development of HR leaders must include training that enables them to properly understand and plan all HR functions during LSCO. Human resources leaders must ensure HR operations can continue in conditions of degraded or denied networks to include cyber and electronic warfare environments. Trained HR leaders will be able to perform HR operations and communicate HR operational impacts of manning, in concert with battle tracking to ensure commanders have a shared understanding of combat power. During LSCO, comprehension of HR operations and manning allows commanders to make rapid and informed operational decisions based on the manning resources of the force. 7-28. Human resources leader development in a non-deployed environment is driven by ADRP 1-03. Brigade S-1s must ensure subordinate battalion S-1s develop individual and collective task lists and assess training tasks and objectives at least quarterly. Additionally, brigade S-1s must validate or coordinate for validation of all battalion S-1 training assessments. Listed below are some key areas HR leaders can train on to ensure mission success during LSCO.  Understand and plan the mission:  Train on the operations process (Plan, Prepare, Execute, and Assess).  Understand and execute planning horizons, short-range planning and execution, mid-range planning, and long-range planning.  Train on the execution of the MDMP.  Train on the execution of the rapid decision-making and synchronization process.  Know what HR, postal, and casualty input goes into OPORDs.  Use the orders process to ensure coordination with other staff and support elements to accomplish HR operations.  Degraded or denied networks:  Coordinate with higher echelons to receive reporting requirements during periods of degraded or denied communications.  Conduct battle drills that require reporting with little to no connectivity. HR Support and HR Planning Considerations during the Army Strategic Roles 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 7-13  Leverage standardized HR reports and timelines.  Operational impacts of manning:  Train on personnel readiness management so leaders can analyze personnel strength data to determine current combat capabilities, project future requirements, and assess conditions of individual readiness.  Train on personnel accountability to ensure commanders know the location and duty status of every person assigned or attached to their organization.  Train on strength reporting to accurately reflect the combat power of the unit to monitor unit strength, prioritize replacements, monitor deployable and non-deployable personnel, and execute strength distribution to make tactical and HR support decisions. OVERVIEW OF HR SUPPORT TO OPERATIONS TO PREVENT 7-29. Operations to prevent are characterized by actions to protect friendly forces and indicate the intent to execute subsequent phases of a planned operation. During operations to prevent, necessary actions are taken to deter adversary actions contrary to U.S. interests, respond to actions that threaten unified action partners, and deploy credible forces to demonstrate the willingness to fight should deterrence fail. Peer threat capabilities remain the same as those seen in shaping operations. Major activities taking place across the extended battlefield and at all levels are execution of flexible deterrent options and flexible response options, setting the theater, tailor Army forces, and project the force. The HR community directly supports the purpose of operations to prevent by enabling the deployment of credible forces to the theater if deterrence fails. 7-30. As with operations to shape, key HR activities within the overall sustainment requirements are ongoing and directly support operations to prevent to set conditions for future success. Again, this list is not all-inclusive, but demonstrates the volume of activities for consideration while shaping the operational environment to support the geographic combatant commander's theater campaign plan. These activities aim to enhance sustainment capabilities directly supporting the geographic combatant commander's theater campaign plan, which feeds into effectively executing RSOI, one of the key tasks of sustainment in the prevent strategic role. These activities support global and theater requirements during competition and help set the conditions for successful execution of operations during conflict. Key HR activities for operations to prevent include––  Conduct home station training.  Ensure enterprise integration (Global Combat Support System-Army, IPPS-A, General Fund Enterprise Business System).  Conduct HR support to RSOI.  Perform OPLAN/concept plan execution.  Reposition and reorganize forces.  Conduct non-combatant evacuation operations.  Conduct transition planning.  Provide operational contract support optimization.  Perform postal operations.  Refine TPFDD-rotational forces execution. 7-31. During operations to prevent, effective, accurate, and timely HR support during theater opening requires detailed preparation and planning during LSCO. Setting the theater involves significant HR support activities. The most critical of all HR theater opening tasks is conducted during RSOI – establishment of the theater personnel database and infrastructure that can capture personnel accounting data on personnel entering the theater. To ensure initial establishment of HR capabilities before arrival of the main flow of forces, HR elements are included as part of the early entry element of the sustainment brigade assigned to the theater opening mission (for example, ASCC G-1/AG, TPOC, theater CIC, HROB, TG PAT, MMT, HR company and platoons). Critical HR functions required for theater opening during operations to prevent include––  Establish theater PASR and personnel tracking policy and procedures.  Establish and operate the theater personnel database. Chapter 7 7-14 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Establish HR support for replacement operations.  Establish and operate the theater CIC.  Establish initial theater postal operations. 7-32. During operations to prevent, early TPFDD divisions and brigades have pushed forward out of the strategic support area into the joint security area. Human resources elements continue assisting commanders with setting the theater, tailoring and projecting HR support to the force. Brigade S-1s identify shortages and requirements for HRC to bring their units up to authorization in preparation for LSCO (individual replacements identified for unit manning may be identified as late deployers). 7-33. In the operational support area, the ASCC G-1/AG continues planning, establishing policy, setting priorities, and managing PASR for the theater and identifies internal and external HR support requirements. The ASCC G-1/AG continues coordinating with the combatant commander to ensure Army PASR policies synchronize with joint policies and field army requirements. The ASCC G-1/AG continues planning, coordinating, and managing casualty operations for the theater and identifies any additional locations requiring placement of casualty liaison elements. These locations are in addition to the normal General Officer-level HQ, G-1/AGs, Role 3 MTFs, and mortuary affairs collection points. The ASCC G-1/AG also continues planning, coordinating, establishing, and managing postal operations for the theater, and identifies and coordinates with the TSC and TPOC to ensure adequate postal operations resources are available throughout the theater AO. 7-34. In the division AO/division consolidation area, the division G-1 conducts key HR tasks such as PASR, HR support to casualty operations, PRM, EPS, and PIM. They also maintain personnel asset visibility throughout all operations and collect data gathered by subordinate S-1s to adjust HR support to subordinate organizations as required. 7-35. In the brigade AO/brigade consolidation area, generally, there are no HR companies or any other SRC 12 element supporting brigades. However, with proper coordination between brigade S-1s and division G-1, additional support may be requested from the supported division. In support of RSOI, S-1s continue to focus on manning the force and HR support to casualty operations (casualty reporting). They also perform mailroom operations and continue providing EPS for their organizations. Brigade and subordinate S-1s receive and track all attached and assigned Soldiers, DOD and DA Civilians, and CAAF operating in the unit’s AO. Maintaining visibility through operations and tactical enablers assists S-1s in gathering data necessary to perform their missions. Tactical communications can provide information on unit moves, casualties, task organization changes, and other information affecting HR operations. Maintaining this visibility provides redundant and new information that S-1s can input into the HR system of record. HR PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS BY ECHELON FOR OPERATIONS TO PREVENT 7-36.

Chapter 7 7-22 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 OVERVIEW OF HR SUPPORT TO LARGE-SCALE COMBAT OPERATIONS (DEFENSIVE/OFFENSIVE) 7-49. Under large-scale combat operations, the operational environment remains a complex extended battlefield against a peer adversary; deterrence efforts have failed, force projection operations are underway, decisive action operations have commenced. Characteristics of sustaining LSCO include volume, lethality, precision, and tempo. Peer threats with modern weapons employed en masse will have the potential to overwhelm maintenance, medical, replacement personnel, and mortuary affairs capabilities. Peer threats can influence and direct irregular forces, criminal elements and hostile populations, and can impose disruptive effects in cyberspace challenging Army sustainment during force projection. The threat will employ their resources across multiple domains to attack U.S. vulnerabilities including sustainment facilities, networks, and formations. They create lethal and non-lethal effects throughout the operational environment; seek to inflict significant damage across multiple domains in a short period and see to delay friendly forces long enough to achieve their goals. 7-50. Based on the peer threat capability across multiple domains, formations conducting decisive action within the JOA will need to establish smaller temporary bases that are more dispersed and mobile than conventional bases. Considering the credible threat capability and dispersed array of friendly forces, LSCO will require a higher volume of personnel, materiel, and equipment significantly greater than other types of operations. Large-scale combat operations will necessitate high operational tempo and is more lethal than other types of operations resulting in more casualties (mass casualties), replacement personnel, and equipment on a larger scale. 7-51. During defensive and offensive operations, HR planners should expect large numbers of casualties in a short period or over extended depths of the battlefield and must be prepared to process mass casualties and replacement personnel on a large-scale to include reconstitution to maintain PASR and to build and sustain combat power. Personnel replacements must be forecasted and any lack of replacement capacity briefed to maneuver commanders as a risk to the mission. A high intensity operational tempo, coupled with potentially degraded systems and communications, will negatively impact personnel status and casualty reporting. Human resources planners can also utilize push package planning to forward position replacements and assist with replacement flow. If communications are degraded, sustainers automatically dispatch these push packages to supported units. 7-52. During LSCO, HR elements focus on accurate and timely personnel accounting, information, and readiness management to rapidly generate and sustain combat power. Key HR entities to support defensive and offensive operations during LSCO will be challenged by degraded communication (reporting latency and accuracy issues) and highly-contested, lethal and non-lethal environments. To support RSOI, support to replacement and casualty operations are two of the key tasks that must be prioritized and synchronized to allow commanders the freedom of action to maneuver and provide extended operational reach. Key HR activities identified for LSCO (defensive/offensive) include––  Personnel asset visibility/strength reporting.  HR support to replacement operations (RSOI).  HR support to casualty operations (casualty reporting).  HR support to reconstitution operations. 7-53. During LSCO, the ASCC G-1/AG continues planning and prioritizing HR support to assure a unity of purpose and effort maximizing the readiness and operations capabilities of forces within theater. The ASCC G-1/AG continues to monitor strength and determine replacement priorities with the G-3/commander, monitor replacement operations, and monitor any reassignments to meet operational requirements. 7-54. The TPOC continues to integrate and execute planning, PASR, and postal operations (with respective restrictions, if any) throughout the theater as defined by the ASCC G-1/AG. The TPOC provides technical guidance and oversight to theater HR elements and coordinates with the TSC for replacement flow. 7-55. Human resources operations branches, collocated with ESC DMCs and sustainment brigade SPOs, continue planning, coordinating, integrating, and synchronizing and allocating HR support to casualty operations, postal operations missions, and HR assets within the DSB and ESC AO. They also continue to serve as the main integrator between the TPOC and assigned and attached HR units (HR company, TG PAT, HR Support and HR Planning Considerations during the Army Strategic Roles 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 7-23 and MMT) and as the primary integrator between supported units (G-1/S-1) and sustainment organizations for external HR support. The HROBs also continue synchronizing non-HR support requirements with other sustainment elements and organizations; planning, projecting, and recommending HR support requirements for current and future military operations using MDMP; and ensuring the emplacement and displacement of HR support organizations are in synchronization with the concept of support plan for PASR, HR support to casualty operations, and postal operations during LSCO. 7-56. In corps support areas, corps G-1/AGs continue to execute procedures IAW ASCC policies and procedures in their respective AOR. They continue to review and refine HR plans, strength reporting, casualty reporting and tracking, and personnel readiness management as necessary to ensure they report timely and essential information to inform replacement priorities set by the ASCC. At some point, a Task Force Reconstitution commander is identified and close coordination with that commander is required to support reconstitution capabilities. 7-57. In division support areas, division G-1s continue to execute IAW ASCC and corps policies and procedures. They continue to conduct HR planning, strength reporting, HR support to casualty operations (casualty reporting), and personnel readiness management as necessary to ensure they report essential information to inform replacement priorities. 7-58. In brigade support areas, subordinate brigade and battalion S-1s across the battlefield continue to plan, provide, and coordinate the delivery of HR support, services, or information to all assigned/attached personnel within their HQ and subordinate battalions or companies. Their primary focus during LSCO is PASR and casualty reporting which directly affects the personnel readiness management functions supporting replacement and reorganization operations. They accomplish these tasks by monitoring, collecting, and verifying HR related information and then reporting the information in the appropriate HR system of record. Human resources support information directly impacts the commander’s COP as it pertains to combat capability (for example, crew status, personnel shortages, and unit strengths). They continue coordinating with higher HQ S-1/G-1/AGs and the HROB SPO for external HR assets and support as necessary. During operational pauses, or as the commander directs, HR support may also include EPS or Army band support for morale and welfare, recognizing cultural and historical traditions, and memorial and ceremonial events.

Possible use of RC forces or OCS to replace HR platoons. OVERVIEW OF HR SUPPORT TO OPERATIONS TO CONSOLIDATE GAINS 7-72. During operations to consolidate gains, the operational environment remains a complex extended battlefield. Remnant peer adversary forces may pose a threat, but U.S. forces may face hybrid threats from insurgent forces and criminal organizations. Units may initially conduct only minimal stability tasks while the focus remains on security. A transition to stability-focused operations will occur as security improves. 7-73. Successful operations to consolidate gains employ a combination of offensive, defensive, and stability tasks as well as the entirety of the elements of national power to achieve success. We must assume that enemy forces will employ all remaining available capabilities to protract the conflict, even as organized enemy resistance declines. To defeat these efforts, commanders consider both the purpose of an operation and the capacity for the enemy to resist. Success depends on the commander’s ability to exploit tactical success by establishing security and stability in a manner sufficiently decisive to achieve national strategic aims. 7-74. Sustainment priorities continue to focus on support to maneuver forces. However, as the area becomes more secure, priorities may shift to humanitarian assistance (such as providing food, water, shelter, and medical support), engineering (restoration of essential services), and security force assistance activities. Sustainment organizations consider these shifts during initial stages of operational planning to execute support in a timely and effective manner. 7-75. Sustainment of consolidation of gains may involve the provision of essential government services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and humanitarian relief for the local population. Typically, it involves support for both U.S. forces and other unified action partners. Forces conducting operations to consolidate gains may require the full complement of sustainment capabilities, especially if those operations are prolonged. 7-76. Key HR activities during operations to consolidate gains aim to enhance sustainment capabilities that directly support the geographic combatant commander’s theater campaign plan. The plan feeds into Chapter 7 7-32 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 effectively maintaining tempo and enabling the transition from armed conflict to renewed competition, one of the key tasks of sustainment in the operations to consolidate gains strategic role. Key HR activities to operations to consolidate gains include––  Maintain personnel asset visibility.  Conduct transition planning.  Coordinate redeployment.  Continue reorganization operations.  Conduct postal operations. 7-77. During operations to consolidate gains, deployed forces conduct activities to set conditions for a stable environment. Forces remain arrayed similarly in the supporting areas as the previous role with theater supporting forces in the joint security area. Human resources elements continue focusing on reorganization and transition planning to support area security operations, primary stability tasks, and follow-on operations. Key HR tasks remain personnel asset visibility, casualty reporting/status updates, and postal operations. Some units may remain in contact with the enemy while others initiate the operations to consolidate gains role. Human resources elements consolidate gains throughout all strategic roles. However, following the tempo of LSCO and the volume of personnel movement on the battlefield (casualties and replacements), HR elements will focus on providing personnel readiness management and reporting for units still in contact, redeployment operations, and supporting closing the theater. Human resources elements resume postal flow (if restricted or limited) and initiate the process to discontinue overall mail flow into theater to support redeployment operations. 7-78. The field army is primarily responsible for orchestrating operations to consolidate gains while there is still a significant threat of violence. The G-1/AG must provide commanders enough information enabling them to plan, set, and continually adjust the conditions for a more favorable return to competition and a new normal mainly in planning, requesting, coordinating, and allocating the required resources, and prioritizing efforts across the entire AO. 7-79. The ASCC G-1/AG anticipates and requests additional combat force replacements and coordinates the mechanisms required to move those capabilities into and out of theater and regenerate forces. During the final phases of consolidating gains, the G-1/AG plans and coordinates the redeployment of Army forces, and revises its long-term security cooperation plan for the new post-conflict security environment. 7-80. In corps support areas, G-1/AGs continue to support commanders in shaping the environment. The corps assumes responsibility for operations to consolidate gains across the battlespace as the level of violence subsides and the number of committed friendly forces in the battlespace lessens to a corps or less. The G-1/AG continues supporting commanders with direct involvement in conducting the deliberate planning and preparation to consolidate gains following the tactical success of its subordinate divisions. The corps is responsible for overall planning, preparation, execution, and assessment to allow divisions and their brigade combat teams to remain focused on retaining the initiative and maneuvering without loss of momentum. The corps continually reorganizes its AO as appropriate to best facilitate rapid consolidation of gains and cannot do this without accurate and timely personnel information (for example, personnel strength, replacement personnel, and casualties). 7-81. In division support areas, G-1s continue to support commanders in shaping the environment. As part of its singular focus on winning the close fight, the division concentrates first on consolidation versus consolidating gains following tactical success. The division can organize a consolidation area and plan and conduct longer-term stability tasks as a second priority when directed and provided more forces and other appropriate resources. The corps may task a follow-and-support division to command and control the corps’ consolidation area as it grows during the campaign. 7-82. In brigade support areas, S-1s continue performing deployment and RSOI HR core competency tasks, with priority on unit reorganization/regeneration and/or redeployment back to home station. Brigade S-1s maintain sufficient HR capability to accomplish redeployment tasks. At the tactical brigade-level the emphasis is on identifying personnel who may redeploy individually, preparing unit personnel for redeployment and redeployment tasks, and EPS actions. HR Support and HR Planning Considerations during the Army Strategic Roles 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 7-33 THEATER REDEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS DURING OPERATIONS TO CONSOLIDATE GAINS 7-83. The redeployment of forces from a theater of operations requires the same level of preparation and planning as for theater opening. For the HR community, there are four major redeployment concerns:  Ensure an adequate number of HR elements remain in theater to conduct the redeployment process while reducing the HR support structure.  Maintain PASR of redeploying forces.  Assist in the reconstitution or reorganization effort, if applicable.  Manage the flow of personnel to home stations. 7-84. Throughout the redeployment process, the TPOC maintains the capability and ability to maintain PASR, and limited postal support during all phases of redeployment. This is crucial, as not all forces redeploy simultaneously. As forces redeploy incrementally, so should the drawdown of HR units. 7-85. Like theater opening, planning for the redeployment of forces from a theater is critical to successful execution of the redeployment process. Human resources planners from the ASCC G-1/AG, TPOC, and ESC HROB are involved in all phases of redeployment planning to––  Ensure the theater-wide plan for redeploying includes incremental drawdown of the HR support structure.  Determine if HR units or support elements should redeploy by unit or element.  Determine the need, if any, to sustain a residual force to support post conflict activities.  Develop redeployment procedures for individuals and units.  Plan to conduct unit reconstitution or reorganization before redeployment (if necessary or required).  Identify any additional theater departure points. As forces redeploy, additional departure points may be used. As such, planning should include the need to provide or add personnel accounting capabilities at these locations.  Consider if additional liaison personnel are needed, and if so, the proposed locations. This includes liaison with aero medical evacuation to maintain accountability.  Determine if a need exists to add additional CAC issuance capability at departure points. It may be necessary to replace many lost or expired CACs.  Maintain connectivity during the redeployment process for PASR and HR support to casualty operations.  Identify other specific requirements. For example, when redeployment, deployment, and sustaining operations occur simultaneously, the TSC/ESC and TPOC may find it necessary to rebalance or surge HR support personnel to support on-going operations and redeployment. 7-86. The same HR elements that conducted PASR, HR support to replacement operations and casualty operations, and postal operations during theater opening or HR sustainment perform similar roles during redeployment. Human resources support requirements vary depending on the nature and scale of redeployment operations. For example, redeployment operations could range from limited personnel to entire units. Depending upon the military strategy, unit rotations may still occur while other units redeploy. Key considerations include, but are not limited to––  Size of the force redeploying and deploying.  Infrastructure requirements and limitations.  Staging area capacities.  Transportation decisions. 7-87. The challenge for planning HR support operations is effective coordination and synchronization, vertically and horizontally, to ensure responsive and simultaneous support to on-going HR support operations and redeployment operations. The HROB in the ESC and sustainment brigade is critical to the coordination and synchronization effort. Chapter 7 7-34 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 PERSONNEL ACCOUNTING AND STRENGTH REPORTING 7-88. Throughout the redeployment process, the most critical of all HR functions is PASR. Personnel accounting and strength reporting includes all personnel listed in the theater database and includes Soldiers, joint, and multinational personnel, DOD and DA Civilians, and CAAF. 7-89. The following organizations have responsibilities for the redeployment of personnel:  ASCC G-1/AG – Develops the theater-level plan in coordination with the TPOC and the ESC HROB. The redeployment plan includes unit and command responsibilities; processing procedures for joint, DOD and DA Civilians, and CAAF; and specific procedures for processing for demobilizing RC Soldiers.  TPOC – Establishes and maintains the theater database; coordinates with the ESC HROB to identify points of departures; determines how to provide HR support during the drawdown; identifies HR units and planned redeployment schedules; and if necessary, develops a plan to sustain any residual force for post conflict activities.  ESC and sustainment brigade HROBs – Develops a redeployment schedule for redeploying HR units while simultaneously maintaining PASR, and ensures HR units redeploying late in the plan have the necessary communications and logistics support.  HR company – Provides HR unit redeploying recommendations to the HROB; personnel accounting coverage at designated points of departure; CAC support at departure points; and considers use of HR elements previously conducting casualty liaison as augmentation to personnel accounting elements or the plans and operations section. 7-90. Generally, most unit personnel redeploy with their unit. However, some unit personnel redeploy before the unit. These personnel can be unit advance parties, individual augmentees, or other personnel who deploy separately from their units. Unit S-1s have a responsibility to maintain accountability of personnel redeploying with the unit. They also have the responsibility to manifest their personnel and to provide the personnel accounting elements at theater exit point a list of their manifested personnel. The personnel accounting elements then have the responsibility to inactivate personnel from the theater database who have departed from the theater of operations. The personnel accounting elements perform the same responsibilities for redeploying personnel as they do for theater opening and sustainment operations. HR SUPPORT TO CASUALTY OPERATIONS 7-91. Depending on the operational environment, casualties may continue to occur during operations to consolidate gains. Individuals may also be killed or injured due to non-battle injuries. As such, the capability to provide HR support to casualty operations during the redeployment of personnel and units must be maintained. This includes the operation of the theater CIC. Casualty operations are one of the last theater HR functions to close. 7-92. Once the decision is made to close the theater CIC, the synchronization and coordination to transfer the casualty function is made with CMAOD to ensure casualty-reporting responsibilities are appropriately handed off to another designated theater CIC or casualty element. CLOSING POSTAL OPERATIONS 7-93. When closing postal operations, the redeployment of postal units in theater requires more detailed planning than PASR and HR support to casualty operations. Redeployment planning involves not only theater-wide postal units, but also supporting HROBs, ESC, TPOC, and the ASCC G-1/AG. It also involves coordination and synchronization with external agencies (for example, MPSA and JMPA). Redeployment of postal elements and closing of APOs is synchronized with the redeployment schedule for units supported by the APO or postal element. 7-94. It is critical that HR planners at all levels be involved early in the redeployment planning process. At a minimum, closing or relocating an APO requires 90 days advance notification. If possible, notifications should be at least 120 days before closing the APO. This notification is needed to––  Ensure appropriate notifications are submitted to JMPA and MPSA and approved. HR Support and HR Planning Considerations during the Army Strategic Roles 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 7-35  Provide time to coordinate and synchronize turning-in of excess postal supplies and equipment.  Conduct necessary audits for accountable items (for example, stamps and money orders).  Notify supported organizations and family members when mail services will be terminated.  Notify the MMT at the APOD for redirecting mail. 7-95. The ASCC G-1/AG responsibilities for managing the redeployment of postal operations and closing of APOs are––  Participate with TPOC and ESC HROB in preparation of a redeployment postal support plan.  Provide ASCC-level guidance and establish redeployment priorities. 7-96. The TPOC POD is responsible to notify MPSA and the servicing JMPA as far in advance of the actual closure date as possible. Notification to MPSA includes––  Listing affected ZIP Codes.  Listing closing dates by ZIP Codes.  Listing of all organizations and activities using the APO as their mailing address. Providing disposition instructions for mail.  Designating an APO to which active postal offense cases are forwarded, and all postal files and records are maintained due to closure of postal facilities.  Requesting disposition instructions from the appropriate JMPA for USPS equipment and supplies.  Coordinating and synchronizing with the ESC or sustainment brigade HROB on redeployment schedules and closing of APOs and the MMT. 7-97. The ESC, TPOC POD, and the HROB, in a coordinated effort, are responsible for developing a redeployment plan and schedule for redeploying theater postal units. The plan includes redeployment schedules of postal units and ensures postal units have the connectivity needed to conduct postal operations as units redeploy. The TPOC POD and the HROB ensure issues arising during the redeployment are resolved. It also ensures (in coordination with TPOC), the MMT initiates redirect surface mail for affected units before closing the APO. 7-98. The TPOC POD provides assistance and oversight to the HR company for ensuring the HROB is aware of proper procedures for closing APOs. The HR company plans and operations section ensures the following requirements are considered:  Provide supporting units and customers with at least a 90-day termination of support notice.  Transfer active postal offense case files to the designated APO.  Comply with the DOD Postal Manual for disposition instructions for money orders, stamp stock, and meters.  Refer to DOD 4525.6-C, DOD Postal Supply Catalog, for supplies and equipment.  Perform an audit of accountable postal affects, including equipment, at the close of business on the last day of operation or as soon thereafter as practical. Two postal officials appointed for this purpose must conduct the audit. The Custodian of Postal Effects may not be an auditor, but must be present during the audit.  Dispose of records, and comply with appropriate military department, USPS, and MPSA disposition instructions.  Coordinate new address and mail routing instructions for all units redeploying.  Coordinate and publicize APO closures to coincide with the drawdown of personnel.  Reduce postal services 30 days before closure.  Include instructions for disposing mail and equipment in evacuation and destruction plans of all units operating a mail facility. When sufficient warning is received APOs will––  Deliver to addressee or dispatch mail on hand to the nearest postal facility by the safest and most expeditious means available.  Suspend operations and transport postal affects and supplies to a safe and secure location. Chapter 7 7-36 FM 1-0 25 August 2021  Perform emergency destruction of mail and postal affects, when there is insufficient warning. If possible, ensure a witness observes personnel conducting the emergency destruction. Submit a list of destroyed items to the ASCC G-1/AG. Perform destruction in the following order:  Official registered mail.  Directory service information.  Blank postal money order forms.  Postal stamps and stamped paper.  Paid money orders and checks on hand.  Money order printer.  Other accountable mail.  All remaining mail.  All-purpose date and canceling stamps.  All other records, equipment, mail sacks, and furniture.

This is important for Chapter 7 7-40 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 Combat Service Support Automated Information Systems Interface/Very Small Aperture Terminal operations.  Anticipate cyber threats/attacks – cyber threats or attacks on automation and communications systems will deny, degrade, and disrupt PASR and the casualty tracking and reporting flow. Only contingency for degraded HR systems is the use of manual data entry/delivery.  Refine SOPs to determine type and frequency of data in the event of information systems black out. Manual use of logging actions will be the only alternative for HR systems.  Plan for the inability to feed the commander’s COP with appropriate information. Timeliness and accuracy of PERSTAT reports will likely be degraded during LSCO, which limits responsiveness to supported units.  Plan for possibility of corps G-1/AGs and division G-1s degraded over time with focus and requirements shifting back to corps/division to fight as formations during LSCO (defensive/offensive). Therefore, casualty reporting, PASR, strength management, and HR support to replacement operations may require additional SRC 12 (theater HR organizations) support at echelon. Plan for reintegration of the rear detachment. BRIGADE AND BATTALION S-1 7-105. Human resources planning considerations for the brigade and battalion S-1 during operations to consolidate gains may include, but are not limited to––  PASR:  Manage personnel asset visibility – maintain PASR of Soldiers and DOD and DA Civilians.  Plan for S-1 personnel to accompany the advance party to maintain PASR while redeploying, if applicable.  Plan for manual PASR during degraded and disconnected operations.  Plan to provide liaisons at inter-theater APODs to track unit personnel flow.  HR support to replacement operations:  Identify and report critical MOS and key leader shortages to higher echelons.  Identify secondary MOS of assigned Soldiers for potential backfills.  Maintain and assess Soldier and unit readiness.  Coordinate with the S-3 and S-4 for operational and logistics support during replacement operations.  Postal operations:  Collect and forward mail for missing, deceased, or wounded Soldiers to the APO for further processing.  Reassess mail flow and unit responsibilities in receiving mail.  Complete and submit change of address cards if redeploying.  HR support to casualty operations:  Plan for DCIPS/Casualty reporting – Brigade and battalion capacity during operations to consolidate gains will likely require adjustments to reporting/timeliness expectations from the increased volume (mass casualties) and degraded communication capabilities during LSCO (defensive/offensive).  Maintain lines of communication with casualty elements and casualty collection areas to monitor casualty reporting and transportation of remains.  Other HR considerations:  Conduct EPS as the commander directs and as operational conditions allow (for example, wartime standards for promotion, posthumous awards, citizenship applications for Soldiers, stop loss/stop move).  Provide MWR support for prolonged operations to consolidate gains.  Manage completion of LOD investigations. HR Support and HR Planning Considerations during the Army Strategic Roles 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 7-41  Prepare for unit relief in place, if applicable.  Understand how terrain and distance may have limited/degraded communication during LSCO (defensive/offensive) and forced utilization of retransmit stations. This is important for Combat Service Support Automated Information Systems Interface/Very Small Aperture Terminal operations.  Anticipate cyber threats/attacks – cyber threats or attacks on automation and communications systems will deny, degrade, and disrupt PASR and the casualty tracking and reporting flow. Only contingency for degraded HR systems is the use of manual data entry/delivery.  Refine SOPs to determine type and frequency of data in the event of information systems black out. Manual use of logging actions will be the only alternative for HR systems.  Plan for the inability to provide timely and accurate information to the commander’s COP. Implications associated with LSCO will hinder timely and accurate submission of PERSTAT reports, which will limit responsiveness to the supported units. TPOC 7-106.

Contingency for degraded HR systems is the use of manual data entry/delivery.  Monitor and retrain, if needed, HR and postal elements on procedures for manual reporting during degraded and disconnected for follow-on operations.  Monitor rules of allocation and coordinate with HROB and TPOC for potential additional SRC 12 augmentation.  Refine tracking metrics for all HR elements assigned.  Advise HROBs on location and workload of personnel accounting, casualty liaison, and postal elements. Additionally, advise HROBs on follow-on assignment or redeployment of personnel accounting, casualty liaison, and postal elements.  Disseminate mission changes from the HROB and TPOC to subordinate HR and postal elements.  Assist as a liaison for signal support between HR and postal elements and the battalion or brigade S-6.  Plan for loss of HR platoons if attacked. Possible use of RC forces or OCS to replace HR platoons. 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 A-1 Appendix A Human Resources Automation Support Human resources databases and systems are essential in accomplishing Army-wide personnel information management and requires a team of HR professionals who are competent in using them. It is critical to ensure HR professionals are cross-trained on all HR databases and systems. This appendix describes specific HR databases, systems, and other automation systems and equipment used by HR professionals to perform HR missions at theater, brigade, and battalion-levels. For HR professionals to conduct required HR functions and tasks, immediate NIPRNET and SIPRNET connectivity should be at the top of a unit’s priority list when arriving in theater. HR DATABASES A-1. The following paragraphs discuss various HR databases. These are used by HR professionals in performing HR missions. AUTOMATED MILITARY POSTAL SYSTEM A-2. The Automated Military Postal System is a web-enabled management system that integrates and optimizes business processes across the USPS and the DOD. System users can view information on their desktops for their MPOs and make changes or corrections to information themselves. The Automated Military Postal System provides the deployed MPO with the capability to process Postal Service (PS) Form 2942 (Military Mail AV7), finance business, postal net alerts, product tracking services, and monitoring voting information. DEFENSE CASUALTY INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM A-3. The DCIPS is the DOD functional information system of record for all casualty and mortuary affairs information processes for the Army, Marines, Navy, and Air Force. The DCIPS enforces uniform casualty reporting and case management support to survivors to ensure they receive all benefits and entitlements. For deceased personnel, DCIPS provides mortuary affairs visibility and case management of casketed remains from the port of entry mortuary to the final resting place. For injured/ill personnel, DCIPS provides tracking of progress reports to provide designated family members with the status of their loved one. The DCIPS is the primary source of information when communicating with family members and provides a real-time worldwide capability so the entire case history is immediately available to all authorized users. A-4.The DCIPS consists of three main modules that support the creation of casualty reports by units to overarching casualty support for survivors by CMAOD.  DCIPS-Case Management – This module is the main repository of all casualty reports, Soldier demographic data, incident information, NOK and other interested persons, NOK notification tracking, benefits and entitlements tracking, funeral and interment information, funeral claim adjudication, casualty notification and assistance officer assignments, and management and tracking of missing Soldiers from past conflicts. Access to this module requires approval by CMAOD.  DCIPS-Casualty Report (DCIPS-CR) – This module is used to create initial and supplemental casualty reports on a continuing basis by designated HR casualty personnel. The DCIPS-CR collects basic information concerning a casualty and allows the ASCC to manage, verify, and then submit the report to CMAOD. The DCIPS-CR allows the verification of entered casualty information against the Army’s official personnel database and DCIPS-Case Management. Vetted Appendix A A-2 FM 1-0 25 August 2021 casualty reports become permanent casualty reports in DCIPS-Case Management. The ASCC commander determines who used DCIPS-CR. Access to DCIPS-CR requires approval by CMAOD.  DCIPS-Personnel Casualty Report (DCIPS-PCR) – This module is used primarily by units in a theater of operation that do not have, or need, continuing access to DCIPS-CR. Casualty reports created and submitted using DCIPS-PCR appear in DCIPS-CR for action and further review and processing. Casualty reports submitted using DCIPS-PCR are not viewable or retrievable by a DCIPS-PCR user. Units requiring multiple users to view casualty reports must coordinate with their higher HQ casualty-reporting element to gain access to DCIPS-CR.

TRUSTED ASSOCIATE SPONSORSHIP PROGRAM A-59. The Trusted Associate Sponsorship Program is a web-based tool used to gather information to verify eligibility for issuing CACs to CAAF. Contractors who must complete the CAC application can access the data from any computer providing the Trusted Agent or Trusted Agent Security Manager has issued them a system generated user name and password. This provides increased control in who may apply for a CAC, eliminate data re-entry, and provide real-time information about CAAF. There is a distinction between contractors eligible for a CAC and others needing physical access when issuing local contractor ID cards. 25 August 2021 FM 1-0 Source Notes-1 Source Notes This division lists sources by page number.

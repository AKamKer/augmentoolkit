This publication supersedes FM 6-0, Commander and Staff Organization and Operations, May 2014. To comprehend this doctrine, the reader must first understand the nature of operations as described in ADP 3-0, Operations; the principles of C2 as described in ADP 6-0, Mission Command: Command and Control of Army Forces; and the fundamentals of the operations process found in ADP 5-0, The Operations Process. The principal audience for FM 6-0 includes Army commanders, leaders, and unit staffs (including officers, noncommissioned officers, and Soldiers). Commanders and staffs of Army headquarters serving as a joint headquarters or multinational headquarters should also refer to applicable joint or multinational doctrine concerning the range of military operations and the employment of joint or multinational forces. Trainers and educators throughout the Army will also use this publication. Commanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure their decisions and actions comply with applicable United States, international, and in some cases, host-nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels ensure their Soldiers operate in accordance with the law of war and the rules of engagement. (See FM 6-27 for more information on the law of land warfare.) FM 6-0 uses joint terms where necessary. Selected joint and Army terms and definitions appear in both the glossary and the text. Terms for which FM 6-0 is the proponent publication (the authority) are presented in italics and bold font in the text and marked with an asterisk (*) in the glossary. When first defined in the text, a term for which FM 6-0 is the proponent publication is boldfaced and italicized, and the definition is boldfaced. When first defining other proponent definitions in the text, the term is italicized and the number of the proponent publication follows the definition. FM 6-0 applies to the Active Army, the Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States, and the United States Army Reserve unless otherwise stated. The proponent of FM 6-0 is the United States Army Combined Arms Center. The preparing agency is the Combined Arms Doctrine Directorate, United States Army Combined Arms Center.

This page intentionally left blank. 0D\ FM 6-0 vii Introduction Command and control (C2)—the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces—is fundamental to the art and science of warfare. No single specialized military function, either by itself or combined with others, has a purpose without it. Commanders are responsible for C2. Through C2, commanders provide purpose and direction to integrate all military activities towards a common goal—mission accomplishment. Commanders need support to exercise C2 effectively. At every echelon of command, each commander establishes a C2 system—the arrangement of people, processes, networks, and command posts that enable commanders to conduct operations. The C2 system supports the commander’s decision making, disseminates the commander’s decisions to subordinates, and facilitates controlling forces. Commanders employ their C2 system to enable the people and formations conducting operations to work towards a common purpose. All the equipment and procedures exist to achieve this end. Commanders organize the four components of their C2 system to support decision making and facilitate communications. FM 6-0 aims to serve several purposes. First, it provides commanders and staffs with many of the tactics and procedures associated with establishing their C2 systems. In conjunction with FM 5-0, Planning and Orders Production, FM 6-0 provides detailed information on the people, processes, networks, and command posts that assists commanders in exercising C2. Second, this manual provides multiple templates and examples of products that commanders and staffs routinely use in the conduct of operations. It should be noted that commanders may modify products as necessary to meet mission requirements. Local standard operating procedures may also provide examples of products more suitable to specific situations. This version of FM 6-0 includes key updates and changes. It— z Nests with the C2 doctrine in ADP 6-0.
z Uses the components of the C2 system as a guide. z Moves all information related to planning and orders production to FM 5-0.
z Adds a section on command post organization and operations. z Adds an appendix on foreign disclosure. z Adds an appendix on after action reports. FM 6-0 contains nine chapters and six appendixes. The following is a brief introduction by chapter and appendix.Chapter 1 provides an overview of C2, mission command, the C2 warfighting function, and its associated tasks and system. Chapter 2 describes staff duties, responsibilities, and characteristics as part of the people component of the C2 system. It also explains staff relationships and the importance of building staff teams. Chapter 3 provides information on roles and responsibilities of liaison officers and liaison teams. It includes liaison checklists and an example outline for a liaison officer handbook. Chapter 4 addresses the unit’s battle rhythm, including responsibilities, development, and approval. It then provides descriptions and templates for the typical meetings, boards, and working groups that take place in a command post. Chapter 5 focuses on the conduct of knowledge management and information management. It presents a model used to explain the progression of data to understanding. The chapter describes the specifics of knowledge management followed by a discussion on information management and the interrelationship between knowledge management and information management. Introduction viii FM 6-0 0D\ Chapter 6 provides information about network communications capabilities and systems typically found in a command post, descriptions of the current information systems used in the development of the common operational picture, and considerations for command post communications. Chapter 7 describes the common functions of all command posts and discusses the types of command posts by echelon and unit. It provides considerations for effective command post organization and employment. Chapter 8 describes how to organize the staff into command post cells and techniques for the physical layout of a command post to facilitate effective command post operations. Chapter 9 describes command post operations, including discussions on developing standard operating procedures, command post security and defense, and life support for command post personnel and equipment. Appendix A provides information, instruction, and an annotated example of how to prepare and write a formal report in the form of a staff study and information on how to prepare and write a decision paper. Appendix B provides information, instruction, and annotated examples of how to prepare and conduct the four types of military briefings. Appendix C describes types of rehearsals, lists responsibilities of personnel involved, and contains guidelines for conducting rehearsals. Appendix D provides information on foreign disclosure. Appendix E describes the purpose and characteristics of command post battle drills, including a technique used to develop battle drills and templates for documenting them. Appendix F provides information on the after action report. FM 6-0 identifies the new and modified terms in the introductory table. Introductory table.

It addresses C2, mission command, and the C2 warfighting function and its associated tasks and system. COMMAND AND CONTROL 1-1. C2 is fundamental to the art and science of warfare. No single activity in operations is more important than C2. By itself, C2 will not secure an objective, destroy an enemy target, or deliver supplies. However, none of these activities could be coordinated towards a common objective, or synchronized to achieve maximum effect, without effective C2. It is through the countless activities of C2 that a military force implements to perform, gain purpose, and find direction. The goal of C2 is mission accomplishment. 1-2. Command is the authoritative act of making decisions and ordering action, while control is the act of monitoring and influencing that action. Both are essential to all military operations. Together, command and control is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission (JP 1). 1-3. Commanders are the focal point of C2; they must assess situations, make decisions, and direct action. They provide purpose, direction, and motivation to instill the will to win. Commanders seek to understand the situation, visualize the operational approach and end state, and describe these in their commander’s intent and planning guidance. During execution, commanders direct the actions of subordinates and adjust operations based on changes to the situation and feedback from subordinate units, external organizations, and their staffs. Commanders directly influence operations by their actions and personal presence. COMMAND 1-4. Commanders make decisions and order action through command. Command is the authority that a commander in the armed forces lawfully exercises over subordinates by virtue of rank or assignment (JP 1). Command resides with the commander and includes the authority and responsibility for effectively using available resources for planning the employment of, organizing, directing, coordinating, and controlling military forces for the accomplishment of missions. The key elements of command are— z Authority. z Responsibility. z Decision making. z Leadership. 1-5. Inherent in command is the authority that a military commander lawfully exercises over subordinates, including the authority to assign tasks and the responsibility for their successful completion. The authority to enforce orders by law is one of the key elements of command and distinguishes military commanders from other leaders and managers. 1-6. With authority comes responsibility. Commanders are legally and ethically responsible for their decisions and for the actions, accomplishments, and failures of their subordinates. Commanders may delegate authority, but delegation does not absolve commanders of their responsibility to the higher echelon commander. Commanders are always accountable for what happens or fails to happen in their command. 1-7. Commanders exercise their authority through decision making and leadership. Decision making refers to selecting a course of action as the one most favorable to accomplish the mission, and it includes making Chapter 1 1-2 FM 6-0 0D\ adjustments to plans during the execution of an operation. Decision making includes knowing whether to decide or not, when and what to decide, and understanding and accepting risk. Commanders use understanding, visualization, description, and direction to make and communicate their decisions. Commanders rely on their education, experience, knowledge, and judgment in applying authority as they decide (plan how to achieve the end state) and lead (direct their forces during preparation and execution) all while assessing progress. 1-8. Leadership refers to influencing people by providing purpose, direction, and motivation, while operating to accomplish the mission and improve the organization. It is the unifying and multiplying element of combat power. Commanders lead through a combination of personal example, persuasion, and compulsion. Commanders employ leadership to translate decisions into effective action by forces. For more information on command authority and responsibilities of the commander, see AR 600-20. CONTROL 1-9. The commander uses control to monitor and influence actions they ordered. Control is the regulation of forces and warfighting functions to accomplish the mission in accordance with the commander’s intent (ADP 6-0). Commanders exercise control over all forces in their area of operations, aided by their C2 system. Staffs aid the commander in exercising control by supporting the commander’s decision making; assisting subordinate commanders, staffs, and units; and keeping units and organizations outside the headquarters informed. Key components of control include— z Direction. z Feedback. z Information. z Communications. 1-10. Commanders, assisted by their staffs, direct the actions of their subordinates within their commander’s intent, the unit’s mission, and the concept of operations. Commanders provide direction and communicate information, usually in plans and orders that provide subordinate forces tasks and instruct them how to cooperate within a broader concept of operations. In the process, commanders receive feedback from subordinates and others so commanders can update their visualization and modify plans. This feedback creates a reciprocal flow of information that leads to a shared understanding among all participants. 1-11. Feedback is information commanders receive during operations. Commanders use feedback to compare the actual situation with the plan and then decide if the plan requires any changes or adjustments. Feedback takes many forms, including information, knowledge, experience, and wisdom. Feedback comes from many sources: subordinates, higher headquarters, or adjacent, supporting, and supported forces. It arrives continuously: before, during, or after operations. This helps commanders and subordinates gain shared understanding. 1-12. Central to providing direction and receiving feedback is information. The amount of information that is available makes managing information and turning it into effective decisions and actions critical to success during operations. Commanders and staffs employ knowledge management techniques to add clarity to information, speed its dissemination, and support situational understanding and decision making. 1-13. Commanders receive and communicate information to build shared understanding and to direct, coordinate, and synchronize the actions of subordinate units. Commander’s intent, orders, control measures, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) all assist with the control of operations. Determining the appropriate level of control in a particular situation is a critical command responsibility. 1-14. Commanders and staffs disseminate information among people, elements, and places. Communication is more than mere transmission of information. It is an activity that allows commanders, subordinates, and unified action partners to create shared understanding that supports action. It is a means to exercise control over forces. Communication links information to decisions and decisions to action. Communication among the parts of a command enables their coordinated action. Command and Control Overview 0D\ FM 6-0 1-3 MISSION COMMAND 1-15. Mission command helps commanders employ subordinates to achieve the commander’s intent in changing conditions. Mission command is the Army’s approach to command and control that empowers subordinate decision making and decentralized execution appropriate to the situation (ADP 6-0). Mission command supports the Army’s operational concept and its emphasis on seizing, retaining, and exploiting the initiative. 1-16. The mission command approach to C2 is based on the Army’s view that most plans change rapidly during execution to account for changes in the situation. No commander is ever sufficiently informed to make every decision, nor can the commander make all the decisions that need to be made in every instance during combat. Commanders have to rely on subordinates to carry out their commander’s intent. Subordinate leaders often have a better understanding and are better poised to make decisions at their level during a battle. Successful mission command is enabled by the principles of— z Competence. z Mutual trust. z Shared understanding. z Commander’s intent. z Mission orders. z Disciplined initiative. z Risk acceptance. 1-17. Subordinate leaders are more likely to respond effectively to threats and opportunities if allowed to make decisions and act based on changing and unforeseen situations to achieve their commander’s intent. Enemy forces may behave differently from expected, a route may become impassable, or units could consume supplies at unexpected rates. Friction and unforeseeable combinations of variables impose uncertainty in all operations and require an approach to C2 that does not attempt to impose perfect order, but rather accepts uncertainty and makes allowances for unpredictability. 1-18. Mission command helps commanders capitalize on their subordinates’ ingenuity, innovation, and decision making to achieve the commander’s intent when conditions change or current orders are no longer relevant. It requires subordinates who seek opportunities and commanders who accept risk for subordinates trying to meet their intent. Subordinate decision making and decentralized execution appropriate to the situation help manage uncertainty and enable a necessary tempo at each echelon during operations. (See ADP 6-0 for more discussion on mission command.) COMMAND AND CONTROL WARFIGHTING FUNCTION 1-19. Commanders use warfighting functions to generate combat power. A warfighting function is a group of tasks and systems united by a common purpose that commanders use to accomplish missions and training objectives (ADP 3-0). Warfighting functions are the physical means that tactical commanders use to execute operations and accomplish missions assigned by superior tactical and operational level commanders. 1-20. The command and control warfighting function is the related tasks and a system that enable commanders to synchronize and converge all elements of combat power (ADP 3-0). The primary purpose of the C2 warfighting function is to assist commanders in integrating the other elements of combat power (leadership, information, movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and protection) to achieve objectives and accomplish missions. The C2 warfighting function consists of the C2 warfighting function tasks and the C2 system depicted in figure 1-1 on page 1-4. 1-21. The C2 warfighting function tasks focus on integrating the activities of the other elements of combat power to accomplish missions. Commanders, assisted by their staffs, integrate numerous processes and activities within the headquarters and across the force through the C2 warfighting function. These tasks are described in ADP 6-0: z Command forces. z Control operations. Chapter 1 1-4 FM 6-0 0D\ z Drive the operations process. z Establish the C2 system. Figure 1-1. Command and control warfighting function COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM 1-22. Commanders cannot exercise C2 alone. Even at the lowest levels, commanders need support to exercise C2. At every echelon of command, each commander has a C2 system to provide that support. The command and control system is the arrangement of people, processes, networks, and command posts that enable commanders to conduct operations (ADP 6-0). 1-23. The C2 system consists of all the resources used to support C2 and enhances the commander’s ability to conduct operations. Commanders organize a C2 system to— z Support the commander’s decision making. z Collect, create, and maintain relevant information and prepare products to support the commander’s and leaders’ understanding and visualization. z Prepare and communicate directives. 1-24. To provide these three overlapping functions, commanders must effectively locate, design and organize the four components of their C2 system: people, processes, networks, and command posts (CPs) as depicted in figure 1-2. Figure 1-2. Components of a command and control system PEOPLE 1-25. The most important component of the C2 system is people—those who assist commanders and exercise control on their behalf. An effective C2 system accounts for the characteristics and limits of human nature. Simultaneously, it exploits and enhances uniquely human skills. People dedicated to the C2 system include commanders, seconds in command, command sergeants major, staffs, and liaison officers. Command and Control Overview 0D\ FM 6-0 1-5 Commanders 1-26. The place and time the commander resides in the area of operations are important considerations for effective C2. No standard pattern or simple prescription exists for command presence; different commanders lead differently. Commanders consider their position in relation to the forces they command and the mission. Their location can have important consequences, not only for the command but also for executing operations. The C2 system helps commanders position themselves forward without losing access to the information and analysis available from their CPs. Commanders balance their time among the CP and staff, subordinate commanders, forces, and other organizations to make the greatest contribution to success. 1-27. CPs serve as the focus for information exchange, planning, and analysis. They provide commanders direct access to the staff and allow them to communicate with superior, subordinate, and supporting commanders. While at a CP, commanders provide vital face-to-face guidance to staff members when developing plans and controlling operations. By moving to the locations of subordinates or to critical points in an area of operations, commanders can better access and influence the state of operations. They can personally gauge the condition of their units and leaders and consult directly with subordinate commanders performing critical tasks. By being forward, commanders can also motivate subordinates through personal example. 1-28. Where a commander is located can bring the leadership element of combat power directly to an operation, especially when that location allows for personal presence and the ability to directly observe events and see things that the C2 system might not convey.Being physically present can allow a commander to assess a much broader set of indicators of the unit’s condition. Commanders gain first-hand appreciation for the human aspects of a situation that can rarely be gained any other way. Equally important, commanders can actually see terrain and weather conditions that maps or reports might not clearly describe. Commanders can avoid the delays and distortions that occur as information travels down and up the chain of command. Finally, by their presence, commanders direct emphasis to critical spots and focus efforts on them. Some of the factors that influence a commander’s location include— z The need to understand the situation. z The need to make decisions. z The need to communicate. z The need to motivate subordinates. Seconds in Command 1-29. At all levels, the second in command is the commander’s principal assistant. The second in command may be a deputy commander, an assistant commander, or the executive officer. Commanders determine the duties and responsibilities of their deputy and assistant commanders. These duties and responsibilities are formally declared and outlined in a memorandum or SOP signed by the commander. Usually, at company through brigade echelons, the executive officer is the second in command. In a theater army, corps, or division, the deputy or assistant commander extends the commander’s span of control in areas and functions that the commander designates. 1-30. In organizations with more than one deputy or assistant, the commander designates which one is the second in command. Delegating authority to the seconds in command reduces the burden on commanders and allows them to focus on particular areas or concerns while their seconds in command concentrate on others. Normally, commanders delegate authority to seconds in command to act in their name for specific functions and responsibilities. Command Sergeants Major 1-31. The command sergeant major (CSM) is the senior noncommissioned officer of the command at battalion and higher levels. The CSM’s role in both mentoring subordinate organizations and staffs is critical, as they provide the expertise, present the experience, and instill morale. A CSM assists the commander in assessing, leading, and directing. The commander drives the operations process, and the CSM drives the force by transmitting and translating the commander’s intent and inspiring Soldiers. The CSM transmits the commander’s intent across the formation (down and across), translates the intent so that every member of the team can understand, and inspires the formation to achieve mission success. Chapter 1 1-6 FM 6-0 0D\ 1-32. CSMs carry out policies and enforce standards for the performance, individual training, and conduct of enlisted Soldiers. They give advice and initiate recommendations to commanders and staffs in matters pertaining to enlisted Soldiers. CSMs administer the unit noncommissioned officer’s development program. In operations, commanders employ their CSMs throughout the area of operations to extend command influence, assess morale of the force, and assist during critical events. Company first sergeants and platoon sergeants perform similar functions at company and platoon levels. Staffs 1-33. Staffs support commanders in making and implementing decisions and in integrating and synchronizing combat power. Effective staffs multiply a unit’s effectiveness. They provide timely and relevant information and analysis, make estimates and recommendations, prepare plans and orders, assist in controlling operations, and assess the progress of operations for the commander. Primary responsibilities of any staffs are to— z Support the commander. z Assist subordinate commanders, staffs, and units. z Inform units and organizations outside the headquarters. (See Chapter 2 for information on the staff.) Liaison Officers 1-34. Liaison is that contact or intercommunication maintained between elements of military forces or other agencies to ensure mutual understanding and unity of purpose and action. Most commonly used for establishing and maintaining close communications, liaison continuously enables direct, physical communications between commands and with unified action partners. Commanders use liaison during operations and normal daily activities to facilitate a shared understanding and purpose among organizations, preserve freedom of action, and maintain flexibility. Liaison provides commanders with relevant information and answers to operational questions, thus enhancing the commander’s situational understanding. 1-35. Liaison activities augment the commanders’ ability to synchronize and converge all elements of combat power into their concept of operations and scheme of maneuver. These activities include establishing and maintaining physical contact and communications between elements of military forces and nonmilitary agencies during operations. Liaison activities ensure— z Cooperation and understanding among commanders and staffs of different headquarters. z Coordination on tactical matters to achieve unity of effort. z Synchronization of lethal and nonlethal effects. z Understanding of implied or inferred coordination measures to achieve synchronized results. 1-36. A liaison officer represents a commander or staff officer. Liaison officers transmit information directly, bypassing headquarters and staff layers. A trained, competent, trusted, and informed liaison officer, either a commissioned or a noncommissioned officer, is the key to effective liaison. Liaison officers must have the commander’s full confidence and sufficient experience for the mission. At higher echelons, the complexity of operations often requires more senior ranking liaison officers. See Chapter 3 for additional information on liaisons. PROCESSES 1-37. Commanders establish and use systematic processes and procedures to organize the activities within their headquarters and throughout the force. Processes are a series of actions directed to an end state, such as the operations process and integrating processes. 1-38. The Army’s framework for organizing and putting command and control into action is the operations process—the major command and control activities performed during operations: planning, preparing, executing, and continuously assessing the operation (ADP 5-0). Commanders use the operations process to drive the conceptual and detailed planning necessary to understand an operational environment (known as OE); visualize and describe the operation’s end state and operational approach; make and articulate decisions; and direct, lead, and assess operations as shown in figure 1-3. Command and Control Overview 0D\ FM 6-0 1-7 Figure 1-3. The operations process 1-39. In addition to the operations process, commanders and staffs use integrating processes to synchronize specific functions. Integrating processes consist of a number of steps and activities that integrate the warfighting functions by incorporating multiple disciplines to achieve a specific end. The integrating processes are— z Intelligence preparation of the battlefield (described in ATP 2-01.3). z Information collection (described in FM 3-55). z Targeting (described in ATP 3-60). z Risk management (described in ATP 5-19). z Knowledge management (described in Chapter 5). See ADP 5-0 and FM 5-0 for more information on the operations process and integrating processes. 1-40. Procedures are standard, detailed steps that prescribe how to perform specific tasks (CJCSM 5120.01B). Procedures govern actions within the C2 system to make it more effective and efficient. For example, SOPs often provide detailed unit instructions on how to configure common operational picture (known as COP) displays. Adhering to processes and procedures minimizes confusion, misunderstanding, and hesitation as commanders frequently make rapid decisions to meet operational requirements. 1-41. C2 procedures are designed for simplicity and speed: they should be simple enough to perform quickly and smoothly under conditions of extreme stress. They should be efficient enough to increase tempo. Streamlined staff-planning sequences are preferable to deliberate or elaborate ones. 1-42. Commanders establish procedures to streamline operations and written orders and help integrate new Soldiers and attachments. Usually explained in unit SOPs, procedures help commanders make decisions faster by providing relevant information in standard, easy-to-understand formats. Procedures describe routine actions, thus eliminating repetitive decisions, such as where to put people in a CP, how to set up a CP, and march formations. Procedures do not cover every possible situation. Units avoid applying procedures blindly to the wrong tasks or the wrong situations, which can lead to ineffective, even counterproductive, performance. Chapter 1 1-8 FM 6-0 0D\ 1-43. Commanders establish a battle rhythm as a procedural way to organize the activities within their headquarters and throughout the force. As a deliberate daily cycle of command, staff, and unit activities, battle rhythm intends to synchronize current and future operations. A headquarters’ battle rhythm consists of a series of meetings (including working groups and boards), briefings, and other activities synchronized by time and purpose. (See Chapter 4 for discussion on battle rhythm.) NETWORKS 1-44. Generally, a network is a grouping of things that are interconnected to collect, process, store, display, disseminate, and protect information worldwide. Networks enable commanders to communicate information and control forces whether mounted or dismounted. Networks are key enablers to successful operations. 1-45. Commanders determine their information requirements and focus their staffs and organizations on using the network to meet these requirements in the most simple and efficient manner possible. These network capabilities relieve the staff of handling routine data and enable extensive information sharing, collaborative planning, execution, and assessment that promote shared understanding. The network consists of— z End-user applications. z Information services and data. z Network transport and management. (See Chapter 6 for more discussion on networks and CP communications.) COMMAND POSTS 1-46. Effective C2 requires continuous, and often immediate, close coordination, synchronization, and information sharing across the staff. To promote this, commanders organize their staffs and other components of the C2 system into CPs to assist them in effectively conducting operations. CPs provide a physical location for people, processes, and networks to directly assist commanders in understanding, visualizing, describing, directing, leading, and assessing operations. 1-47. CPs vary in size, complexity, and focus, such as the main CP or the tactical CP. They may be composed of vehicles, containers, and tents, or they may be located in buildings. Commanders systematically arrange platforms, operation centers, signal nodes, and support equipment in ways best suited for a particular operational environment. Examples of equipment needed to sustain a C2 system include vehicles, radio or signal equipment, generators, and lighting. Functions common to all CPs include— z Conducting knowledge management and information management. (See Chapter 5 for more information.) z Building and maintaining situational understanding. z Maintaining running estimates in support of the commander’s decision making. z Controlling operations. z Assessing operations. z Coordinating with internal and external organizations. z Performing CP administration. (See Chapter 7, Chapter 8, and Chapter 9 for a detailed discussion of CPs. See Appendix E for a discussion of procedures associated with running a CP.) MULTINATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 1-48. Multinational operations consist of military actions conducted by forces of two or more nations, undertaken within the structure of a coalition or alliance. When an Army headquarters serves as a multinational headquarters, commanders have additional considerations for establishing the command and control system. The staff must tailor and configure the headquarters to accommodate the different people, processes, networks, and command posts required to execute the operation. Some considerations include— z Command structure. z Staffing. Command and Control Overview 0D\ FM 6-0 1-9 z Liaisons and coordination. z Communications. z Translators and interpreters. z Multinational information sharing. (For more information on considerations for establishing, organizing, and operating multinational headquarters, see Chapter 7.) CONCLUSION 1-49. Commanders cannot exercise C2 alone. Even at the lowest level, commanders need support to exercise C2 effectively. At every echelon of command, each commander has a C2 system. Commanders arrange people, processes, and networks into CPs to best facilitate their exercise of authority and direction.

The chapter then describes staff organization and considerations for effectively organizing staffs. The chapter concludes by describing the duties and functions of coordinating, special, and personal staff officers by area of expertise. PURPOSE OF STAFFS 2-1. Staffs support commanders in making and implementing decisions and in integrating and synchronizing combat power. Competent staffs multiply a unit’s effectiveness. They provide timely and relevant information and analysis, make estimates and recommendations, prepare plans and orders, assist in controlling operations, and assess the progress of operations for the commander. The primary responsibilities of staffs are to— z Support the commander. z Assist subordinate commanders, staffs, and units. z Inform units and organizations outside the headquarters. SUPPORT THE COMMANDER 2-2. Staff activities focus on assisting the commander in accomplishing the mission. Staffs support commanders in understanding, visualizing, and describing an operational environment (OE); making and articulating timely decisions; and directing, leading, and assessing military operations. They make recommendations and prepare plans and orders for their commander. Staff products consist of timely and relevant information and analysis, such as that found in the running estimates. Staffs use knowledge management to extract that information from the vast amount of available information. Staffs synthesize this information and provide it to commanders as running estimates to help commanders build and maintain their situational understanding. 2-3. Staffs also prepare and disseminate information to subordinates for execution to assist commanders in controlling operations. While commanders should personally disseminate their commander’s intent and planning guidance, they rely on their staffs to communicate the majority of their guidance as plans and orders. Staffs must communicate their commander’s decisions, and the intentions behind them, efficiently and effectively throughout the force. 2-4. Staffs support and advise their commander within their area of expertise. While commanders make key decisions, they are not the only decision makers. Trained and trusted staff members, given decision- making authority based on the commander’s intent, free commanders from routine decisions. This enables commanders to focus on key aspects of operations. ASSIST SUBORDINATE COMMANDERS, STAFFS, AND UNITS 2-5. Effective staffs establish and maintain a high degree of coordination and cooperation with staffs of their subordinate echelons. Staffs help subordinate headquarters understand the larger context of operations. They do this by first understanding their higher echelon headquarters’ operations and commander’s intent, as well as nesting their unit’s operations with their higher headquarters. They then actively collaborate with subordinate commanders and staffs to facilitate a shared understanding of an OE. Examples of staffs assisting subordinate units include performing staff coordination, staff assistance visits, and staff inspections. Chapter 2 2-2 FM 6-0 0D\ INFORM UNITS AND ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE THE HEADQUARTERS 2-6. Staffs keep units outside their own headquarters well informed. Staffs also keep civilian organizations informed with relevant information according to their security classifications and their need to know. Staffs have an obligation to establish mutual working relationships with their counterparts in other organizations. As soon as a staff receives information and determines its relevancy, that staff passes that information to the appropriate headquarters. The key is relevance, not volume. Large amounts of data may distract staffs from relevant information. Effective knowledge management helps staffs identify the information commanders and staff elements need and its relative importance. 2-7. Information should reach recipients based on their need for it. Sending incomplete information sooner is better than sending complete information too late to matter. When forwarding information, the sending staff highlights key information for each recipient and clarifies the commander’s intent. Highlighting and clarification assists receivers in analyzing the content of the information received to determine that information’s particular importance to the higher and subordinate commanders. The sending staff may pass information directly, include its analysis, or add context to it. Common, distributed databases can accelerate this function; however, they cannot replace the personal contact that adds perspective. COMMON STAFF DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2-8. Staff members have specific duties and responsibilities associated with their area of expertise. They must be ready to advise the commander and other senior leaders regarding issues pertaining to their areas of expertise without advance notice.However, regardless of their career field or duty billet, all staff sections share a common set of duties and responsibilities: z Managing information within their area of expertise. z Building and maintaining running estimates. z Conducting staff research and analyzing problems. z Performing intelligence preparation of the battlefield. z Developing information requirements. z Advising and informing the commander. z Providing recommendations. z Preparing plans, orders, and other staff writing. z Exercising staff supervision. z Performing risk management. z Assessing operations. z Conducting staff inspections and assistance visits. z Performing staff administrative procedures. MANAGING INFORMATION WITHIN THEIR AREAS OF EXPERTISE 2-9. Staff members manage information related to their individual area of expertise. Staff members are not merely data collectors and transmitters. They analyze and clearly articulate information. Staffs collect, process, store, display, and disseminate information that flows continuously into their headquarters. They provide answers to the commander’s critical information requirements (known as CCIRs) as quickly as possible. 2-10. Staff members routinely analyze factors influencing operations. They seek to identify problems affecting their area of expertise or the entire command. Judgment and experience are major factors in recognizing problems. Staff members use their judgment to follow a systematic approach, weighing each new item of information in relation to other available information. Staff sections may follow information management processes specific to their area of expertise or warfighting function. The intelligence process is an example of such a process. Staff Organization and Roles 0D\ FM 6-0 2-3 2-11. Staff members disseminate information using, among other media, briefings, electronic mail, staff papers, reports, and summaries. They use reports and summaries extensively to provide information to higher echelon, subordinate, supporting, supported, and adjacent commands. Staffs request the minimum number of reports from subordinates consistent with the commander’s need for information. (See Appendix A for writing staff studies and decision papers.) BUILDING AND MAINTAINING RUNNING ESTIMATES 2-12. Staff sections prepare and maintain running estimates to help commanders make decisions. Effective plans and successful execution hinge on the currency and relevancy of information in running estimates. Running estimates need to include analyzed information that pertains to the operation and is of value to the commander, not raw data. Facts and figures need to contain information on how they will affect the operation. 2-13. Running estimates always include recommendations for anticipated decisions. During planning, commanders use these recommendations to select courses of action (COAs) for further analysis. During preparation and execution, commanders use recommendations from running estimates in decision making. Failure to maintain running estimates may lead to errors or omissions that result in flawed plans or bad decisions. (See FM 5-0 for more information on running estimates to include format.) CONDUCTING STAFF RESEARCH AND ANALYZING PROBLEMS 2-14. Staff research involves collecting and evaluating facts to solve problems or provide information. The problem determines the extent of research. Staffs continually identify current and potential problems or issues that could affect mission accomplishment. Once they identify a problem, staff members analyze the actions or coordination needed to solve it and seek assistance as needed. Only after analyzing a problem and listing the main factors to consider can staff members determine how much and what kind of research to conduct and what kind of information to collect. 2-15. Staff members decide when they have enough research and information to draw valid conclusions. Valid conclusions are relevant to the topic and objective as well as supported by data. They arrive at them through a logical thought process. Staff members may have the ability and authority to solve the problem without involving the commander. If not, they analyze the problem and make a recommendation to the commander for decision. (See FM 5-0 on more information about problem solving.) PERFORMING INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE BATTLEFIELD 2-16. Intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) is a continuous staff planning activity undertaken by the entire staff. Intelligence preparation of the battlefield is the systematic process of analyzing the mission variables of enemy, terrain, weather, and civil considerations in an area of interest to determine their effect on operations (ATP 2-01.3). Although the G-2 or S-2 leads the IPB, various staff sections contribute to it. During this task, the intelligence staff creates data files on specific OEs based on an evaluation of the information and intelligence related to the operational variables identified. The staff aims to understand the OE and the options it presents to friendly and threat forces. (See ATP 2-01.3 for more information on IPB.) DEVELOPING INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS 2-17. Information requirements development involves identifying, prioritizing, and refining uncertainties about the threat and significant aspects of an OE that must be resolved to accomplish the mission. The entire staff will develop their own information requirements based on their analysis. Commanders then base their initial information requirements on the critical gaps identified by the staff during IPB in the mission analysis step of the military decision-making process (known as MDMP). 2-18. The staff then codifies information requirements into an information collection plan. The information collection plan prioritizes reconnaissance, surveillance, and intelligence collection assets so staffs collect information that satisfies the identified requirements. Continual assessments and updates to IPB products from the information collected will then enable commanders and staffs to develop a realistic and sufficiently flexible plan to account for enemy objectives, COAs, and capabilities. This collected information will also assist commanders and staffs in identifying warning intelligence. Such intelligence indicates changes in the Chapter 2 2-4 FM 6-0 0D\ likelihood of threat actions against friendly forces or developments likely to cause harm to friendly forces— whether in support of defensive or offensive operations. (For more information on developing information requirements, see ATP 2-01.) ADVISING AND INFORMING THE COMMANDER 2-19. Staffs continuously provide relevant information to their commanders on the progress of operations. This information helps commanders achieve situational understanding. One piece of information alone may not be significant; however, when combined with other information from the common operational picture (COP), it may allow the commander to formulate an accurate commander’s visualization and make an appropriate decision. Staff members inform and advise the commander and other staff members concerning all matters pertaining to their individual areas of expertise and related functional responsibilities, specifically on— z Capabilities, limitations, requirements, availability, and employment of resources. z Capabilities, limitations, and employment of supporting forces. z Directives and policy guidance from higher echelon headquarters. z Changes to the situation that require decisions or updated commander’s critical information requirements. PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS 2-20. Another form of advising the commander is through recommendations. Staff members provide recommendations to help commanders make decisions and establish policies. They also offer recommendations to each other and subordinate commanders. Staff members prepare recommendations in a form that requires only the commander’s approval or disapproval. Some of the examples of staff recommendations are— z Command policy. z Guidance concerning force capabilities, limitations, and employment. z Policies and procedures to enhance force capabilities. z Priorities for employment, distribution, and support. z Acceptable risk. z Organization for operations, resource allocations, and command and support relationships. z Resource allocation and employment synchronization of all organic and supporting assets. PREPARING PLANS, ORDERS, AND OTHER STAFF WRITING 2-21. Staffs prepare and issue plans and orders to execute their commanders’ decisions, coordinating all necessary details. Commanders may delegate authority to certain staff officers to issue plans and orders without their personal approval. Commanders assign a single staff officer responsibility for authenticating and publishing plans and orders. Other staff members prepare portions of plans and orders that address their area of expertise. Examples include— z Formulating the concepts of operations and support in accordance with the commander’s intent. z Identifying specified and implied tasks. z Adjusting plans and orders based on feedback. z Identifying constraints. Staff members make similar contributions to standard operating procedures (SOPs), training plans, reports, studies, and summaries. (See FM 5-0 for more information on planning to include formats for plans and orders.) EXERCISING STAFF SUPERVISION 2-22. Staff supervision involves overseeing operations within individual areas of expertise and supervising staff sections and their personnel. Staff sections exercise oversight by performing tasks that affect their individual areas of expertise. These tasks include— Staff Organization and Roles 0D\ FM 6-0 2-5 z Performing staff supervision of activities and units assigned, attached, or under the operational control of the command to ensure adequate support of the command. z Monitoring the maintenance, personnel, and equipment status as well as advising the commander and responsible coordinating staff officer on these items. z Organizing and supervising subelements. 2-23. Staff section leaders supervise their personnel. Supervision includes— z Recommending and coordinating assignments and personnel issues. z Coordinating procurement, storage, issue, and distribution of section equipment. z Conducting section training. PERFORMING RISK MANAGEMENT 2-24. Every staff member integrates risk management into the conduct (planning, preparing, executing, and assessing) of training and operations. Staff members help their commander minimize unnecessary risk by assessing hazards within their areas of expertise and recommending controls to reduce or eliminate unnecessary risk. 2-25. The chief of protection—or the operations staff officer (S-3) in units without a protection cell—in coordination with the safety officer or safety manager integrates risk management into operations. In organizations with organic professional safety personnel, the safety officer or safety manager, as part of the commander’s personal staff, provides technical risk management expertise to the commander and staff. Organizations without organic safety personnel obtain this support from trained additional or collateral duty safety officers. (See ATP 5-19 for more information on risk management.) ASSESSING OPERATIONS 2-26. Staffs continually monitor and assess the execution of current operations. Continuous assessment keeps staffs informed of the situation and provides them with current relevant information. Staffs use this relevant information to maintain running estimates and produce progress reports for their commanders. Staff members ensure that the intended recipients receive the commander’s decisions as well as understand and execute them within the commander’s intent. They also recommend adjustments when circumstances require. Staffs assess by analyzing reports and messages and by conducting staff visits and inspections. Assessment actions by staff members include monitoring the execution of instructions, plans, and orders and ensuring subordinate and supporting units accomplish assigned tasks. (See FM 5-0 for more information on assessing operations to include building an assessment plan.) CONDUCTING STAFF INSPECTIONS AND ASSISTANCE VISITS 2-27. Commanders direct individual staff members or teams to conduct staff inspections and assistance visits. Commanders use inspections to determine certain conditions within a subordinate unit, such as compliance or conformity with policies and regulations. Inspectors note positive and negative observations. Before the inspection, inspectors inform the subordinate commander of the inspection’s purpose. Afterward, inspectors provide an informal report to the subordinate commander before they leave. Inspectors normally prepare a written report for their commander and furnish a copy to the inspected unit. 2-28. Staff members visit subordinate units for several reasons. These include gathering information for the commander, observing the execution of orders, and providing advice and assistance in their areas of expertise. Commanders may designate representatives to make these visits in their name. When visiting subordinate units, staff members call on the subordinate unit commander to explain the visit’s purpose. Before leaving, they report any findings to the subordinate commander and any information they plan to report. Staff members avoid interfering with the subordinate commander’s responsibilities. If the subordinate commander misunderstands the higher commander’s orders, staff members provide additional information and guidance to the subordinate commander or staff. When staff members return to the sending headquarters, they make a brief oral or written report to their staff principal, the chief of staff (COS), or the commander. The COS provides this report to other staff members. (For more information on staff inspections and assistance visits, see AR 1-201.) Chapter 2 2-6 FM 6-0 0D\ PERFORMING STAFF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES 2-29. Each staff member performs administrative procedures. Effective procedures provide continuity for completed staff actions and allow staff members and staff sections to perform tasks efficiently and effectively. Staff members manage administrative activities within their own staff sections. Examples include maintaining— z Policy files of the commander and higher headquarters. z Current command SOPs and, specifically, the internal SOP for the staff member’s area of expertise. z Staff section records, especially those providing relevant information to the commander. z Reference files. CHARACTERISTICS OF EFFECTIVE STAFF MEMBERS 2-30. The commander’s staff must function as a single, cohesive unit—a team. Effective staff members know their respective responsibilities and duties. They are also familiar with the responsibilities and duties of other staff members. Effective staff members understand how to communicate with their commander, and they can discern what information is vital to their commander’s ability to command and control. They seek a shared understanding of an OE with their commander and with the commanders of both higher echelon and subordinate headquarters. This shared understanding includes the commander’s visualization of the operational approach, including the commander’s intent. 2-31. In addition to the leader attributes and core competencies addressed in Army leadership doctrine, effective staff members— z Are competent. They are experts in doctrine and the processes and procedures associated with the operations process. They understand the duties of other staff members enough to accomplish coordination both vertically and horizontally. z Bring clarity. They help simplify problems in complex OEs by explaining the meaning of information and not simply providing raw data to the commander. z Exercise initiative. They anticipate requirements rather than waiting for instructions. They anticipate what the commander needs to accomplish the mission and prepare answers to potential questions before they are asked. z Apply critical and creative thinking. As critical thinkers, staff members discern truth in situations where direct observation is insufficient, impossible, or impractical. They determine whether adequate justification exists to accept conclusions as true, based on a given inference or argument. As creative thinkers, staff members look at different options to solve problems. They use innovative approaches by drawing from previous experience or developing new ideas. In both instances, staff members use creative thinking to apply imagination and depart from the old way of doing things when appropriate. (For more information on critical and creative thinking, see ADP 6-0 and ADP 5-0.) z Are adaptive. They recognize and adjust to changing conditions in an OE with appropriate, flexible, and timely actions. They rapidly adjust and continuously assess plans, tactics, techniques, and procedures as additional information becomes available. z Are flexible. They avoid becoming overwhelmed or frustrated by changing requirements and priorities. Commanders may change their minds or redirect their commands after receiving additional information or a new mission, and they may not inform their staffs of the reason for a change. Staff members remain flexible and adjust to any changes. They set priorities when there are more tasks to accomplish than time allows. They learn to manage multiple commitments simultaneously. z Possess discipline and self-confidence. They understand that all staff work serves the commander, even if the commander rejects the resulting recommendation. Staff members do not give a partial effort, even if they think the commander will disagree with their recommendations. Alternative and possibly unpopular ideas or points of view assist commanders in making the best possible decisions. Staff Organization and Roles 0D\ FM 6-0 2-7 z Are team players. They cooperate with other staff members within and outside their headquarters. This practice contributes to effective collaboration and coordination. STAFF RELATIONSHIPS 2-32. Staff effectiveness depends in part on relationships of the staff with commanders and other staffs. Collaboration aids in developing shared understanding and visualization among staffs at different echelons. A staff acts on behalf of, and derives its authority from, its commander. Although commanders are the principal decision makers, individual staff officers make decisions within their authority based on broad guidance and unit SOPs. Commanders insist on frank collaboration between themselves and their staff officers. A staff gives honest, independent thoughts and recommendations so commanders can make the best possible decisions. Once their commander makes a decision, staff officers support and implement the commander’s decision, even if the decision differs from their recommendations. 2-33. Teamwork within a staff and between staffs produces the staff integration essential to synchronized operations.A staff works efficiently with complete cooperation from all staff sections. In addition to being highly knowledgeable in their own fields, operations processes, and procedures, all staff members must be familiar with the duties and responsibilities of other staff sections so they can most effectively and efficiently coordinate and achieve results for the commander. A force operates effectively in cooperation with all headquarters. Commanders and staffs contribute to foster this positive climate during training and sustain it during operations. However, frequent personnel changes and augmentation to their headquarters adds challenges to building and maintaining a team. While all staff sections have clearly defined functional responsibilities, none can operate effectively in isolation. Therefore, coordination is extremely important. Commanders ensure staff sections are properly equipped and manned. This allows staffs to efficiently work within their headquarters and with their counterparts in other headquarters. Commanders ensure staff integration through developing the unit’s battle rhythm, including synchronizing various meetings, working groups, and boards. STAFF ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE 2-34. Mission requirements determine how commanders organize, tailor, or adapt their individual staffs. The mission also determines the size and composition of the staff. However, there are also authoritative documents that govern requirements, including staff sections, for each organization within the Army. 2-35. Staff organization varies according to echelon. Certain staff officer billets do not exist at the lower echelons, such as battalion and brigade, but may be part of the staff at division and higher levels of command. Staffs at every echelon and type of unit are structured differently; however, their structure is based on three considerations: z Mission. z Broad areas of expertise (functional responsibilities). z Regulations and laws. 2-36. Regardless of mission, every Army staff has common broad areas of expertise that determine how the commander divides duties and responsibilities. Areas of expertise may vary slightly, depending on the echelon of command, mission, and environment. For example, at the battalion echelon there is no resource manager, while certain sustainment units combine the intelligence and operations functions. Note. Noncommissioned officers (NCOs) serve alongside their staff officer counterparts in all staff sections. They execute similar duties as those of their staff officer. NCOs often provide the experience and continuity in their particular staff section. They provide expert advice to the principal staff officer and other members of the staff section. Staff NCOs display the same characteristics as effective staff officers. 2-37. The Department of the Army develops headquarters for a specific purpose and documents personnel and equipment requirements to operate that headquarters in a table of organization and equipment (TO&E). The TO&E is a standard authorization document that prescribes organizational structure, personnel, and Chapter 2 2-8 FM 6-0 0D\ equipment requirements of a military unit. Headquarters TO&Es authorize individual staff members by rank and specialty to specific staff elements within staff sections or command post (CP) cells. A TO&E does not account for administrative or garrison responsibilities, as it only resources the minimum wartime essential requirements for the unit. Army doctrine expands on this organization and describes the tactics and techniques for employing and operating each type of headquarters. 2-38. Commanders further establish personnel and equipment requirements by developing a modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) from the TO&E. In doing so, commanders prescribe in more detail the personnel and equipment required to accomplish missions in specific OEs or specific points on a modernization path. Commanders can change their individual MTOEs with Department of the Army approval. 2-39. A headquarters may also have a Table of Distribution and Allowance. The Table of Distribution and Allowance is commonly used to document installation commands and include Department of the Army Civilian positions. Types of Tables of Distribution and Allowance include mobilization, augmentation, and full-time support. 2-40. The unit MTOE and supporting doctrine provides the foundation commanders and staffs refer to when organizing their CPs for specific operations. Based on the situation or preference, commanders may adjust their organization to meet mission requirements. In organizing personnel into CPs for operations or training exercises, commanders, chiefs of staff or executive officers, and the staff consider the following: z Staff sections and elements. z CP cells. z Boards, working groups, and planning teams. z Augmentation. (See Chapter 7 for more information on command post organization.) TYPES OF STAFFS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS 2-41. The basic staff structure includes a COS or executive officer (XO) and various staff sections. The position is titled COS at division and above, but XO at brigade and battalion. A staff section is a grouping of staff members by area of expertise. There are three basic types of staff officers: coordinating, special, and personal. A principal staff officer—who may be a coordinating, special, or personal staff officer for the commander—leads each staff section. The duties and responsibilities inherent in an area of expertise are called functional responsibilities. Paragraphs 2-43 through 2-148 describe the functional responsibilities, to include contributions to the operation order (OPORD) or operation plan (OPLAN), for coordinating, special, and personal staff officers and sections, the specifics of which often vary by levels of command. (See figure 2-1 for basic staff structure.) Figure 2-1. Basic staff structure Staff Organization and Roles 0D\ FM 6-0 2-9 2-42. Figure 2-1 is a basic staff structure depicting the three types of staff officer groups and their relationship to the commander and the COS or XO. The rest of the chapter describes each staff officer group and list the principal staff officers in each group. CHIEF OF STAFF (OR EXECUTIVE OFFICER) 2-43. The COS or XO is the commander’s principal staff officer. Commanders normally delegate executive management authority to the COS or XO, who typically also has successful command experience at lower echelons. As the key staff integrator, the COS or XO frees the commander from routine details of staff operations and the management of the headquarters. The COS or XO ensures the staff pulls together as a team and has good ésprit de corps, making the headquarters feel more like a cohesive unit rather than a large, impersonal organization. The COS or XO ensures efficient and prompt staff actions. The COS or XO responsibilities include, but are not limited to— z Coordinating and directing the work of the staff. z Establishing and monitoring the headquarters battle rhythm and nesting it with higher echelon and subordinate headquarters battle rhythms for effective planning support, decision making, and other critical functions. z Representing the commander when authorized. z Ensuring effective liaison exchange with higher echelon, lower, and adjacent units and other organizations, as required. z Supervising the sustainment of the headquarters and activities of the headquarters and headquarters battalion or company. COORDINATING STAFF 2-44. Coordinating staff officers are the commander’s principal staff assistants who advise, plan, and coordinate actions of special staff officers within their area of expertise. They are directly accountable to the COS or XO and have functional responsibilities over one or a combination of fields of interest. Commanders may designate coordinating staff officers as assistant chiefs of staff, deputy chiefs of staff, chiefs of warfighting functions, directors, or regular staff officers. These positions generally reflect the degree of authority the commander delegates to them and the scope and complexity of operations conducted by the command. 2-45. Commanders establish a coordinating staff officer’s authority and responsibilities if they are not inherent in the position’s title. This can be done through orders and directives. Coordinating staff officers’ authority is usually limited to advising, planning, and coordinating actions within their individual fields of interest. Clearly defined staff responsibilities are necessary to facilitate coordination and eliminate conflict. Unit SOPs or organization and functions publications should contain procedures that specify primary responsibilities and coordination requirements. 2-46. Duties and responsibilities can vary by echelon. For example, most battalions and brigades are not authorized a separate plans section according to their MTOEs. Long-term planning functions are performed by the S-3.

This officer provides religious, moral, and ethical advisement to the commander as they impact both individuals and the organization’s mission.The chaplain coordinates with higher, subordinate, and adjacent unit ministry teams and chaplain sections for area and denominational coverage requirements. (See FM 1-05 for additional information on religious support, duties, tasks, and functions of the chaplain and unit ministry team.) 2-132. Chaplain sections and unit ministry teams can work in boards, bureaus, centers, cells, and working groups. They integrate their respective expertise and knowledge with the collective expertise of the staff to focus on specific problem sets to provide coherent staff recommendations to the commander. Chaplains ensure units offer religious support that meets the religious and spiritual requirements of the military culture. Religious support includes religious education, clergy counsel, pastoral care, authentic worship, and religious and spiritual expression to Soldiers during the varied circumstances of military contingencies. Chaplains advise the commander externally and internally. External advisement (see ATP 1-05.03) concerns the potential impact of religion and culture of local populations who are external to the unit in an AO. Internal advisement (see ATP 1-05.04) concerns the impact of religion, morals, and morale within units, and ethical decision making of the command. 2-133. Coordinated by the COS or XO, the chaplain section or unit ministry team, prepares Tab D (Religious Support) to Appendix 2 (Personnel Services Support) of Annex F (Sustainment). Chaplain responsibilities include, but are not limited to— z Providing for the religious needs and practices of Service members, Families, and authorized DA Civilians through religious worship, rites, sacraments, ordinances, religious education, and spiritual fitness events. z Providing pastoral and religious counseling and care for Service members, Families, and authorized DA Civilians in the areas of marriage and family, domestic violence, suicide ideation, traumatic event management, hospital visitation, and other crises that impact mission accomplishment. z Planning, preparing, and executing memorial events and funerals to honor Service members, Family members, authorized DA Civilians, and retirees.

Based on the situation and mission requirements, commanders may also receive or request augmentation (of individuals and teams) to assist them with command and control and to bridge capability gaps. For example, divisions commonly receive a civil affairs battalion when deployed. A civil affairs planning team within that battalion augments the civil affairs staff section and plans cell in the division headquarters. In other instances, commanders may request additional staff augmentation. Augmentation teams include, but are not limited to— z Army space support teams. z Army cyberspace operations support teams. z Civil affairs planning teams. z Combat camera teams. z Legal support teams. z Mobile public affairs detachments. z Military history detachments. z PSYOP units. z Army IO field support teams. z Individual augmentations by specialty (for example, language, economics, and assessment). z Chaplain detachments. Note. Sergeants major can be assigned as principle staff NCOs at various staff positions to augment the primary staff officer. They provide technical and tactical expertise, supervision, enforcement of battle rhythm, knowledge management, planning, processes, assigned SOPs, and mentorship of their respected staff section. Sergeants major are typically assigned at battalion level and above to ensure staff sections support the commander in mission accomplishment, assist subordinate staffs and units, and inform lateral and higher headquarters. Chapter 2 2-34 FM 6-0 0D\ CONCLUSION 2-148. Staff officers must be subject matter experts in their own fields, integrate as a member of the staff, and be flexible and able to anticipate and solve complex problems sets. They must anticipate problems and generate and preserve options for the commander to make timely decisions. They must be leaders. Based on available capabilities and resources, staff officers must also be able to receive, interpret, and implement the guidance from their higher headquarters. Likewise, they must support their subordinate echelons and ensure subordinate commanders (and their staffs) have the proper guidance, capabilities, and resources to accomplish their missions. Competent staffs and their innovations are the key to the Army’s ability to adapt and overcome challenges. 0D\ FM 6-0 3-1 Chapter 3 Liaison This chapter defines and describes the role of liaison. It then discusses the liaison element and common ways to organize the liaison element. It addresses liaison functions and responsibilities for sending units, receiving units, and liaisons. The chapter concludes with a discussion on special considerations for liaison. ROLE OF LIAISON 3-1. Liaison is that contact or intercommunication maintained between elements of military forces or other agencies to ensure mutual understanding and unity of purpose and action. Liaison is most commonly used for establishing and maintaining close communications. This enables continuous and direct physical communications among commands and, when necessary, unified action partners. Commanders use liaisons during normal daily activities and operations to help facilitate a shared understanding and purpose among organizations, preserve freedom of action, and maintain flexibility. Liaisons provide commanders with relevant information and answers to operational questions. This enhances commanders’ situational understanding. Note. Liaisons are not planners nor battle captains. Liaisons are often identified as on-call representatives to the plans cell when specific unit or subject matter input is required. Liaisons also work with the current operations integration cell to obtain and disseminate the information needed to be passed between the sending organization and the receiving organization. However, leaders should not expect the liaison to fulfill responsibilities of a planner or watch officer. 3-2. Liaisons support the commander’s ability to synchronize and focus combat power. They establish and maintain physical contact and communications between military units and unified action partners during operations. Liaisons ensure— z Cooperation and understanding among commanders and staffs of different headquarters. z Coordination on operational matters to achieve unity of effort. z Synchronization of lethal and nonlethal effects across multiple domains. z Understanding of implied or inferred coordination measures to achieve synchronized results. LIAISON ELEMENT 3-3. A liaison element is composed of either an individual liaison officer, a liaison team, or a liaison detachment (further discussed in paragraphs 3-5 through 3-10). Based on the situation and types of operations, commanders may receive or request different types of liaison elements to assist with command and control in the various domains. Types of liaison elements include, but are not limited to— z Liaisons to and from subordinate, adjacent, and supporting units. z Liaisons to and from unified action partners. (See JP 3-16.) z An air liaison officer. (See FM 3-09 and JP 3-09.) z A naval gunfire liaison officer. (See FM 3-09 and JP 3-09.) z An Army space support team. (See FM 3-14.) z A special operations liaison officer. (See ADP 3-05.) z Army special operations forces liaison element. (See FM 3-53.) z An Army cyberspace operations support team. (See FM 3-12.) Chapter 3 3-2 FM 6-0 0D\ z An Army information operations (IO) field support team. (See FM 3-13.) z A digital liaison detachment. (See ATP 3-94.1.) 3-4. The recommended organization of personnel in the liaison element varies by echelon. The commander must determine how best to organize a liaison element given the availability of qualified liaisons, echelon of command, and mission variables—mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations, and informational considerations, also known as METT-TC (I).A liaison element can be, but is not limited to— z A liaison officer (individual). z A liaison team (two or more liaison officers). z A liaison detachment (two or more liaison teams). LIAISON OFFICER 3-5. A liaison officer (LNO) is an individual who represents a commander or staff officer for the purpose of maintaining contact or intercommunication between units or organizations. A trained, competent, trusted, and informed LNO is the key to effective liaison. LNOs must have the commander’s full confidence and experience for the mission. LNOs generally transmit information directly bypassing headquarters and staff layers. At higher echelons, the complexity of operations often requires more experience reflected in higher rank required for LNOs. (See table 3-1 for recommended rank.) Table 3-1. Senior liaison officer rank by echelon Senior liaison officer rank by echelon Recommended rank Theater army, multinational, or joint force commander* Colonel Corps Colonel Division Lieutenant colonel Brigade, regiment, or group Captain Battalion Lieutenant *These include joint force commanders and functional component commanders and may also include major interagency and international organizations. 3-6. A LNO normally remains at the receiving unit or organization until recalled by the sending unit. The LNO’s parent unit is referred to as the sending unit. The unit or activity that the LNO is sent to is the receiving unit. As their commander’s representative, LNOs must— z Convey the sending and receiving unit’s commander’s intent, guidance, mission, and concept of operations. z Keep the sending unit informed of the receiving unit plans and operations. z Represent the sending unit commander’s position. z Ensure missions being assigned to the sending unit match its capabilities. z Know how to access sending and receiving unit information. z Know the sending unit’s mission, current and future operations, logistics status, organization, disposition, capabilities, and tactics, techniques, and procedures. z Appreciate and understand the receiving unit’s customs, organization, capabilities, mission, doctrine, and tactics, techniques, and procedures. z Anticipate questions and potential points of conflict and prevent or resolve misunderstandings. z Be familiar with—  Requirements for and purpose of liaison.  The liaison system and its reports, documents, and records.  Liaison team training. z Observe the established channels of command and staff functions. Liaison 0D\ FM 6-0 3-3 z Be tactful and articulate. z Possess familiarity with local culture and language (when liaising with the host nation or with multinational partners) and have advanced regional expertise if possible. 3-7. LNOs generally have access to the commander consistent with the duties involved. However, for routine matters, LNOs work for and receive direction from the chief of staff (COS) or executive officer (XO). Using one officer to perform a liaison mission across the command conserves manpower while guaranteeing a consistent, accurate flow of information. However, continuous operations may require a liaison team or liaison detachment. LIAISON TEAM 3-8. A liaison team consists of two or more LNOs (or LNOs with a liaison noncommissioned officer in charge), clerical personnel, and communications personnel along with their equipment. A liaison team is generally used when the volume or intensity of the duties required exceeds the capabilities of an individual LNO or the separation of units and networks prevents an individual LNO from maintaining situational awareness and connectivity. An example of this is when liaisons are sent to a headquarters with subordinate organizations from unified action partners. LIAISON DETACHMENT 3-9. Multiple liaison teams working together is known as a liaison detachment. The most commonly known liaison detachment for the Army is the digital liaison detachment. A digital liaison detachment is composed of several teams with expertise and equipment in specialized areas, such as intelligence, operations, fire support, air defense, and sustainment. Digital liaison detachments are a unique liaison capability that provides Army commanders with units to conduct liaison within major subordinate or parallel headquarters. Digital liaison detachments consist of staff officers with communications equipment and a broad range of expertise capable of analyzing the situation, facilitating coordination between unified action partners, and assisting in cross-boundary information flow and operational support. These organizations are not only used for routine liaison, but also for advising and assisting unified action partners when planning and executing operations. 3-10. These detachments can operate as a single entity for liaison with a larger unified action headquarters, or provide two smaller teams for digital connectivity and liaison with smaller multinational headquarters. Commanders can tailor digital liaison detachments to match a given mission. The basis of digital liaison detachments allocation is five per committed theater army, one per corps and division serving as a joint task force headquarters, or as approved by the Department of the Army. The support requirement for a coalition during counterinsurgency or foreign internal defense is one digital liaison detachment for each unified action headquarters (division or above) and one for the host-nation Ministry of Defense. (See ATP 3-94.1 for more information on digital liaison detachments.) Note. If either the sending or receiving commander foresees the need to have a liaison element (individual or team) presence for an extended period, it is beneficial to have a signed memorandum of agreement between the two organizations that clearly defines the responsibilities and the limitations of all parties. FUNCTIONS OF LIAISON 3-11. Liaison elements, whether individually or in teams, perform several critical functions that are consistent across all military operations. The extent that these functions are performed depends on the mission and the charter established by the sending organization’s commander. The four basic functions of liaison: z Monitor operations. z Coordinate among staffs. z Advise on capabilities. z Assist in the passing of information. Chapter 3 3-4 FM 6-0 0D\ MONITOR OPERATIONS 3-12. A liaison monitors operations of both the receiving and sending organizations, and understands how each affects the other. At a minimum, a liaison must understand the intent of both the sending and receiving commander, the current situation, planned future operations, and pertinent staff issues. These details will help the liaison monitor the operation while maintaining a working relationship between the sending and receiving organizations. 3-13. To help monitor operations, the liaison must understand the battle rhythm of the receiving unit and inputs to the various meeting and working groups. Liaisons must continually assess where they need to be during the daily operations cycle so they stay abreast of the current situation and keep their sending headquarters fully informed. COORDINATE AMONG STAFFS 3-14. Coordination among staffs alleviates problems before they become elevated. By understanding the receiving unit’s information requirements, the liaison can help give the sending unit the maximum amount of time possible to prepare products. In some cases, the liaison can provide required information from available sources, thus reducing the demand for information from the sending unit. 3-15. The liaison should routinely meet with staff officers and commanders in the receiving headquarters and should know how to contact them readily. To enhance the communications process, the liaison gathers and sends copies of the receiving unit’s standard operating procedures (SOPs), organizational charts, and report formats to the sending unit. The liaison can also provide the receiving command with the sending unit’s SOPs, organizational charts, intelligence products, and other useful information. 3-16. The liaison is an important capability, facilitating effective coordination among staffs. However, the liaison’s work is not a substitute for proper staff interaction. Staff-to-staff coordination is essential at all levels to ensure unity of effort. Established command and control procedures (such as fragmentary orders, warning orders, and operation orders) are the proper method for communicating specific orders, and not liaisons. ADVISE ON CAPABILITIES 3-17. A liaison is the receiving unit’s expert on the sending unit’s capabilities and limitations. The liaison advises the receiving headquarters commander and staff on the optimum employment of the sending unit’s capabilities. Liaisons must be able to answer capability questions posed by the receiving headquarters and other units. However, liaisons only have the authority to make decisions on the allocation of capabilities that the sending unit commander has delegated to them. Liaisons must exercise caution to ensure that they do not obligate the sending unit to missions that exceed the specified scope of the operation, or that they pass information that should be forwarded through normal command channels. ASSIST IN THE PASSING OF INFORMATION 3-18. Liaisons must assist in the passing of information on two levels. First, they must act as the conduit between their command and the receiving command. For example, to further assist the information flow between commands, the liaison should review message addresses and distribution lists. This will ensure that official correspondence between commands is routed properly. The liaison also facilitates the submission of required reports from the sending unit to the receiving headquarters. 3-19. Second, liaisons must integrate themselves into the receiving unit’s daily operations in order to provide the most current information for decision making. By integrating themselves into the receiving unit’s daily operation cycle and battle rhythm, LNOs can answer questions from groups such as the targeting cell, plans cell, and command group to ensure those groups make informed decisions. Liaison 0D\ FM 6-0 3-5 LIAISON RESPONSIBILITIES 3-20. Maintaining effective liaison is a significant responsibility. Liaisons must be an integral part of both the receiving and sending unit staffs. These officers have specific responsibilities throughout a liaison tour. These responsibilities can be divided as— z Sending unit responsibilities. z Receiving unit responsibilities. z Liaison responsibilities. SENDING UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES 3-21. The most important sending unit responsibility is to select and train the best qualified Soldiers for liaison duties. Liaison personnel capably perform tasks discussed in paragraph 3-6. To help ensure effective liaison, the sending unit should describe liaison procedures in its unit SOP. At a minimum, the SOP includes a liaison handbook, sample questions that liaisons should be able to answer, and a liaison packing list. (See figure 3-1 for an example outline of a liaison handbook. See figure 3-2 on page 3-6 for example questions that liaisons should be able to answer. See figure 3-3 on page 3-7 for an example liaison packing list.) Liaison Handbook Table of contents.

Can the controlled supply rate support the receiving unit’s plan? What are the receiving unit’s commander’s critical information requirements? At what time, phase, or event are commander’s critical information requirements expected to change? Are there any items the commander’s critical information requirements do not contain with which the sending unit can help? Which sending commander decisions are critical to executing the receiving unit operation? What are the “no-later-than” times for those decisions? What assets does the unit need to acquire to accomplish its mission? How would the unit use them? How do the assets support attaining the senior commander’s intent? From where can the unit obtain them? Higher headquarters? Other Services? Multinational partners? How do units use aviation assets? How can the liaison officers communicate with the sending unit? Are telephones, radios, computers, and other information systems readily available? Where are these devices located? What will be the primary, alternate, contingency, and emergency plans for secure and nonsecure communications? Which communications are secure? What terrain did the unit designate as key? Decisive? What weather conditions would have a major impact on the operation? What effect would a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environment have on the operation? What effect would large numbers of refugees or enemy prisoners of war have on the receiving unit’s operations? What is the worst thing that could happen during execution of the current operation? How would a unit handle a passage of lines by other units through the force? What conditions would cause the unit to request operational control of a multinational force? If the unit is placed under operational control of a larger multinational force, or given operational control of a smaller such force, what special problems would it present? If going to a multinational force headquarters, how do the tactical principles and command concepts of that force differ from those of U.S. forces? What host-nation support is available to the sending unit? What are the required reports from higher and sending units’ standard operating procedures? In the absence of further guidance, what must be done to fulfill the commander’s intent? Does the receiving unit have secure storage availability (for classified document)? Figure 3-2. Example questions that liaisons should be able to answer Liaison 0D\ FM 6-0 3-7 Credentials (including courier card; security clearances; SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network [known as SIPRNET] token; and permissive jump orders, if qualified).

The sending unit should be able to describe the liaison element capabilities to the receiving unit and provide the number and types of vehicles, personnel, equipment, call signs, and frequencies. They should also identify liaison requirements for such things as— z Point-to-point transportation. z Identification and appropriate credentials for the receiving unit. z Appropriate security clearance, courier orders, and information systems accredited for use on the receiving unit’s network. z The SOPs outlining the missions, functions, procedures, and duties of the sending unit’s liaison section. z If the receiving unit is multinational, communications equipment and personnel to assist liaisons with linguistic challenges and to ensure compatibility with communications systems. 3-23. The movement from the sending unit to the receiving unit requires careful planning and coordination. (See figure 3-4 on page 3-8 for potential liaison checklist of things to accomplish before departing the sending unit.) Chapter 3 3-8 FM 6-0 0D\ Understand what the sending commander wants the receiving commander to know. Receive a briefing from operations, intelligence, and other staff elements on current and future operations. Receive and understand the tasks from the sending unit staff. Obtain the correct maps (traces and overlays) and or mapping software and datum. Arrange for transport, communications equipment, and signal instructions—including their protection and security.Arrange for replacement of these items, as necessary. Complete route-reconnaissance and time-management plans so the liaison team arrives at the designated location on time. Ensure that liaison team and interpreters have security clearances and access appropriate for the mission. Verify that the receiving unit received the liaison team’s security clearances and will grant access to the level of information the mission requires. Verify courier orders. Know how to destroy classified information if an emergency occurs during transit or at the receiving unit. Inform the sending unit of the liaison officer’s departure time, route, arrival time, and, when known, the estimated time and route of return. Pick up all hard copy material or digital media designated for the receiving unit. Conduct a radio or communications check with all communications devices. Know the impending moves of the sending and receiving units. Bring accredited information systems needed to support liaison operations. Pack adequate rations, water, ammunition, individual equipment, and other necessities for use in transit. Arrange for the liaison party’s departure, to include transportation of individual equipment and personal gear. Figure 3-4. Example liaison checklist before departing the sending unit RECEIVING UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES 3-24. Units receiving liaisons have responsibilities to provide access and support. Without adequate access to unit meetings and facilities as well as life support, liaisons will not be able to accomplish their duties. The receiving unit— z Provides the sending unit with the liaison’s reporting time, place, points of contact, recognition signal, and password. z Provides details of any tactical movement and logistics information relevant to the liaison’s mission, especially while the liaison is in transit. z Ensures that the liaison has access to the commander, the COS or XO, and other officers, as required. z Gives the liaison an initial briefing of the unit battle rhythm and allows the liaison access necessary to remain informed of current operations. z Protects the liaison while at the receiving unit. z Publishes an SOP outlining the missions, functions, procedures to request information, information release restrictions and clearance procedures, and duties of the liaison at the receiving unit. z If possible, provides access to communications equipment (and operating instructions, as needed) when the liaison needs to communicate using the receiving unit’s equipment. z Provides adequate workspace for the liaisons. z Provides logistics support or agreed to host-nation or unified action partner support. Liaison 0D\ FM 6-0 3-9 LIAISON RESPONSIBILITIES UPON ARRIVAL 3-25. Upon arrival, the liaison completes inprocessing and verifies the concept of operations with the receiving unit’s commander and staff. The liaison integrates with the receiving unit’s staff and begins to perform duties as required. Specific responsibilities may include, but are not limited to— z Check in with security and complete any required documentation. z Report to and present credentials to the COS (or XO) or supervisor, as appropriate. z Arrange for an office call with the commander. z Meet coordinating and special staff officers. z Notify the sending unit of arrival (use the liaison establishment report). z Visit staff elements, brief them on the sending unit’s situation, and collect information from them. z Deliver all correspondence designated for the receiving unit. LIAISON RESPONSIBILITIES DURING THE TOUR 3-26. During their tour, liaisons have specific responsibilities. Liaisons inform the receiving unit’s commander or staff of the sending unit’s needs or requirements. Due to the numbers of liaisons in the headquarters, sending units guard against inundating the receiving unit with formal requests for information. By virtue of their location in the headquarters and knowledge of the situation, liaisons can rapidly answer questions from the sending unit and keep the receiving unit from wasting planning time answering requests for information. During the liaison tour, liaisons responsibilities are, but not limited to— z Arrive at the designated location on time. z Keep a daily log of activities. z Promote cooperation between the sending and receiving units. z Accomplish their mission without becoming overly involved in the receiving unit’s staff procedures or actions; however, they may assist higher echelon staffs in war gaming. z Follow the receiving unit’s communications procedures. z Inform the sending unit headquarters of planned communications outages, such as when the receiving unit displaces. z Actively obtain information without interfering with the receiving unit’s operations. z Facilitate understanding of the sending unit’s commander’s intent. z Help the sending unit’s commander assess current and future operations. z Remain informed of the sending unit’s current situation and provide that information to the receiving unit’s commander and staff. z Quickly inform the sending unit of the receiving unit’s upcoming missions, tasks, and orders. z Ensure the sending unit has a copy of the receiving unit’s SOP. z Inform the receiving unit’s commander or COS or XO of the content of reports transmitted to the sending unit. z Keep a record of their reports, listing everyone met (including each person’s name, rank, duty position, email address, and telephone number) as well as key staff members and their telephone numbers and email address. z Attempt to resolve issues within the receiving unit before involving the sending unit. z Notify the sending unit promptly if unable to accomplish the liaison mission. z Pick up all courier correspondence for the sending unit when departing the receiving unit. z Inform the receiving unit of the liaison officer’s departure time, return route, and expected arrival time at the sending unit. z Submit a liaison disestablishment report to the sending unit when departing. z Report their departure to the receiving unit’s commander at the end of their mission. 3-27. Once a deploying liaison arrives and sets up communications at the receiving unit, they submit a unit liaison establishment report to the sending unit. This report informs the sending unit’s command that the liaison is ready to conduct liaison, and it establishes exactly what systems are available. A redeploying liaison Chapter 3 3-10 FM 6-0 0D\ submits a liaison disestablishment report to the sending unit as a last action prior to disconnecting digital devices. This report informs the command that the liaison is leaving the network and is no longer capable of conducting liaison at any level beyond unsecure voice. (See unit SOPs for liaison establishment report and liaison disestablishment report formats.) LIAISON RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER THE TOUR 3-28. After returning, liaisons promptly transmit the receiving unit’s requests to the sending unit’s commander or staff, as appropriate. A liaison tour is not complete until a liaison has fulfilled the after-tour duties. After-tour duties include, but are not limited to— z Briefing the COS or XO and appropriate staff elements. z Preparing the necessary reports. z Conducting an after action review. 3-29. Effective returning liaisons provide clear, concise, complete information. If the accuracy of information is in doubt, they quote the receiving unit source and include the source in the report. Liaisons limit their remarks to mission-related observations. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 3-30. Liaison practices for unified action operations require greater liaison efforts than liaison between Army headquarters. Most of these operations involve liaisons understanding other staff organization, doctrine, and authorities. Liaisons for these types of operations may require additional training, information systems, and expertise to perform their mission. 3-31. When possible, a liaison is sent from a lower echelon to a higher echelon, a supporting echelon to a supported echelon, and between adjacent organizations. Liaison must be reciprocal when U.S. forces are placed under control of a headquarters of a different nationality and vice versa, or when brigade-sized and larger formations of different nationalities are adjacent. When not reciprocal, the following practices apply to liaison where applicable: z In contiguous operations, units on the left establish liaison with units on their right. z In contiguous operations, units of the same echelon establish liaison with those to their front. z In noncontiguous operations, units establish liaison with units within closest proximity. z Units not in contact with the enemy establish liaison with units in contact with the enemy. z During a passage of lines, the passing unit establishes liaison with the stationary unit. z During a relief in place, the relieving unit establishes liaison with the unit being relieved. z If liaison is broken, both units act to reestablish it. However, the primary responsibility rests with the unit originally responsible for establishing liaison. JOINT OPERATIONS 3-32. Serving as a liaison to a joint forces headquarters is typically more challenging than serving to an Army headquarters. In order to be effective, liaisons serving on a joint headquarters must adequately understand joint doctrine, a joint headquarters organization, and joint headquarters functions. Joint terminology used at the joint headquarters may have different definitions and associated connotations from Army terminology. Therefore, liaisons must ensure they achieve mutual understanding and communicate the meaning—not simply the terms—to the commander and organization which they represent. Furthermore, not all information systems used within a joint headquarters may be fully compatible with those used among subordinate echelons. Liaisons must determine how to best communicate with their parent organization. INTERAGENCY OPERATIONS 3-33. Army forces may participate in interagency operations, especially when conducting stability or defense support of civil authorities’ operations. Frequently, Army forces conduct operations in cooperation with or in support of civilian government agencies. Relationships in these operations are rarely based on standard military command and support relationships; rather, national laws or specific agreements for each situation Liaison 0D\ FM 6-0 3-11 govern the specific relationships in interagency operations. Defense support of civil authorities provides an excellent example. Federal military forces that respond to a domestic disaster will support the Federal Emergency Management Agency, while National Guard forces working in state active duty status (Title 32 United States Code) or conducting National Guard defense support of civil authorities will support that state’s emergency management agency. National Guard forces federalized under Title 10 United States Code will support the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The goal is always unity of effort of military forces and civilian agencies, although unity of command may not be possible. Effective liaison and continuous coordination become keys to mission accomplishment. 3-34. Some missions require coordination with nongovernmental organizations. While no overarching interagency doctrine delineates or dictates the relationships and procedures governing all agencies, departments, and organizations in interagency operations, the National Response Framework provides some guidance. Effective liaison elements work toward establishing mutual trust and confidence, continuously coordinating actions to achieve cooperation and unity of effort. In these situations, liaisons require a broader understanding of the interagency environment, responsibilities, motivations, and limitations of nongovernmental organizations, and the relationships these organizations have with the U.S. military. (See JP 3-08 for more information on interorganizational cooperation.) MULTINATIONAL OPERATIONS 3-35. Multinational operations present unique command and control challenges. These include cultural and language issues, interoperability challenges, national caveats on the use of forces, the sharing of information and intelligence, and rules of engagement. Establishing SOPs and liaison with multinational partners is critical to effective command and control. When commanding and controlling forces within a multinational training or operational setting, Army commanders should be familiar with and employ multinational doctrine and standards ratified by the United States. For example, Allied Tactical Publication-3.2.2 applies to Army forces during the conduct of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operations. (See FM 3-16 for a detailed discussion on multinational operations.) 3-36. Army units often operate as part of a multinational force. Interoperability is an essential requirement for multinational operations. The NATO defines interoperability as the ability to operate in synergy in the execution of assigned tasks. Interoperability is also the condition achieved among communications electronics systems or items of satisfactory communication between them and their users. The degree of interoperability should be defined when referring to specific cases. Examples of interoperability include the deployment of a computer network (such as the Combined Enterprise Network Theater Information Exchange System) to facilitate staff intercommunication. Nations whose forces are interoperable can operate together effectively in numerous ways. Less interoperable forces have correspondingly fewer ways to work together. Although frequently identified with technology, important areas of interoperability include doctrine, procedures, communications, and training. Factors that enhance interoperability include planning for interoperability, conducting multinational training exercises, staff visits to assess multinational capabilities, a command atmosphere that rewards sharing information and emphasizes the joint’s write for release, and command emphasis on a constant effort to eliminate the sources of confusion and misunderstanding. 3-37. The multinational forces with which the U.S. operates may not have information systems that are compatible with U.S. or coalition systems. Some nations may lack computerized information systems. Reciprocal liaison is especially important under these conditions. Mutual trust and confidence is the key to making these multinational operations successful. Liaison during multinational operations includes explicit coordination of doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures. Effective liaison requires patience and tact during personal interactions. A liaison needs a thorough understanding of the strategic, operational, and tactical aims of the international effort. Foreign disclosure limitations often require special communications and liaison arrangements to address cultural differences and sensitivities and to ensure explicit understanding throughout the multinational force. The liaison should coordinate with the unit foreign disclosure officer to ensure the information releasability to multinational partners. 3-38. A multinational coordination center or coalition coordination center is a means of increasing multinational coordination. U.S. commanders routinely create such a center in the early stages of any coalition effort, especially one that is operating under a parallel command structure. It is a proven means of integrating the participating nations’ military forces into the coalition planning and operations processes, Chapter 3 3-12 FM 6-0 0D\ enhancing coordination and cooperation, and supporting an open and full interaction within the coalition structure. Normally, the multinational coordination center focuses upon coordination of coalition force operations, which will most likely involve classified information. (See FM 3-16 and JP 3-16 for more information on multinational operations.) CONCLUSION 3-39. While different situations will offer unique challenges, all liaisons must remember that they represent their commanders and their organizations. Their actions must remain synchronized with their commander’s intent, and they must stay aware of changing priorities. Likewise, effective liaisons are loyal to their commanders, yet they are professional and diplomatic in their engagements with those outside the organization who hold different perspectives. Whether representing a battalion or a theater army, liaisons must be effective communicators and work with a variety of personalities and individuals from various backgrounds who represent organizations ranging from higher echelon headquarters to multinational partners and other unified action partners. 0D\ FM 6-0 4-1 Chapter 4 Battle Rhythm and Meetings This chapter begins by defining and describing battle rhythm. It addresses responsibilities for building and managing a unit’s battle rhythm followed by a discussion of ways to develop a battle rhythm. The chapter concludes by providing examples of various meetings typically included in a unit’s battle rhythm. No standard battle rhythm exists for every situation. Different echelons, types of units, and types of operations require commanders and staffs to develop their unit’s battle rhythm based on the situation. Sample meetings in this chapter illustrate division headquarters. Units should modify these meeting examples based on their echelon, situation, and commanders’ preferences. BATTLE RHYTHM 4-1. A headquarters’ battle rhythm consists of a series of meetings (to include working groups and boards), briefings, and other activities synchronized by time and purpose. The battle rhythm is a deliberate daily cycle of command, staff, and unit activities intended to synchronize current and future operations. The chief of staff (COS) or executive officer (XO) oversees the unit’s battle rhythm. The COS or XO ensures activities are logically sequenced so that the output of one activity informs another activity’s inputs.This is important not only within the headquarters, but also in the unit’s battle rhythm as it nests with the higher echelon headquarters. The battle rhythm ensures that the staff provides the information pertinent to decisions and the recommendations on decisions made in the headquarters in a timely manner to influence the decision making of the higher echelon headquarters, where appropriate. (See Appendix B for details on military briefings.) 4-2. Understanding the purpose and potential decisions of each meeting and activity is equally important. This understanding allows members of the staff and subordinate commanders to provide appropriate input to influence decisions. The battle rhythm enables— z A commander’s decision making. z A routine for staff interaction and coordination. z Interaction between the commander and staff. z Staff synchronization across time, space, and purpose. z Planning by the staff. 4-3. The battle rhythm changes during execution as operations progress. For example, early in the operation a commander may require a daily plans update briefing. As the situation changes, the commander may only require a plans update every three days. Some factors that help determine a unit’s battle rhythm include the staff’s proficiency, higher echelon headquarters’ battle rhythm, and current mission. In developing the unit’s battle rhythm, the COS or XO considers— z Higher headquarters’ battle rhythm and report requirements. z Subordinate headquarters’ battle rhythm requirements. z The duration and intensity of the operation. z Integrating cells’ planning requirements. 4-4. Table 4-1 on page 4-2 illustrates a sample division headquarters battle rhythm incorporating many of the events and considerations discussed in paragraphs 4-1 through 4-3.

All personnel in the command post (CP) are informed of the unit’s battle rhythm, and they are prepared for those events they are scheduled to participate in. Key individuals responsible for developing and managing a unit’s battle rhythm include— z Commander. z COS or XO. Battle Rhythm and Meetings 0D\ FM 6-0 4-3 z Knowledge management officer. z Coordinating, special, and personal staff officers. Commander 4-6. A commander’s decisions ultimately guide the actions of the force. Decision making requires knowing if, when, and what to decide and understanding the consequences of that decision. As such, the development and management of the unit’s battle rhythm must directly support the commander’s decision-making style. 4-7. Each commander has a unique personal decision-making style and staff interaction preference. For example, one commander may prefer to chair the targeting board, whereas another prefers to delegate decision-making authority for the targeting board to a deputy commander. To develop an effective battle rhythm that supports their decision-making style, commanders share their preferences with the staff and provide guidance including— z Specific meetings they require and preferred frequency. z Delegation of decision-making authority for specific meetings and functions. z Attendance and guidance for meetings outside of the headquarters. Chief of Staff or Executive Officer 4-8. The COS or XO oversees the development and management of the unit’s battle rhythm. Working with the staff, the COS or XO ensures headquarters activities support the commander and activities are logically sequenced so that the output of one activity informs inputs of another activity. The COS or XO also ensures the unit’s battle rhythm nests with the higher headquarters and supporting units while enabling timely direction and guidance to subordinate units. 4-9. The COS or XO balances staff duties and responsibilities with the time required to plan, prepare, and execute meetings. This includes examining meeting attendance requirements. Some staff sections may lack the personnel to attend all events. The COS or XO and staff members constantly look for ways to combine meetings and eliminate unproductive ones. Note. During surges in tempo, the COS and staff primaries may combine two or more working groups to synchronize efforts and increase efficiencies while minimizing requirements on the staff. Examples include combining the civil-military operations working group, information operations working group, and cyberspace electromagnetic activities working group to streamline coordination prior to the targeting working group. Knowledge Management Officer 4-10. Developing and managing a unit’s battle rhythm is a key aspect of knowledge management. Using the knowledge management process (assess, design, develop, pilot, and implement as discussed in paragraph 5- 17), the knowledge management officer assists the COS or XO and staff primary officers in developing and managing the battle rhythm. Management officers advise the commander and staff on time management, meeting management, content management, and report analysis. The knowledge management working group (see paragraph 4-43) serves as a forum to help manage the unit’s battle rhythm. (See ATP 6-01.1 for detailed information on these topics.) Coordinating, Special, and Personal Staff Officers 4-11. Staff officers of the coordinating, special, and personal staffs have important roles in developing and managing the unit’s battle rhythm. Each staff section analyzes its information requirements to ensure it receives and provides relevant information within its area of expertise. Staff officers recommend report requirements and propose meetings for inclusion in the unit’s battle rhythm. For each meeting a staff section leads, the responsible staff officer develops meeting instructions as described in paragraphs 4-24 and 4-25. 4-12. Staff officers assist the COS or XO in the management and discipline of the battle rhythm during execution. They ensure meetings that they lead prove effective and that members of their staff sections come Chapter 4 4-4 FM 6-0 0D\ prepared for meetings requiring their participation. Staff officers assist the COS or XO with identifying unproductive meetings and ways to combine meetings when beneficial. BATTLE RHYTHM DEVELOPMENT 4-13. Developing an effective battle rhythm requires detailed planning and analysis. Rarely does a unit start from scratch when developing its battle rhythm. Unit operations normally provide a standard battle rhythm in which the unit expects to operate. Upon receipt of mission, the unit’s standard operating procedure (known as SOP) serves as the basis for developing the unit’s battle rhythm for specific operations. In addition to understanding the commander’s decision-making style and preference, the staff considers the following when developing the unit’s battle rhythm: z Higher echelon headquarters, support, and supporting events and report requirements. z Type and intensity of operations. z Logical arrangement of events. z Time available. Note. A battle rhythm must be rigid enough to keep the organization running on optimum levels but flexible enough to enable the unit to adapt to changes in an operational environment and additional requirements. Also, timing, spacing, and sequencing of events on a unit’s battle rhythm must be able to facilitate task execution, assessments, information flow, and decision making. Higher Echelon Headquarters 4-14. Understanding the information requirements and battle rhythm of the higher echelon headquarters is essential to developing the unit’s battle rhythm. Standards and timeline submission of reports and requests for support (including operations summaries, transportation requests, and target nominations) and required attendance or input to higher echelon headquarters meetings all require that a subordinate unit’s battle rhythm is nested with its higher headquarters. 4-15. A technique for initially developing the unit’s battle rhythm is to analyze the higher echelon headquarters’ battle rhythm, including identifying higher headquarters meetings and reports that require the unit’s participation or input. The staff also identifies information requirements and meetings of supporting units. This helps the staff identify internal meetings and report requirements. It also helps determine the scheduling of internal meetings and reports so staffs can provide timely input to the higher echelon or supporting headquarters. For example, the higher headquarters will require subordinate units to submit target nominations and requests by a certain time per the published battle rhythm. To ensure timely input to higher headquarters, the subordinate staff members perform a time analysis on when they need to conduct their internal targeting working group and targeting board so target nominations reach the higher headquarters on time. Type of Operations 4-16. The type and intensity of operations are both important considerations when developing or modifying a unit’s battle rhythm. During high-tempo operations involving offense and defense (such as large-scale combat operations), planning and timelines for making decisions are often shortened. For operations dominated by stability (such as counterinsurgency), the planning and times for making decisions are often longer. Meetings can be less frequent and spread out over a weekly or monthly calendar. In addition, the staff may develop nonstandard working groups or boards not found in its unit standard operating procedures. Examples may include an economic development working group or civil projects working group and board. Logical Arrangement of Events 4-17. The commander’s guidance and decision-making requirements, an analysis of the higher headquarters’ battle rhythm, and an understanding of the type and intensity of operations all help the staff to identify events for inclusion in the unit’s battle rhythm. Before sequencing events, it is helpful to associate actual time windows to planning horizons and identify major decision-making events associated with each planning Battle Rhythm and Meetings 0D\ FM 6-0 4-5 horizon. This understanding helps the staff logically sequence events so that outputs from one battle rhythm event provide inputs to others, in support of the commander’s decision-making requirements, by planning horizon. 4-18. Another technique for sequencing events is to address one function at a time (such as targeting). For targeting, the staff would identify the medium and time for when target nominations are due to the higher headquarters and then backward plan events in order to support input to the higher headquarters targeting process. A potential sequence may include conducting the information collection working group’s meetings before the targeting working group, followed by conducting a targeting board to obtain approval of the commander’s targeting guidance and target nomination. After developing a logical sequence of events for each functional area, the staff then nests functional events with each other. The staff can then develop a consolidated battle rhythm schedule. This may be a daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly schedule. Time Available 4-19. When developing the battle rhythm, it is important to incorporate additional time for thinking, battlefield circulation, planning, analysis and personal time (including sleep, relaxation, and exercise). A common error in battle rhythm development involves scheduling numerous events where the commander, staff principals, and action officers attend a continuous progression of meetings, working groups, and other events. In this environment, the commander or members of the staff lack the time to think or work on projects. The negative impacts of a “jam-packed” battle rhythm go beyond the commander and staff and affect subordinate units. 4-20. Combining working groups and decision boards helps free up time for commanders and staffs to maximize efficiency in the unit’s battle rhythm. Commanders must assess the situation to determine the most effective use of time available and limit organizational energy to focus on key events. BATTLE RHYTHM APPROVAL 4-21. The COS or XO typically approves the battle rhythm. A technique for gaining approval is for the COS or XO to meet with the primary staff to review, discuss, and approve the battle rhythm. This includes a review and approval of meeting instructions (purpose, frequency, participation, agenda, inputs, and outputs) for each meeting on the schedule (see paragraphs 4-24 and 4-25). The COS or XO may ask the following questions as considerations for approving the battle rhythm and meeting events: z Does the battle rhythm support the commander’s decision-making style and requirements? z Is the battle rhythm nested with higher events? z Does the battle rhythm match the events happening on the ground and the intensity of the operations? z Does the battle rhythm allow subordinate units to establish their routines? z Is there time between routine events to allow for leaders and staffs for other activities to include personal time? z Is the battle rhythm flexible enough to allow disruptions such as very important person (known as VIP) visits or displacing command posts? z For each meeting—  Is the meeting necessary?  Is there a clear purpose to the meeting?  Does the meeting feed other meetings and ultimately lead to timely decisions?  Did the staff identify and synchronize the inputs and outputs of the meetings?  Do those involved have sufficient time to prepare for the meeting?  Does this meeting avoid duplicating other meetings?  Are the proper attendees at the meeting? Chapter 4 4-6 FM 6-0 0D\ MEETINGS 4-22. Meetings are gatherings to present and exchange information, solve problems, coordinate action, and make decisions. They may involve the staff; the commander and staff; or the commander, subordinate commanders, staff, and others as necessary (including unified action partners). Who attends depends on the issue. Commanders establish meetings to integrate the staff and enhance planning and decision making within the headquarters. Commanders also identify staff members to participate in the higher commander’s meeting, including working groups and boards. Staffs must share decisions made during meetings internally within the headquarters, with the higher echelon headquarters, and with subordinate units. (See JP 3-33 for more information on various working groups and boards used by joint force commanders.) 4-23. Often, the commander establishes and maintains only those meetings required by the situation.Commanders (assisted by the COS or XO) establish, modify, and dissolve meetings as the situation evolves. The COS or XO manages the timing of these events through the unit’s battle rhythm. 4-24. Efficient meetings help build and maintain shared understanding, facilitate decision making, and coordinate action. To ensure meetings are organized, a unit’s standard operating procedures should address— z Purpose. z Frequency. z Composition (including the meeting’s chair, participants, and note taker). z Inputs and expected outputs. z Agenda. 4-25. Clearly defining the purpose and desired outputs of each meeting helps with assigning responsibilities and suspenses for staff inputs, formatting outputs, and meeting membership requirements. A technique is for the COS or XO to bring the staff together to discuss, modify, and approve the instructions for each meeting as part of battle rhythm development. Following approval by the COS or XO, meeting instructions become part of the unit’s standard operating procedure. Table 4-2 shows one technique for organizing and publishing meeting instructions. Table 4-2. Example meeting instructions General Participants x Title. x Purpose. x Frequency. x Duration. x Location. x Medium. x Staff lead. x Chair. x Members. Inputs and Outputs Agenda x Inputs. x Outputs. x First item. x Second item. MEETING NOTES 4-26. Recording and sharing the results of each meeting helps maintain shared understanding internal and external to the headquarters. Staff leads capture relevant information at the conclusion of each meeting to include issues, recommendations, decisions, guidance, and taskings. The unit’s knowledge management plan should provide a standard format for meeting notes and provide instructions on where to place and how to access meeting notes on the unit’s web portal. An example format for meeting minutes includes the— z Meeting title. z Date and time group. z Attendees. z Meeting summary to include— Battle Rhythm and Meetings 0D\ FM 6-0 4-7  Issues raised.  Recommendations determined.  Decisions made.  Guidance offered.  Taskings or any due-outs decided upon. TYPES OF MEETINGS 4-27. The number of meetings and the subjects they address depend on the situation and echelon. While numerous informal meetings occur daily within a headquarters, meetings commonly included in a unit’s battle rhythm and the cells responsible for them include— z A shift-change briefing (current operations integration cell). z An operations update and assessment briefing (current operations integration cell). z An operations synchronization meeting (current operations integration cell). z Planning meetings and briefings (plans or future operations cells). z Working groups and boards (various functional and integrating cells). Shift-Change Briefing 4-28. During continuous operations, the staff operates in shifts. At the beginning of each shift, the COS or XO oversees a shift-change briefing. Staff section leaders of the outgoing shift meet with and brief the ongoing shift on current operations. The briefing’s purpose is to inform the incoming shift of— z Current and projected enemy situations. z Current friendly situation, including changes in unit location, disposition, and task organization. z Significant activities that occurred in the last 12 hours. z Anticipated events and decisions anticipated during the next 24 hours. 4-29. In those instances when a battle update briefing (see paragraph 4-30) or a commander’s update briefing (see paragraph 4-31) is scheduled, the staff may not conduct a shift-change briefing. Following these updates, shift leaders and watch officers meet face-to-face and exchange information before the new shift assumes responsibilities. (See Chapter 9 for information on shift-change methods and additional information on shift change briefings.) Battle Update Briefing 4-30. The battle update briefing is a staff update to the commander on the progress of current operations. It includes a summary of the current situation and a review of upcoming events and decisions. Staff members provide the commander a summary of their running estimates to include any concerns and recommendations to modify current operations. The commander ends the briefing with guidance to the staff that may result in a fragmentary order to subordinate units. Sample instructions for a division-level battle update briefing are shown in table 4-3 on page 4-8. Chapter 4 4-8 FM 6-0 0D\ Table 4-3. Example battle update briefing General Information Participants Title: Battle update briefing.

The commander’s update briefing is an assessment of the current operations by the staff and subordinate commanders. It differs from the battle update briefing in that subordinate commanders participate and provide their assessment of current operations to the commander. In addition, subordinate commanders identify concerns and offer recommendations for modifying the current order (such as a change to task organization or moving the coordinated fire line).

The operations synchronization meeting is a key battle rhythm event to ensure that operations remain synchronized in the short-range planning horizon. Chaired by a deputy commander or the G-3 or S-3 representative of each CP cell and separate staff section as required, the participants meet to assess the progress of current operations and review upcoming decision points and critical events. Members identify changes in the situation requiring adjustments to the current operation order. They then develop directives to synchronize units and warfighting functions in accordance with the commander’s intent and guidance. Key outputs from this meeting include changes or recommended changes to the current operation order resulting in a fragmentary order. 4-33. Since the operations synchronization meeting is a short-range planning event that results in decisions, commanders empower the meeting chair to make appropriate decisions to ensure operations remain synchronized with the commander’s intent. The operations synchronization meeting does not replace the continuous monitoring, coordination, and decision making that occurs in the current operations integration cell (known as COIC). When an event occurs or an immediate decision is required, the current operations integration cell takes action within its delegated authority. The current operations integration cell employs battle drills or uses the rapid decision-making and synchronization process to address issues as the situation requires. (See Appendix E for battle drills and see FM 5-0 for the rapid decision-making and synchronization process.)

Working groups address various subjects depending on the situation and echelon. A working group is a grouping of predetermined staff representatives who meet to provide analysis, coordinate, and provide recommendations for a particular purpose or function. Battalion and brigade headquarters have fewer working groups than higher echelons do. Working groups may convene daily, weekly, monthly, or intermittently depending on the subject, situation, and echelon. Typical working groups at division and corps headquarters scheduled within the unit’s battle rhythm include— z Assessment working group. z Civil-military operations working group. z Cyberspace electromagnetic activities (CEMA) working group. z Information collection working group. z Information operations (IO) working group. z Knowledge management working group. z Protection working group. z Sustainment working group. z Targeting working group. z Airspace control working group. Battle Rhythm and Meetings 0D\ FM 6-0 4-11 Assessment Working Group 4-35. A key aspect of any operation is determining progress toward completing tasks, achieving objectives, and obtaining a desired end. Commanders establish an assessment working group to assist them in identifying changes in an operational environment and determining if actions are achieving objectives. While assessment occurs throughout the headquarters, including assessing current operations and conducting battle damage assessment, the assessment working group’s focus is toward the mid- to long-range planning horizons. Products from the assessment working group serve as inputs to boards, other working groups, and planning teams as well as collated, synthesized, and refined information into a collective staff assessment for the commander. 4-36. Commanders have several options for selecting a staff section to lead the assessment working group. Options include the G-5 section, G-3 or S-3 staff sections, or a newly established stand-alone assessment staff section. Sample instructions for a division-level assessment working group are shown in table 4-6. Table 4-6. Sample assessment working group General Information Participants Title: Assessment working group.

Civil-military operations are activities of a commander performed by designated military forces that establish, maintain, influence, or exploit relations between military forces and indigenous populations and institutions by directly supporting the achievement of objectives relating to the reestablishment or maintenance of stability within a region or host nation (JP 3-57). Commanders establish a civil-military operations working group to assist them with planning, preparing, executing, and assessing civil-military operations. Outputs of the civil-military operations working group serve as inputs to several boards and working groups, including targeting, sustainment, and IO. 4-38. Chaired by the G-9 or S-9, the civil-military operations working group brings together various stakeholders involved in promoting stability and civil-military relationships within the area of operations. (See FM 3-57 for more information on civil affairs operations.) Sample instructions for a division-level civil- military operations working group are listed in table 4-7 on page 4-12.

The CEMA working group primarily works to integrate cyberspace operations and electromagnetic warfare. Cyberspace electromagnetic activities is the process of planning, integrating, and synchronizing cyberspace and electronic warfare operations in support of unified land operations (ADP 3-0). CEMA synchronizes the activities of cyberspace operations, electromagnetic warfare, and spectrum management operations elements. (See FM 3-12 for more information on cyberspace and electromagnetic warfare operations). 4-40. The CEMA working group is a collaborative staff meeting led by the cyber electromagnetic warfare officer to analyze, coordinate, and provide recommendations for integrating cyberspace operations and electromagnetic warfare into the concept of operations or a particular event. Sample instructions for a division-level CEMA working group are listed in table 4-8. Battle Rhythm and Meetings 0D\ FM 6-0 4-13 Table 4-8.

Information collection is an activity that synchronizes and integrates the planning and employment of sensors and assets as well as the processing, exploitation, and dissemination systems in direct support of current and future operations (FM 3-55). The commander establishes an information collection working group to coordinate and integrate information collection in support of the concept of operations. Led by the G-2, the group ensures maximum efficiency using information collection assets by developing and maintaining the unit’s information collection plan. (See FM 3-55 for more information on information collection.) Table 4-9 lists sample instructions for a division-level information collection working group. Table 4-9.

The IO working group is led by the IO officer and is the primary mechanism for ensuring effects in and through the information environment are planned and synchronized to support the commander’s intent and concept of operations. The commander establishes an IO working group to synchronize information- related activities into the concept of operations to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative in the information environment. This means the staff must ensure targets are identified and nominated at the right place and time to achieve decisive results. To ensure this happens, the IO working group occurs regularly in the unit’s battle rhythm and usually occurs before the targeting working group. (See FM 3-13 for doctrine on IO and a listing of information-related capabilities.) Sample instructions for a division-level IO working group are located in table 4-10. Table 4-10.

Members of the targeting working group perform the detailed staff work associated with targeting. Based on the commander’s guidance and priorities, the targeting working group determines which targets to engage and how, where, and when to engage them. The staff then assigns friendly capabilities to locate and track targets and engage those targets to produce the desired effect on each target. Members present the results of their work to the commander at the targeting board (see paragraphs 4-58 and 4-59) for approval.

The commander establishes working groups and boards to bring together cross-functional expertise to coordinate actions, solve problems, and make decisions. A board is a grouping of predetermined staff representatives with delegated decision authority for a particular purpose or function. The primary difference between boards and working groups is the level of authority granted to boards by the commander. 4-49. The commander or a senior leader chairs boards with members of the boards consisting of staff elements, subordinate commands, and other organization representatives as required. Typical boards found on the unit’s battle rhythm include the— z Operations assessment board. z Plans synchronization board. z Sustainment board. z Targeting board. Operations Assessment Board 4-50. Assessment precedes and guides the other activities of the operations process. Assessment involves deliberately comparing forecasted outcomes with actual events to determine the overall effectiveness of force employment. More specifically, assessment helps the commander determine progress toward attaining the desired end state, achieving objectives, and completing tasks. It also involves continuously monitoring and evaluating an operational environment to determine what changes may affect the conduct of operations. (See ADP 5-0 for doctrine on assessment.) 4-51. Throughout the operations process, commanders integrate their own assessments with those of the staff, subordinate commanders, and other unified action partners. Primary tools for assessing progress of operations include the operation order, the common operational picture (known as COP), personal observations, running estimates, and the assessment plan. The latter includes indicators for measures of effectiveness, measures of performance, and reframing criteria. The commander’s visualization forms the Battle Rhythm and Meetings 0D\ FM 6-0 4-21 basis for the commander’s personal assessment of progress. Running estimates provide information, conclusions, and recommendations from the perspective of each staff section. 4-52. Depending on the situation, particularly in protracted operations, commanders may develop a formal assessment plan to assist them in assessing the overall progress of the operations in achieving the desired end state. Whereas the battle update and commander’s update briefings focus on assessing current operations, the operations assessment board focuses on providing an assessment of the progress of operations for the mid- to long-range planning horizons. Areas of assessment include progress toward transitioning to the next phase of operations, achieving objectives, or obtaining end state conditions. (See FM 5-0 for more information on assessment plans.) 4-53. Chaired by the commander, representatives of each staff section, subordinate commands, and other organizations meet to assess the overall progress of operations. In addition to assessing progress, the board discusses what is working, what is not working, and how to improve operations. Based on the assessment, the commander may provide planning guidance at the end of the meeting or spend some time to think about the assessment before providing planning guidance. Key outputs from this meeting may include changes to the current plan resulting in a new operation order. Sample instructions for a division-level operation assessment board are listed in table 4-16.

G-3 assistant chief of staff, operations G-5 assistant chief of staff, plans Plans Synchronization Board 4-54. Planning is both a continuous and a cyclical activity of the operations process. While planning may start an iteration of the operations process, planning does not stop with the production of an order. During preparation and execution, the staff continuously refines the plan as the situation changes. (See ADP 5-0 for a doctrine on planning and the operations process. See FM 5-0 for details on the military decision-making process.) 4-55. At division and higher echelon headquarters, planning occurs in current operations, future operations, and the plans integrating cells. To synchronize these planning efforts and provide guidance on future planning, commanders convene a plans synchronization board. Typically chaired by the commander, Chapter 4 4-22 FM 6-0 0D\ members from the current operations, future operations, and plans cells meet to discuss the status of various planning efforts and receive guidance for future planning. Key outputs from this meeting include planning guidance (to include prioritization of planning efforts) and decisions required for continued planning. Sample instructions for a division-level plans synchronization board are listed in table 4-17. Note. The plans synchronization board is not a replacement for the required interaction between commanders and planners during planning. The situation dictates planning requirements to include the scheduling of planning events (for example, mission analysis, course of action approval, and operation order briefings) in the unit’s battle rhythm.

G-5 assistant chief of staff, plans Sustainment Board 4-56. Sustainment is the provision of logistics, financial and comptroller support, personnel services, and health service support necessary to maintain operations until successful mission completion. Sustainment units provide support through a support relationship (general support or direct support) to a supported unit. The supported commander clearly communicates concept of operations, intent, and priorities of support to supporting sustainment organizations. This enables supporting sustainment organizations to synchronize the planning of sustainment operations with the supported commander’s concept of operations. During execution, continuous coordination via reports, support requests, liaisons, update briefings, and sustainment- related working groups and boards ensure the supported unit is sustained throughout the operations. (See ADP 4-0 and FM 4-0 for more information on sustainment.) 4-57. The sustainment board, often called a log synchronization meeting, is a meeting conducted at division and higher echelons to provide oversight of broad sustainment functions, including approving guidance and sustainment priorities in accordance with the commander’s intent and concept of operations. Chaired by a deputy commander, the board approves recommendations from the sustainment working group (or other sustainment-related working group such as movements or maintenance).

Targeting is the process of selecting and prioritizing targets and matching the appropriate response to them, considering operational requirements and capabilities (JP 3-0). Targeting is a critical component of the fires warfighting function that seeks to create specific desired effects through lethal and nonlethal actions. (See ATP 3-60 for more information on targeting.) 4-59. Targeting begins in planning, and it is an interactive process that continues through preparation and execution using a methodology of decide, detect, deliver, and assess.Commanders convene a targeting board to approve products developed by the targeting working group and to issue targeting guidance for future planning. The commander’s targeting guidance describes the desired effects of fires, physical attack, CEMA, and other information-related capabilities against targets and target sets. Commanders also provide restrictions, including approving a no-strike list and restricted target list. Sample instructions for a division- level targeting board are listed in table 4-19 on page 4-24.

CONCLUSION 4-60. There is not a standard battle rhythm for every situation. Each commander has a unique personal decision-making style and staff interaction preference. Different echelons, types of units, and types of operations require commanders and staffs to develop their unit’s battle rhythm based on the situation. Unit standard operating procedures at every level of organization are vital to situational awareness and effective command and control. This page intentionally left blank. 0D\ FM 6-0 5-1 Chapter 5 Knowledge Management and Information Management This chapter focuses on conducting knowledge management and information management. It presents a model used to explain the progression of data to understanding. The chapter further discusses the specifics of knowledge management followed by a discussion on information management. Finally, it describes the interrelationship between knowledge management and information management. KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING 5-1. Success in operations demands timely and effective decisions based on applying judgment to available information and knowledge. Throughout the conduct of operations, commanders (supported by their staffs, subordinate commanders, and unified action partners) seek to build and maintain situational understanding. Situational understanding is the product of applying analysis and judgment to relevant information to determine the relationships among the operational and mission variables (ADP 6-0). 5-2. Commanders also strive to create shared understanding within the force and with unified action partners. Essential to command and control (C2) is the shared understanding and appreciation of the operational context and the commander’s intent by multiple participants. The shared understanding of an operational environment (known as OE), an operation’s purpose, the problem, and approaches to solving the problem form the basis for unity of effort and trust. This shared understanding is the context with which decentralized actions can be performed and commanders can exploit the critical component of initiative. Knowledge management helps create shared understanding by aligning people, processes, and tools within the organizational structure and culture to increase collaboration and interaction between leaders and subordinates. Knowledge management is a catalyst for shared understanding while it facilitates situational understanding. 5-3. Knowledge management and information management assist commanders with progressively adding meaning at each level of processing and analyzing to help build and maintain their situational understanding. These interrelated activities support the commander’s decision making. There are four levels of meaning. From the lowest level to the highest level, they include data, information, knowledge, and understanding. At the lowest level, processing transforms data into information. Analysis then refines information into knowledge. Commanders and staffs then apply judgment to transform knowledge into understanding. Commanders and staffs continue a progressive development of learning, as organizations and individuals assign meaning and value at each level. (See figure 5-1 for the four meanings.) Figure 5-1. Achieving understanding 5-4. In the context of decision making, data consists of unprocessed observations detected by a collector of any kind (human, mechanical, or electronic) (ADP 6-0). In most organizations, data flow from subordinate organizations to command posts (CPs). Subordinate units push data to inform higher echelon headquarters of events that facilitate situational understanding. Data can be quantified, stored, and organized in files and databases; however, data only become useful when processed into information. Chapter 5 5-2 FM 6-0 0D\ 5-5. Information is the meaning that a human assigns to data by means of the known conventions used in their representation. In the context of decision making, information is data that has been organized and processed in order to provide context for further analysis (ADP 6-0). Alone, information rarely provides an adequate basis for deciding and acting. Effective C2 requires developing information further into knowledge so commanders can achieve understanding. 5-6. In the context of decision making, knowledge is information that has been analyzed and evaluated for operational implications (ADP 6-0). It is also comprehension gained through study, experience, practice, and human interaction that provides the basis for expertise and skilled judgment. Staffs work to improve and share two types of knowledge, tacit and explicit. 5-7. Tacit knowledge resides in an individual’s mind. It is the domain of individuals, not technology. All individuals have a unique, personal store of knowledge gained from life experiences, training, and formal and informal networks of friends and professional acquaintances. This knowledge includes learned nuances and workarounds. Intuition, mental agility, effective responses to crises, and the ability to adapt are also forms of tacit knowledge. Leaders use tacit knowledge to solve complex problems and make decisions. They also routinely engage subordinates’ tacit knowledge to improve organizational learning and enhance unit innovation and performance. 5-8. Explicit knowledge consists of written or otherwise documented information that can be organized, applied, and transferred using digital (such as computer files) or nondigital (such as paper) means. Explicit knowledge lends itself to rules, limits, and precise meanings. Examples of explicit knowledge include dictionaries, official department publications (such as field manuals, technical manuals, and Department of the Army pamphlets), and memorandums. Explicit knowledge is primarily used to support situational awareness and shared understanding as it applies to decision making. 5-9. Understanding is knowledge that has been synthesized and had judgment applied to it to comprehend a situation’s inner relationships. Judgment is based on experience, expertise, and intuition. Ideally, true understanding should be the basis for decisions. However, commanders and staffs realize that uncertainty and time preclude achieving perfect understanding before deciding and acting. KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT 5-10. Knowledge management is the process of enabling knowledge flow to enhance shared understanding, learning, and decision making (ADP 6-0). Knowledge flow refers to the ease of movement of knowledge within and among organizations. Knowledge must flow to be useful. The purpose of knowledge management is to create shared understanding. By aligning people, processes, and tools in an organizational structure and culture, commanders increase collaboration and interaction between leaders and subordinates. This shared understanding results in better decisions and enables improved flexibility, adaptability, integration, and synchronization to achieve a position of relative advantage. Effective and efficient use of knowledge in conducting operations and supporting organizational learning are essential functions of knowledge management. Sound knowledge management practices include— z Collaboration among personnel at different locations. z Rapid knowledge transfer between units and individuals. 5-11. Knowledge management provides the methods and means to efficiently share knowledge among individuals and distribute relevant information where and when it is needed. Knowledge management creates, organizes, applies, transfers, collects, codifies, and exchanges knowledge and information between people. It seeks to align processes and people with appropriate tools so people can continuously capture, maintain, and re-use key information, decisions, and lessons learned. Knowledge management helps units learn and adapt to improve their mission performance. 5-12. Knowledge management leverages knowledge that resides in individuals and organizations. It facilitates the flow of knowledge across the organization and between organizations so units can apply knowledge to mission or operational requirements. Every Soldier must understand and practice knowledge management. It enables the Army and its subordinate commands at every level to be learning organizations. (For more information on knowledge management, see ATP 6-01.1.) Knowledge Management and Information Management 0D\ FM 6-0 5-3 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT COMPONENTS 5-13. Knowledge management is organized into four components. These components enable the understanding and visualization of leaders and develop shared understanding of subordinates. The four components are— z People. z Process. z Tools. z Organization. People 5-14. Of the four components, people are the most vital for successful knowledge management. Knowledge only has meaning in a human context, it moves between and benefits people, not machines. People include the commander and staff; higher echelon, lower echelon, and adjacent commanders and staffs; other Army leaders; and other partners that might contribute to answering information requirements. This includes those inside and outside the organization that create, organize, apply, and transfer knowledge and the leaders who act on that knowledge. 5-15. A key participant in knowledge management is the knowledge management officer (KMO). The KMO has a special role in knowledge management. Working through the chief of staff or executive officer, the KMO is responsible for developing the knowledge management plan that integrates and synchronizes knowledge management with information management. The KMO synchronizes knowledge and information management to facilitate the commander’s situational understanding of any problem set and to provide the staff shared understanding. The KMO accomplishes this by using the tools, processes, and people available to build an environment of shared understanding. For instance, the KMO assists the chief of staff or executive officer in CP design, the reporting standard operating procedure (SOP), the battle rhythm, and the working groups’ structure. Moreover, the KMO is concerned with sharing and disseminating knowledge and information inside and outside the organization. The KMO is the principal advisor who develops a plan, or blueprint, to facilitate situational and shared understanding of an operational environment, the problem, and approaches to solving the problem. 5-16. The KMO develops the knowledge management plan, and staffs execute the knowledge management plan. As part of execution, they develop and provide knowledge from which commanders and other decision makers achieve situational awareness and shared understanding, make decisions, and execute those decisions. Staffs are involved in both directing actions and assessing progress. The structure of personnel, units, and activities creates explicit communications channels for knowledge transfer within and between organizations. Note. While every unit has a KMO, every staff member has the position to understand and enforce knowledge management. Process 5-17. The five-steps in the knowledge management process are assess, design, develop, pilot, and implement. Its activities are integrated into the operations process used in the planning, preparing, executing, and assessing of operations. This integration enables the transfer of knowledge between and among individuals and organizations. Soldiers, groups, teams, and units employ them. Knowledge exchange occurs both formally, through established processes and procedures, and informally through collaboration and dialogue. The knowledge management process also seeks to ensure that knowledge products and services are relevant, accurate, timely, and usable to commanders and decision makers. (See ATP 6-01.1 for more information on the knowledge management process.) Assess 5-18. Assessment precedes all other steps. This step begins with determining what information leaders need to make decisions and how the unit provides information for those leaders. KMOs identify gaps in the Chapter 5 5-4 FM 6-0 0D\ process, and as they establish objectives, they begin to consider possible solutions to address those gaps. As solutions are implemented, staffs assess them to evaluate their effectiveness and to recommend new solutions or improvements. Design 5-19. Design is the second step in the knowledge management process. Design identifies tailored frameworks for knowledge management products or services that effectively and efficiently answer information requirements and achieve the objectives established in the assessment step. Services created in the design step are often shared through virtual communities that are established to share information on a certain topic. The knowledge management products or services could be refinements of an existing process or a new solution identified after the assessment The KMO assists in reorganizing the CP to develop situational and shared understanding. Note. The design step of the knowledge management process differs from and should not be confused with Army design methodology. (See ADP 5-0 and FM 5-0 for information on Army design methodology.) Develop 5-20. Develop is the step that actually builds the solution derived from the assessment and design steps. First, the KMO and the staff collaborate to establish the social framework for the virtual communities and other knowledge-sharing venues designed in the previous step. A social framework is the means by which individuals and organizations with a common interest can communicate with each other (such as through video and audio teleconferencing and messaging). Knowledge management representatives provide insight and advice on the social frameworks best suited to the organization. Once the social frameworks are established for the virtual communities, signal staff section personnel, usually portal administrators or designers, assist in connecting communities to the technical network. The knowledge management section works with the unit on both aspects of this step. (See ATP 6-01.1 for information on knowledge management representatives.) Pilot 5-21. Pilot is the step that deploys the knowledge management solution for tests and validation with a unit. This is incremental testing of a modification to an existing process or procedure. The pilot step includes communicating the proposed knowledge management plan to the commander and staff and ensuring acceptance or discussing alternatives as needed. The knowledge management section must be prepared to train and coach unit personnel, when needed, to successfully deploy and test the solution. Implement 5-22. Implement is the step that executes the validated knowledge management plan and integrates it into the unit information systems. The training and coaching of unit personnel, on their specific roles and tasks, will continue as needed. Knowledge managers within the staff sections monitor the initial implementation of the knowledge management plan and make any necessary adjustments.Once the knowledge management plan is fully implemented and integrated into the operations process, knowledge managers continue to monitor and assess results. Note. The steps of the knowledge management process and their associated activities are not ends in themselves. The knowledge management section uses them to improve knowledge management within the organization before operations, throughout the operations process, and after operations. The KMO synchronizes them with the unit’s battle rhythm. Knowledge Management and Information Management 0D\ FM 6-0 5-5 Tools 5-23. Throughout the process, the KMO uses tools that include information systems and various software used to put knowledge products and services into organized frameworks. Knowledge management tools are anything staffs use to share and preserve information. Commonly used tools include— z Information systems: The equipment and facilities that collect, process, store, display, and disseminate information. This includes computers—hardware and software—communications, and the policies and procedures for computer use. z Collaboration tools: These tools are information systems that include online capabilities that make team development and collaboration possible. Examples include chat, white-boarding, professional forums, communities of interest, communities of practice, and virtual teaming. z Expertise-location tools: These tools support finding subject matter experts. Often these consist of directories or databases of people listed by areas of expertise. z Data-analysis tools: These tools support data synthesis to identify patterns and establish relationships among data elements. z Search-and-discover tools: These tools look for topics, recommend similar topics, and show relationships to other topics. These include search engines such as the Army Publishing Directorate or the Army homepage search tools. z Expertise-development tools: These tools support developing experience, expertise, and judgment. Examples of expertise development tools include computer-generated constructive simulations, military gaming, and other three-dimensional, experiential knowledge-based unit tactical scenarios. Organization 5-24. Organizations are composed of people, processes, and tools that integrate individual and organizational knowledge and learning. Knowledge management capabilities contribute to the building of organizational knowledge and learning. This contribution enables leader understanding and visualization and develops shared understanding with subordinates. 5-25. Organizations bring values and behaviors together. These factors are its organizational culture. The culture of an organization provides the perspective by which information, the environment, and situations are viewed. The KMO analyzes the organizational culture to help the organization develop its knowledge management plan. This analysis allows for accurate interpretation and understanding. Note. When operating as a multinational organization, the unit has special considerations for the role of foreign disclosure in knowledge management. (See Appendix D and AR 380-10 for authorities, responsibilities, and policies regarding foreign disclosure and contact with foreign representatives.) KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT TASKS 5-26. Knowledge management tasks are critical to creating a sharing environment. The knowledge management tasks of creating knowledge, retaining knowledge, and transferring knowledge bring an organization closer to situational and shared understanding by enabling the C2 warfighting function, integrating the C2 system, and optimizing the operations process. Create Knowledge 5-27. Knowledge creation is the process of developing new knowledge or combining, restructuring, or repurposing existing knowledge in response to identified knowledge gaps. The more diverse the experience level within the organization, then the more it generates opportunities for deeper analysis, study, and ideas. Knowledge comes from various sources including new technology, answers to critical information requirements, or shared information. Chapter 5 5-6 FM 6-0 0D\ 5-28. Knowledge is created when organizations learn from experiences, which in turn enables the organizations to adapt. This is why after action reviews are a great tool. After a training event or operation, after action reviews bring together Soldiers to determine what happened, then compare what occurred to what should have happened. This comparison generates new ideas to improve performance and creates knowledge. Retain Knowledge 5-29. Knowledge retention focuses on the quantity or store of knowledge and methods to organize and apply it. It also refers to how effective a unit is in reusing the knowledge it has. Knowledge decays over time, or it is lost or forgotten (referred to as knowledge depreciation). Units aim to retain knowledge to ensure knowledge and its availability persist over time. Often units refer to this as organizational memory, which can be thought of as reservoirs or repositories where knowledge resides. Retaining knowledge requires managing knowledge and knowing where it resides, for example human experience, databases, routines, practices, and policies that govern operations. KMOs must understand this dynamic and not rely on a specific tool or a single database to find and share knowledge. Organizing Knowledge 5-30. Organizing knowledge includes archiving, labeling, and identifying. These are specific tasks of knowledge managers under the implement step of the knowledge management process. (See paragraph 5-22 for more on the implement step.) Organizing knowledge ensures that users can discover and retrieve knowledge that is relevant, and knowledge managers can track knowledge products throughout their life cycle. Archiving consists of moving outdated and irrelevant knowledge from active status to an inactive status based on rules and policies. Labeling takes content that is no longer relevant, archives it, and keeps it separate from current knowledge products. Identifying involves determining whether to archive or dispose of content. Subject matter experts do this by reviewing content that exceeds a specified date or does not meet usage benchmarks. Based on this review, subject matter experts determine whether regulations require retaining content or destroying it. Applying Knowledge 5-31. KMOs seek to create conditions so users can retrieve and apply the knowledge they need. A key aspect of knowledge management is ensuring that multiple users can easily retrieve knowledge products, which enables collaboration in applying knowledge. Disciplined archiving based on SOPs and enforced by the KMO will aid in retrieval. Transfer Knowledge 5-32. Knowledge transfer is the movement of knowledge—including knowledge based on expertise or skilled judgment—from one person to another. It is more than simply moving or transferring files and data. It describes how knowledge is passed between individuals and groups. It includes knowledge developed within a unit and received from other sources. Effective knowledge transfer allows all involved to build on each other’s knowledge in ways that strengthen not only an individual Soldier’s understanding, but also the entire organization’s understanding. Enable the Command and Control Warfighting Function 5-33. Knowledge management provides commanders with information and knowledge to create and maintain understanding and make decisions. During operations, knowledge flows among individuals, warfighting functions, and other organizations. Staffs manage this exchange and use knowledge management practices to enable knowledge transfer. Knowledge management enables the C2 warfighting function by— z Supporting the commander’s decision making throughout operations. z Facilitating dialogue and interaction using collaborative tools and processes. z Facilitating the capture and transfer of tacit and explicit knowledge shared in the organization. z Helping the staff provide timely and relevant information and knowledge. z Enabling adaptive learning organizations. z Supporting C2 warfighting function tasks. Knowledge Management and Information Management 0D\ FM 6-0 5-7 Integrate the Command and Control System 5-34. At every echelon, each commander establishes a C2 system. KMOs use the five-step knowledge management process to help commanders assess and organize their C2 system components. Commanders align three components—people, processes, and networks—in and between CP components. The knowledge management assessments provide a baseline from which to direct the organization’s knowledge management efforts and ensure effective alignment of the components of the system. Optimize the Operations Process 5-35. Knowledge management ensures relevant data, information, and knowledge are shared throughout the operations process. It assists the commander and staff in accessing and sharing information as they build their understanding of the operational context. As they plan, prepare, execute, and continuously assess the operation, knowledge management helps to provide the right information to the right person at the right time to facilitate learning and decision making. (For more information on the relationship between knowledge management and the operations process, see ATP 6-01.1.) INFORMATION MANAGEMENT 5-36. Information management is the science of using procedures and information systems to collect, process, store, display, disseminate, and protect data, information, and knowledge products (ADP 6-0). Information management supports, underpins, and enables knowledge management. The two are linked to facilitate understanding and decision making. Information management is a technical discipline that involves the planning, storing, manipulating, and controlling of information throughout its life cycle in support of the commander and staff. Information management employs both staff management and processes to make information available to the right person at the right time. Information management provides a structure so commanders and staffs can process and communicate relevant information and make decisions. Effective information management contributes to the knowledge management tasks of knowledge creation and supports shared understanding for all unit members. 5-37. Generally, information management relates to the tasks of collect, process, display, storage, distribute, and protect data and information. In contrast, knowledge management uses information to create, organize, apply, and transfer knowledge to support achieving understanding, making decisions, and ultimately taking effective action. The signal officer enables knowledge management by providing network architecture and technological tools to support content management and knowledge sharing. (For more information on content management and knowledge sharing, see ATP 6-01.1.) INFORMATION MANAGEMENT COMPONENTS 5-38. Information management is organized into two components, procedures and information systems. These two components facilitate the collecting, processing, storing, displaying, disseminating, and protecting knowledge and information. Information management provides the timely and protected distribution of relevant information to commanders and staff elements. It supports and is an interrelated activity with knowledge management. Procedures 5-39. The two primary procedures for information management are establishing information requirements and information categories. An information requirement is any information element the commander and staff require to successfully conduct operations. Information management begins by identifying information gaps and developing information requirements. Commanders and staffs may use tools such as mission variables and operational variables to categorize information. (See FM 5-0 for a discussion of mission and operational variables.) All information given to commanders should be relevant to answering their information requirements. Effective information management processes data into information for development into and use as knowledge as well as identifies and organizes relevant information. Information management then quickly routes information to those who need it. That is, commanders should only receive information that they need for exercising C2. Forces determine the relevance of information based on these characteristics: Chapter 5 5-8 FM 6-0 0D\ z Accurate—conveys the true situation. z Timely—arrives in time to make decisions. z Useable—is portrayed in common, easily understood formats and displays. z Complete—provides all necessary data. z Precise—has the required level of detail. z Secure—affords required protection. 5-40. As operations progress, commanders and staffs require additional information to gain further understanding and support decision making. Effective commanders and staffs prioritize the collection of required information. Doctrine organizes information requirements into two categories: commander’s critical information requirements (CCIRs) and the essential elements of friendly information (EEFIs). 5-41. A commander’s critical information requirement is an information requirement identified by the commander as being critical to facilitating timely decision making (JP 3-0). CCIRs are based on likely need for the commander to make specific decisions during the operation. CCIRs should change with the situation over time. Commanders will add and delete CCIRs as the situation changes. CCIRs fall into one of two categories: friendly forces information requirements (known as FFIRs) and priority intelligence requirements (known as PIRs). A CCIR is— z Specified by the commander for a specific operation. z Applicable only to the commander who specifies it. z Situation dependent and directly linked to a current or future mission. z Time-sensitive. 5-42. A friendly force information requirement is information the commander and staff need to understand the status of friendly force and supporting capabilities (JP 3-0). Friendly forces information requirements identify the information about the mission, troops and support available, and time available for friendly forces that the commander considers most important. In coordination with the staff, the operations officer manages friendly forces information requirements for the commander. 5-43. A priority intelligence requirement is an intelligence requirement that the commander and staff need to understand the threat and other aspects of the operational environment (JP 2-01). Priority intelligence requirements identify the information about the enemy, terrain and weather, and civil considerations that the commander considers most important. The intelligence officer manages priority intelligence requirements for the commander. 5-44. An effective C2 system anticipates and answers information requirements for the commander. Commanders carefully allocate collection resources to obtain data and information for critical tasks. They set priorities for collection by establishing the CCIRs. Commanders widely distribute their CCIRs and revise them as the situation changes. Staffs continuously collect information delivering it on a routine schedule or as requested. An information-push system pushes information from the source to the user as it becomes available or according to a schedule (such as through routine reports). An information-pull system supplies information as requested. Commanders and staffs determine how to use and integrate both types of systems. 5-45. An essential element of friendly information is a critical aspect of a friendly operation that, if known by a threat would subsequently compromise, lead to failure, or limit success of the operation and therefore should be protected from enemy detection (ADP 6-0). Although EEFIs are not CCIRs, they have the same priority. EEFIs establish an element of information to protect rather than one to collect. EEFIs identify those elements of friendly force information that, if compromised, would jeopardize mission success. EEFIs help commanders protect vital friendly information. Identifying EEFIs is the first step in the operations security process and central to the protection of information. Information Systems 5-46. Information systems are the physical dimension of information management. Staffs use automated systems for efficiently processing, storing, and disseminating information. Information systems—especially when merged into a single, integrated network—enable extensive information sharing. Effective information systems and processes make relevant information easy to share and easy for commanders to use. The staff’s Knowledge Management and Information Management 0D\ FM 6-0 5-9 goal is not to process vast amounts of information but to enable commanders to develop an accurate situational understanding as quickly as possible. 5-47. An effective way to communicate relevant information is the common operational picture. A common operational picture (COP) displays relevant information in a commander’s area of interest. The staff tailors the information to a user’s requirements. The COP integrates many digital information systems to display relevant information. Initially, commanders and staffs analyze their mission using operational and mission variables. They begin to develop the COP. Commanders determine their information requirements, and additional information is collected based on those requirements. Commanders and staffs continue to refer to and refine the COP as the situation evolves. They use the COP as a tool for developing knowledge and understanding. Commanders and staffs are obligated to share their understanding of the COP to subordinate and higher echelon commands to facilitate synchronized operations and parallel understanding. (See discussion beginning in paragraph 6-35 for more on the COP.) INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TASKS 5-48. The information management components are supported by six primary tasks to enable knowledge management and facilitate situational understanding and decision making. The six tasks are collect, process, store, display, disseminate, and protect. Collect 5-49. Data collection works to answer the CCIR. Collection describes compiling data based on those requirements. Through information dissemination management and content staging capabilities, producers of information can quickly accumulate data sensed or generated at the beginning of the information management process. Process 5-50. Processing information describes the act of cataloging data via established and usually routine sets of procedures to link or fuse it with other related data to create information. Information dissemination management and content staging capabilities enable the automated registering of data in order for data to be developed into information and stored until needed. Store 5-51. Storage of information describes the caching of information using any medium necessary. Storage provides the physical and virtual staging of information. Information regarding storage locations may be listed in unit SOPs or operation orders. Information dissemination management and content staging capabilities enable the digital caching of processed information in a secure system. Display 5-52. Display of information describes the visual presentation of collected information, data, or knowledge. Examples of displays include graphic control images, map boards, and the various electronic displays used in CPs. A display serves to enhance a user’s understanding of the status of operations by presenting data, information, and knowledge to the user in the required format. Disseminate 5-53.Disseminating information is a primary task for information management. Information dissemination management capabilities allow users to efficiently distribute or retrieve information from one person or place to another. Information dissemination takes one of these two forms: broadcast dissemination or point-to-point dissemination. Effective staffs use a combination of the two forms of information dissemination management activities to reach the many audiences with accurate information. Chapter 5 5-10 FM 6-0 0D\ Broadcast Dissemination 5-54. Broadcast dissemination allows senders to distribute information simultaneously to a large number of users. Anyone with access to the network can receive the information. The greatest advantage of this method is that information managers can disseminate information to the widest audience in the shortest amount of time. Since the information is sent to a variety of users with varying relevant information requirements, the information cannot be tailored to a specific commander’s needs. Another major drawback of broadcast dissemination is that undisciplined use of this method can quickly lead to information overload and potentially cause network congestion and latency when uploading or downloading large files. Point-to-point Dissemination 5-55. Point-to-point dissemination directs information to a specific user or users. Using this method, information can be easily passed from one commander to the next. The point-to-point dissemination method should be tailored to meet specific relevant information needs of each recipient. Each level of command can filter information, integrate information, and change it to meet the needs of the next level of command before passing it on. The major disadvantage of point-to-point dissemination is that information reaches a broad audience slowly, with a greater chance of distortion as it passes through the levels of command. Protect 5-56. For information producers and users, protection involves actions taken to counter threats and vulnerabilities during all steps of the information management process. Protection activities include encryption of data at rest, granting access to information on a need-to-share basis, and using secure, authorized processes to disseminate and display information. 5-57. Protection ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information traversing networks and residing on information systems. Protection begins from the time it is collected, processed, and stored and continues until it is discovered, distributed, and used by the users, systems, and decision makers. (See JP 6-0 and ATP 6-02.71 for more information on protect as an information management task.) KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT IN PRACTICE 5-58. Knowledge management and information management support execution through reporting, refinement of communications, and collaborative processes. Knowledge management and information management support learning by capturing available data, information, and knowledge from individuals and organizations. Knowledge that is used for daily work is usually a result of cross-functional staff analysis, coordination, recommendations, and decisions. This information is usually outputs from boards, workgroups, and individuals that is collated, standardized, and transferred for use. 5-59. Staffs use knowledge management and information management to extract knowledge from the vast amount of available information. Staffs provide this information to the commander as recommendations and running estimates. The information helps the commander build and maintain an understanding of the situation, make and implement decisions, control operations, and assess progress by providing timely and relevant information and analysis. 5-60. Effective staffs establish and maintain a high degree of coordination and cooperation with staffs of higher echelon; lower echelon; and supporting, supported, and adjacent units. They do this by actively collaborating with commanders and staffs of other units to solve problems and gain knowledge. During coordination, the KMO helps align the processes to the people, leading to identification of the proper tools, while the information management officer installs, operates, and maintains many of the identified tools. These tools help enable knowledge transfer. Tools can be large and complex like computer networks or simple like maps and overlay graphics. 5-61. Staffs apply the science of control to support the commander’s tasks by conducting knowledge management and information management activities. Knowledge management activities support improving organizational learning, innovation, and performance. Information management activities develop tools for the collection and distribution of timely and relevant information to commanders and staffs. Examples of knowledge and information activities include, but are not limited to— Knowledge Management and Information Management 0D\ FM 6-0 5-11 z Maintaining running estimates. z Completing requests for information. z Collecting and displaying important information (such as CCIRs and execution matrixes). z Synchronizing the unit’s battle rhythm with the higher headquarters’ battle rhythm. z Updating and sharing the COP. z Producing orders, plans, and reports. z Convening or participating in meetings to include boards and working groups. z Collaborating across communities of interest, communities of practice, and professional and functional forums. z Standardizing knowledge management and information management procedures. z Conducting after action reviews and applying lessons learned. z Identifying knowledge gaps in organizations and processes as well as applying knowledge management processes to develop solutions and streamline processes. z Supporting learning before, during, and after operations and training events. z Developing, piloting, establishing, and sustaining collaborative knowledge networks. z Developing and providing knowledge and information management policies and processes to facilitate knowledge capture, search, and dissemination. z Developing digital continuity books and websites. z Designing and administering knowledge networks and forums. 5-62. In practice, the KMO and signal officer work closely to fulfill the commander’s knowledge management needs. The chief of staff or executive officer is responsible for the knowledge management program, and the KMO is the principal advisor. A knowledge manager is anyone in the element helping to manage knowledge, not necessarily the KMO. The KMO focuses on the knowledge management plan to facilitate situational understanding for the commander and shared understanding for the unit. The signal officer focuses on the technical aspects to support the knowledge management plan. 5-63. The technical element of information management helps enable knowledge creation, transfer, and flow. An illustration of the differences between knowledge and information management functionality is a unit’s tactical web portal. The signal officer is normally responsible for the technical management of the tactical portal, while the KMO establishes policies and governance related to knowledge and information management. The KMO also provides the signal officer with an understanding of requirements related to connectivity, performance, security, and configuration control. CONCLUSION 5-64. Success in operations demands timely and effective decisions based on applying judgment to available information and knowledge. Staffs use knowledge management and information management to extract knowledge from the vast amount of information available. This management of knowledge and information assists commanders with processing and analyzing large amounts of information as well as helps to expedite situational understanding. Ultimately, these interrelated activities support the commander’s understanding and decision making for timely and effective decisions, which often lead to success in operations.

It discusses communications and information systems planning, to include developing primary, alternate, contingency, and emergency (PACE) communications plans. It concludes with a discussion on the common operational picture and how to conduct a communications rehearsal. COMMUNICATIONS 6-1. Communications are the means of exchanging information and ideas. Communications link information to decisions and decisions to action. Therefore, Army communications systems must be robust, redundant, and resilient across all domains to enable all operations. Commanders and staffs use communications systems to transmit information, ideas, and decisions to subordinates, adjacent units, higher echelon headquarters, and unified action partners throughout the conduct of operations. In developing an effective plan for communications that supports CP operations, the commander and staff must— z Provide for redundancy in communications by developing a plan for continuity of operations and a PACE plan. z Ensure subordinates know how to conduct operations in a disrupted communications environment. z Ensure standard operating procedures specify immediate actions in case of jamming, including prearranged frequencies to switch to and code words. z Avoid overloading the communications systems by practicing disciplined procedures that eliminate nonessential communications. (For more information on communications systems, see FM 6-02.) RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATIONS 6-2. The traditional responsibilities for establishing communications remain valid. However, with so many digital communications systems, all participants have roles that they must execute to establish and maintain communications. The traditional responsibilities are— z Higher to lower: A higher or senior unit must establish communications with a lower or subordinate unit. An attached unit of any size is considered subordinate to the command to which it is attached. z Supporting to supported: A supporting unit must establish communications with the supported unit. z Reinforcing to reinforced: A reinforcing unit must establish communications with the reinforced unit. z Passing to stationary: The passing unit must establish communications with the stationary unit during forward passage of lines. z Stationary to passing: The stationary unit must establish communications with the passing unit during a rearward passage of lines. z Lateral communications: The next higher commander establishes responsibility for establishing communications between adjacent units. If responsibility is not fixed by orders, the commander of the unit on the left must establish communications with the unit on the right. The commander of a unit positioned behind another unit establishes communications with the forward unit. Chapter 6 6-2 FM 6-0 0D\ Note. Regardless of traditional responsibilities for establishing communications, all organizations have the responsibility to establish and maintain communications throughout the operation. If a subordinate unit fails to establish communications with a senior unit, then it must activate an alternate form of communications from the directed PACE plan, or it must move to a location suitable to reestablish and maintain communications. Traditional responsibilities do not alleviate the responsibility to establish and maintain communications with the reporting chain of command. COMMAND POST COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES 6-3. The commander, with the assistance of the staff, determines communications capabilities that a CP requires during each phase of operations. Based on requirements, the G-6 or S-6 determines the appropriate mix of communications systems to use. Requirements exceeding the unit’s organic capabilities are fulfilled through augmentation that a unit requests through appropriate channels. Communications capabilities can be grouped in the following areas: z Voice communications. z Data communications. z Full motion video. Voice Communications 6-4. In most CPs, voice communications is the primary communications capability. Voice supports command and control (C2) on the move because it is fast, simple to use, and provides a reliable medium to quickly issue and receive reports and orders and to monitor ongoing operations. Voice communications can be transmitted using tactical radio (line of sight or beyond line of sight) or over data networks. An example of the voice capability over a data network is using a voice over Internet protocol (known as VoIP) phone. Data Communications 6-5. Data communications refers to the capability to exchange digital information between computers or other electronic devices over cable or wireless links. Data communications extends the CP’s access to classified and unclassified Defense Information Systems Network services and C2 user applications. This extended access enables CPs to conduct coordination and efficiently share various forms of digital information. Examples of these services are email, information dissemination portals, video teleconferencing, and chat applications. Full Motion Video 6-6. Full motion video describes the capability in a CP that provides enhanced situational awareness with near real time video and telemetry data from multiple manned and unmanned platforms. An example of this capability is found in the One System Remote Video Terminal. The One System Remote Video Terminal allows a CP to remotely downlink streaming video, images, and critical geospatial data from tactical manned and unmanned aircraft. COMMAND POST COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS 6-7. A CP relies on a combination of communications systems and networks that collectively provide the required capabilities and enable C2. It is important that all CP personnel be familiar with the capabilities and limitations of the components of the communications systems. These components include— z Tactical radios. z Data networks. z C2 information systems. z C2 on-the-move packages. Networks and Command Post Communications 0D\ FM 6-0 6-3 Tactical Radios 6-8. Commands deploy tactical radios at all echelons. These radios provide users the capability to conduct interoperable voice communications. Tactical radios use high frequency, ultrahigh frequency, and very high frequency bands; satellite communications; and multiband radios. The equipment is typically designed for military use but may include commercial off-the-shelf radios. Each radio has unique capabilities and characteristics that commanders employ depending on the mission and other factors. Tactical radios can be accessed through the AN/TSQ-259 Communication Subsystem and voice over Internet protocol communications. Data Networks 6-9. Commanders rely on data networks in the CP to communicate information and control forces. These networks facilitate information flow by connecting information users and information producers to enable effective and efficient information flow. The tactical internet is the deployed communications data network. The tactical internet is functionally similar to the commercial internet, because the communications infrastructure uses the same technologies. The tactical internet extends home-station quality classified and unclassified Defense Information Systems Network (known as DISN) services and C2 applications to deployed units. At brigades and lower echelons, the tactical internet extends voice and data communications to Soldiers and weapons platforms. From a management standpoint, the tactical internet is divided into two logical segments or tiers: the upper tier tactical internet and the lower tier tactical internet. Upper Tier Tactical Internet 6-10. Upper tier tactical internet supports battalion and above for CP operations on the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (known as NIPRNET), SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network (known as SIPRNET, and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (known as JWICS). At the division, brigade combat team, and battalion levels, the upper tier tactical internet consists of resources that provide networking on-the-move and at-the-halt. At the corps headquarters and support brigades, this capability for networked services is used at-the-halt only. 6-11. The upper tier is connected through the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (known as WIN-T) and provides the gateway capability between the upper and lower tiers. It is an interoperability point for higher echelons, aviation integration, and joint, interorganizational, and multinational elements. Upper tier tactical internet connects deployed users to a data center and Defense Information Systems Network services, regardless of their location. The deployed enclave connects to the Department of Defense information network-A and Defense Information Systems Network services through the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical gateway through a regional hub node or tactical hub node. (For more information on upper tier tactical internet, see ATP 6-02.45 and ATP 6-02.71.) Lower Tier Tactical Internet 6-12. Lower tier tactical internet runs on single-channel radios and retransmission to support the brigade and lower echelons down to the team leader level. It consists primarily of secure radio networks at platoons and companies. The primary lower tier waveforms are the Soldier radio and the single-channel ground and airborne radio system waveforms. 6-13. The lower tier tactical internet provides transport for operational data information, such as email and chat. Additional mobile applications enable visualization, operator interface with ancillary devices (such as Global Positioning System), targeting data, voice communications, and sensor capability. Warfighter Information Network-Tactical’s combat net radio gateway provides the bridge to connect the lower tier tactical internet through combat net radio (voice) networks to the upper tier. (For more information on lower tier tactical internet, see ATP 6-02.53 and ATP 6-02.71.) Command and Control Information Systems 6-14. C2 information systems collect, process, store, display, and disseminate information. The primary purpose of C2 information systems is to enhance situational understanding, facilitate timely and accurate decision making, and expedite execution through efficient processing and managing of information. The Chapter 6 6-4 FM 6-0 0D\ inventory of C2 information systems in a CP depends on the type of unit and its primary mission. The commander and staff have a multitude of applications available. Some are warfighting function immaterial and others are specific to staff sections, which provide the commander with an increased information capability. However, this capability comes with requirements that include the responsibility to train Soldiers and leaders in the capabilities available to them and the ways the capabilities integrate to assist the commander during the conduct of continuous operations.6-15. Commanders should determine their critical information requirements and focus their staffs and organizations on using C2 information systems to meet these requirements. Staffs use C2 information systems to process, store, and disseminate information according to the commander’s priorities. These capabilities relieve the staff of handling routine data. C2 information systems—especially when merged into a single and integrated network—enable extensive information sharing and situational understanding. 6-16. C2 information systems are located in various CPs from battalion to corps echelons. These locations range from the ground force commanders at the joint task force level to the individual Soldier or weapons platform. C2 information systems support the mission by integrating communications and automation systems to link functionally strategic and tactical headquarters. Paragraphs 6-17 through 6-33 list common C2 information systems that can be found in CPs at most echelons. Battle Command Common Services 6-17. The Battle Command Common Services suite connects the C2 end-user applications within a CP. This suite provides interoperability services, information services infrastructure, and tactical enterprise services to CPs at multiple echelons. The Battle Command Common Services suite provides collaboration servers, databases, file servers, websites, and email. The suite uses virtual machines to provide these services. The G- 6 or S-6 section typically installs, operates, and maintains the Battle Command Common Services suite. Global Broadcast Service 6-18. Global Broadcast Service is a one-way wideband transmission broadcast, supporting timely delivery of video and data products. It provides a CP with imagery, intelligence, maps, weather, biometric data, and near real time streaming video and telemetry data from multiple manned and unmanned platforms for enhanced situational awareness. Global Command and Control System-Army 6-19. Global Command and Control System-Army (known as GCCS-A) is the system responsible for managing the higher echelon common operational picture (COP). It is typically found in a movement and maneuver cell at division through corps echelons. The Global Command and Control System-Army is the theater and Army component commander’s C2 system. Command Post of the Future 6-20. The command post of the future (CPOF) is a type of integrated C2 software system and work station typically found in CPs at battalion through corps and in multiple cells, based on unit modified table of organization and equipment (known as MTOE). CPOF is a digital C2 system used for planning, monitoring, and controlling tactical operations and for collaboration between CPs. CPOF is sometimes referred to as the Army C2 workstation. It supports parallel, synchronous, and asynchronous planning among and between echelons. CPOF is currently fielded to battalions and higher echelons but can be found as low as company level. CPOF is the primary COP viewer used by Army forces in all theaters of operations. This system feeds from different C2 end-user applications to provide a broad range of information that commanders and Soldiers can use to collaborate. CPOF applications allow commanders to receive real-time situational awareness from the system and have that information in text and graphic representation to share with other commanders and operations officers at all echelons. Its tools allow users to unobtrusively view other users’ workspaces, copy and track information requirements, and begin parallel planning without having to request information. 6-21. Used effectively, efficiently, and combined with a clear and widely disseminated unit standard operating procedure, integrated C2 end-user applications allow units to share and display a COP that enables Networks and Command Post Communications 0D\ FM 6-0 6-5 commanders to achieve unprecedented levels of understanding and a commonly understood, systemic means to describe and direct operations. It is important that commanders ensure that battle captains, battle staff noncommissioned officers, and a knowledge management representative have had system-specific training and preferably have attended the Mission Command Digital Master Gunner’s Course. Note. CPOF is scheduled to be replaced by the command post computing environment (known as CPCE) in the near term. The command post computing environment will retain much of the same functionality that CPOF has today. Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System 6-22. The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) is used for planning, coordinating, controlling, and executing fires and effects such as mortars, field artillery cannons, rockets and missiles, close air support, attack aviation, and naval surface fire-support systems. AFATDS also acts as a fire support server to local area network-based and tactical internet-based clients, including AFATDS Effects Management Tool, and the U.S. Marine Corps Command and Control Personal Computer. AFATDS publishes fire support unit locations, target data, and fire support coordination measures. Its operators, all field artillery personnel, are trained at echelon in its use. AFATDS is fielded down to artillery firing platoon level and can be used on- the-move or at-the-halt. Air and Missile Defense Workstation 6-23. The air and missile defense workstation (known as AMDWS) provides a common air and missile defense planning, staff planning, and situational awareness tool to air defense and other Army units at all echelons. It is the air and missile defense component of Army Battle Command Systems, and it is used for posting air threat warnings. It receives real-time air and missile defense situational awareness from the forward area air defense C2. For commanders, the air and missile defense workstation provides a visual three- dimensional airspace picture with near real-time air tracks. For air defense airspace management or brigade aviation elements, the air and missile defense workstation enables them to parse and graphically display the airspace control order and airspace coordinating measures. The combination of the air and missile defense element’s air tracks and the airspace element’s airspace control overlay displayed on airspace element system screens and in the current operations provides the echelon commander a tactical air picture and situational awareness of ongoing airspace use. Distributed Common Ground System-Army 6-24. Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) is a system that provides Army intelligence analysts in the CP with access to tactical, operational, and strategic information and products from the joint coalition and intelligence communities to enable the commander to make informed decisions. DCGS-A is a group of systems that includes fixed sites, deployable ground stations, and unit equipment (including servers and laptops) that provide enterprise data access which supports C2 and integrates with end-user applications through the full range of military operations. DCGS-A supports continuous CP operations and provides a persistent and dynamic view of an operational environment. DCGS-A does this by providing access to relevant geospatial, weather, single, multi- and all-source fused information and intelligence on the threat and nonaligned forces to support the CP COP. DCGS-A simultaneously supports integrating cells within the CP. DCGS-A can operate across all echelons and all security and network domains, including coalition networks. The core functions of DCGS-A are tasking of sensors; controlling select Army sensor systems; processing, fusing, and exploiting data and information; supporting knowledge generation; providing ground station capabilities; providing automated support to intelligence product generation; disseminating information and intelligence about the threat, weather, and terrain at all echelons; automating intelligence synchronization, including information collection planning; providing reconnaissance and surveillance integration and assessment; supporting situational understanding; and supporting targeting and effects. Chapter 6 6-6 FM 6-0 0D\ Tactical Airspace Integration System 6-25. Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) is at brigade through corps echelons as a digitized, integrated battlefield management and decision support system designed to facilitate the echelon commander’s role in the air battle. TAIS supports the echelon by automating Army airspace control planning and operations and air traffic services. TAIS also provides the vital link to the theater battle management core systems. It helps the brigade aviation element build echelon input for the joint air tasking order and airspace control order, and it distributes the approved airspace control overlay. TAIS is one of the primary battlefield automation systems of the Army Battle Command Systems. Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade and Below: Blue Force Tracking and Joint Capabilities Release 6-26. Force XXI Battle Command, brigade and below’s (FBCB2’s) blue force tracking (BFT) and Joint Capabilities Release (known as JCR) are designed to support commanders at lower echelons with real-time situational awareness, position location information, target identification, and graphic combat area displays. These systems’ situational awareness component displays the geographic location of all weapons, platforms, Soldiers, CPs, and other facilities based on actual locations reported automatically by system subscribers in near-real time. Operating at division and higher echelons, these systems collect information from both the operations center and the individual units, process a COP, and disseminate it to all echelons, thus improving situational awareness, coordination, combined operations, and support. 6-27. FBCB2 BFT and FBCB2 Joint Capabilities Release manage situational awareness and situational understanding down to the individual platform level. Each platform using BFT is equipped with a Global Positioning System receiver and L-band transceiver for satellite communications, giving beyond line-of-sight networking. The distribution of systems per platform is based on unit modified table of organization and equipment. A tactical operations center kit operations box is found in CPs at battalion through corps echelons, and it is found in multiple cells based on unit modified table of organization and equipment. The remote kit is an additional authorized item that enables a vehicle-mounted system to be employed to increase the number of CP systems available and facilitating the rapid displacement of the CP. Note. The Joint Battle Command Platform (known as JBC-P) is currently being fielded Army wide to replace legacy FBCB2 systems. The Joint Battle Command Platform will retain much of the same functionality that FBCB2 users have today. Global Broadcast System 6-28. The Global Broadcast System, found in the intelligence cell at brigade through corps echelons, operates as a one-way, wideband transmission service capable of supporting timely delivery of classified and unclassified data and information products for mission support and theater information transfer. The Global Broadcast System disseminates internet protocol-based real-time video and large data files (up to 4 gigabytes in size) over the air (30 megabits per second per transponder) to garrisoned and deployed combat forces using smart push and user pull information based on unit mission reception priority profiles. Defense Collaboration Service 6-29. Defense Collaboration Service, a web-based service, is the designated Department of Defense and Army enterprise tool for worldwide synchronous and asynchronous collaboration for both the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (known as NIPRNET) and SECRET Internet Protocol Routing Network (known as SIPRNET). Defense Collaboration Service is available to all Department of Defense partners, allowing users to communicate and share information in a secure forum through the use of instant messaging, low-bandwidth text chat, and web conferencing (audio and video). Chat Applications 6-30. Chat applications provide the ability to conduct an online texting conversation in near real time. These are server based systems for synchronous or near-synchronous conversation; therefore, they have minimal lag or delay. Commonly referred to as chat or instant message, they also provide users with the ability to Networks and Command Post Communications 0D\ FM 6-0 6-7 multi-task conversations with other duties. Chat applications can supplement radio networks during ongoing high-intensity operations or be used from a vehicle-based BFT if transitioning, setting up, or tearing down a CP, or when a CP is in transit. Video Teleconferencing 6-31. Video teleconferencing capabilities provide the capability to communicate visually with audio, either point to point or between several linked stations. Video teleconferences allow for quick updates, briefings, and planning. The speed and clarity this provides commanders and their staffs make it a useful tool for coordination between echelon CPs. Email 6-32. Email is a method of exchanging digital messages, with or without attachments, from an author to one or more recipients. Modern email operates across the internet or other computer networks. Collaboration Portal 6-33. Collaboration portals and intranet portal services, such as SharePoint, offer browser-based collaboration and documentation platforms. Staff can use them to host websites for access-shared workspaces, documents, and specialized applications like wikis and blogs. Staff should not use them as a share drive due to storage space limitations. Command and Control On-the-Move Packages 6-34. C2 on-the-move packages enable the commander and Soldiers to be present at the decisive point on the battlefield, provide the relevant COP, and enable situational awareness while on the move. On-the-move capabilities provide commanders the freedom to place themselves at the most critical place on the battlefield without being tethered to the CP. A C2 equipment package is typically integrated into M2 Bradley, M1126 Stryker, or a mine-resistant ambush protected platform. COMMON OPERATIONAL PICTURE 6-35. The common operational picture is a display of relevant information within a commander’s area of interest tailored to the user’s requirements and based on common data and information shared by more than one command (ADP 6-0). Through a shared visual workspace, commanders and staffs can monitor operations, analyze data, share thoughts, and plan courses of action. 6-36. The COP is maintained by the current operations cell as the primary tool that supports each of the C2 activities performed as part of the operations process. Incorporating a relevant and comprehensive COP into a CP provides the advantages to the operations process. The COP— z Assists the commander in providing intent and issuing planning guidance. z Helps the commander, staff, and subordinate leaders focus on relevant information for an operation. z Enhances collaboration and thus allows more efficient planning, directing, and backbriefs. z Promotes subordinate unit parallel planning. z Reduces the need for production of extensive control measures to coordinate maneuver. z Helps ensure that rules of engagement are disseminated uniformly down to the lowest echelons. z Allows for rapid response to the evolving tactical situation and allows commanders to make the right decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and seize and retain the initiative. z Reduces the risk of fratricide with enhanced situational understanding. z Supports the commander who is rapidly communicating changes for ongoing operations. z Promotes better battle tracking and helps leaders measure, analyze, and report unit performance during operations. z Promotes parallel planning and staff focus on the commander’s critical information requirements. z Supports the planning of branches and sequels to react to anticipated change. Chapter 6 6-8 FM 6-0 0D\ 6-37. A technique for establishing an effective COP is to develop a standard operating procedure checklist for what items staff display on the COP. The checklist should include only relevant information which is intuitive to the user and tailored to the user’s requirements. (See table 6-1 for an example of a COP checklist.) Table 6-1. Example common operational picture checklist Number Items checked 1. Unit boundaries and current locations within the AO 2. Maneuver graphics 3. Active and planned fire support coordination measures 4. Active and on-order airspace coordination measures 5. Irregular hostile forces and asymmetric threats 6. Sustainment nodes and MSRs 7. Civil considerations 8. Known and templated threats, hazards, enemy locations, and enemy activities 9. Adversary information operations 10. Host-nation and political considerations AO area of operations MSR main supply route COMMUNICATIONS PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 6-38. Planning for successful communications while operating in a CP environment is increasingly complex and requires detailed planning by every staff member, not just the G-6 or S-6. Communications planners must understand the commander’s intent, understand the concept of operations, and have a clear picture of the overall communications architecture. The G-6 or S-6 conducts planning as part of the military decision- making process when the unit receives the warning order. The G-6 or S-6 coordinates with all elements involved in the operation. CP communications planning considers— z Communications capability requirements for all CP warfighting functions. z Capabilities and limitations of all available end-user applications. z Potential joint, interorganizational, and multinational communications requirements. z Detailed line-of-sight analysis. z Redundancy (PACE) in means to communicate. z Integration of all available signal assets.z Method of deployment so assets are sequenced to coincide with the arrival of forces. z Locations of all CP communications systems. z The use of retransmission, digital network links, and node placement. z Satellite communications requirements. z Spectrum requirements for emitters, sensors, radars, or any other assets that rely on a frequency. z Initial task organization and expected changes. z Proper signal and communications security procedures. z Conducting communications rehearsals. z Conducting cybersecurity activities. z Enemy situation and threats. PRIMARY, ALTERNATE, CONTINGENCY, AND EMERGENCY PLANS 6-39. A PACE communications plan is a key requirement for communications planning. A PACE plan establishes primary, alternate, contingency, and emergency methods of communications for each warfighting function, typically from higher to lower echelons. Establishing a PACE plan requires that an alternate or contingency method of communications does not rely on the primary method. For example, having voice over Internet protocol as an alternate method of communications would be a poor choice if the primary is network data, because when the primary is down, the alternate may be as well. The key to a good PACE plan Networks and Command Post Communications 0D\ FM 6-0 6-9 is to establish redundancy so that communications never drop. Most units will have two PACE plans: one for communications to its higher echelon headquarters and one for subordinate units. A PACE plan for a higher headquarters will likely be established by the higher headquarters. 6-40. Staffs should keep the PACE plan as simple as possible yet flexible enough to provide reliable communications during dynamic operations. PACE plans should, if possible, revolve around warfighting functions. This assists units in delineating differences in reporting requirements for each warfighting function as each function reports, receives, and processes information differently from the other. There are four principal warfighting functions for the purposes of PACE planning: movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, and sustainment. The G-6 or S-6 does not dictate PACE plans for these warfighting functions. However, the G-6 or S-6 does educate the warfighting function leads on available capabilities during operations and assists the warfighting function lead in formulating a PACE plan. 6-41. Units identify appropriate PACE plans for information systems in each phase of the operation and publish those plans in the Annex H (Signal). An emergency means of communications does not always have to be equipment. It may be a procedure, such as moving back to the last known effective communications point or linking up at a grid coordinate. This a valuable tool to ensure there is a backup communications plan in place. Table 6-2 shows an example of a PACE plan that aligns with warfighting functions. Table 6-2.

Bandwidth management is the process of measuring and controlling the communications traffic on a data network link to avoid filling the link to capacity, which typically results in high latency, network congestion, and poor network performance. In short, bandwidth management allows the use of bandwidth to be protected or limited for a given class of applications. 6-43. If leaders take proactive measures at all levels, units typically have sufficient bandwidth available to support necessary staff interaction and CP operations. To manage bandwidth, commanders and staffs consider— z Establishing clear guidance as to when to send information throughout the network. Particular attention should be paid to critical phases of an operation. z Establishing firm guidelines, positive control, and clear priorities on using collaborative sessions. z Involving the G-6 or S-6 and knowledge management officer in bandwidth management. z Sending messages and data only to recipients who truly require the information. z Forcing users to download documents from a server or website (a “pull system”) rather than sending documents directly to many recipients (a “push system”). z Using zip files or converting documents to Adobe Portable Document Format (known as PDF) rather than transmitting common application files (for example, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). z Anticipating periods when network activity is lowest and establishing reporting deadlines during those periods. z Avoiding requirements for reports to be due during high-usage periods. z Transmitting graphics, imagery, and briefing slides only when essential. If text will suffice, use it instead. Chapter 6 6-10 FM 6-0 0D\ z Transmitting a graphic in the following priority of formats: graphics interchange format (known as GIF), joint photographic experts group (known as JPEG), bitmap (known as BMP), or tagged image file format (known as TIFF). If receivers need a high clarity images, senders reverse this priority. z Enforcing net discipline. Users must remember that the tactical internet is for combat operations and not for personal nonmission-related communications. z Establishing unit standard operating procedures that economize bandwidth usage. COMMUNICATIONS REHEARSAL 6-44. A communications rehearsal describes an orchestrated test of all the communications platforms within a CP to ensure operators understand their systems, capabilities, and limitations prior to conducting operations. The communications rehearsal allows signal personnel and the CP warfighting functions to validate their systems’ data information flow; verify switch and router configurations; and verify all systems in the unit’s communications PACE plan are available and functional and all personnel understand the triggers to change from one means of communications to another. (See Appendix C for more information on rehearsals.) 6-45. Commanders and staffs ensure that all end-user applications (both voice and digital) are installed; have been checked for completeness, serviceability, and operability; and are deemed fully operational prior to conducting a rehearsal. Units publish a detailed timeline with instructions, systems to be used, and measures to verify functionality of Annex H (Signal) of the operation order (known as OPORD) before executing the communications rehearsal.

Army forces must accurately and quickly shoot, move, and communicate. Shooting and moving are exceptionally difficult without communicating. Failure to effectively communicate in a timely manner may result in the unnecessary loss of lives and materiel and mission failure. Communications is essential to C2, and effective C2 of friendly forces is among the greatest strengths of the U.S. military. Friendly forces must have a reliable PACE plan with redundant means of communications. All personnel must anticipate problems and devise solutions. End-user applications will change over time, but the basic concepts of effective C2 will remain consistent.

It further discusses the types of CPs by echelon and unit while also providing considerations for effective CP organization and employment. The chapter concludes with multinational considerations for effective CP operations. DEFINITION AND FUNCTIONS 7-1. A command post is a headquarters, or a portion there of, organized for the exercise of command and control. When necessary, commanders control operations from other locations away from the CP. In all cases, the commander alone exercises command when in a CP or elsewhere. 7-2. CPs provide a physical location for people, processes, and networks to directly assist commanders as they understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead, and assess operations. CPs can vary in size, complexity and focus, such as the main CP or the tactical CP. CPs may be composed of vehicles, containers, and tents, or located in buildings. 7-3. Commanders systematically arrange platforms, operation centers, signal nodes, and support equipment in ways best suited for a particular operational environment. Examples of equipment needed to sustain a CP include vehicles, radio or signal equipment, generators, and lighting. Functions common to all CPs include— z Conducting knowledge management, information management, and foreign disclosure. z Building and maintaining situational understanding. z Controlling operations (by coordinating, synchronizing, and integrating). z Assessing operations. z Coordinating with internal and external organizations. z Performing CP administrative activities. 7-4. Effective command and control (C2) requires continuous, and often immediate, close coordination, synchronization, and information sharing across staffs and warfighting functions for directing activities. To promote this, commanders organize their staffs and other components of the C2 system into CPs to assist them in effectively conducting specific operations. Different types of CPs—such as the main CP, the tactical CP, or the rear CP—have specific functions by design. CONDUCTING KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, AND FOREIGN DISCLOSURE 7-5. Both the knowledge management and signal staff sections in CPs assist the commander and other staff members in developing and implementing effective knowledge and information management plans. All members of the staff have a responsibility to work as part of the knowledge management team. (See Chapter 5 for further information on knowledge management. See ATP 6-01.1 for detailed doctrine on assessing, designing, developing, piloting, and implementing knowledge management solutions.) 7-6. Developing and managing the unit’s battle rhythm is a key aspect of knowledge management. The unit’s battle rhythm establishes those boards, working groups, and planning teams necessary to assist the commander and staff with integrating the warfighting functions, coordinating activities, and making effective decisions throughout the operations process. The battle rhythm arranges the sequence and timing of reports, meetings, and briefings based on the commander’s preference, higher echelon headquarters’ requirements, Chapter 7 7-2 FM 6-0 0D\ and the type of operations. There is no standard battle rhythm for all units. Depending on echelon and type of operations, the commander and staff develop and adjust their battle rhythm based on the situation. 7-7. Managed by the chief of staff (COS) or executive officer (XO), the unit’s battle rhythm facilitates decision making and routine interactions among commanders, staffs, forces, and unified action partners. (See Chapter 4 for a more detailed discussion of battle rhythm.) 7-8. Military operations conducted in the multidomain environment throughout large-scale combat operations involve not only joint but also international partners. Effective sharing of information and knowledge management is critical to success. (See Appendix D for a detailed discussion of foreign disclosure requirements and techniques.) BUILDING AND MAINTAINING SITUATIONAL UNDERSTANDING 7-9. Effective knowledge management and information management are essential to building and maintaining situational understanding. Building and maintaining situational understanding helps in establishing the context surrounding the situation at hand, developing effective plans, assessing operations, and making quality decisions during execution. Commanders and staffs continually strive to maintain their situational understanding and work through periods of reduced understanding as a situation evolves. Effective commanders accept that uncertainty can never be completely eliminated, and they train their staffs and subordinates to function in uncertain environments. CP activities that contribute to situational understanding include— z Maintaining running estimates to support the commander’s decision making by—  Receiving information, including reports from subordinate units.  Analyzing information. z Generating, distributing, and sharing information and knowledge products, including reports required by higher echelon headquarters. z Conducting battle tracking. z Conducting update and information briefings. 7-10. As commanders and staffs build their situational understanding, they share their understanding across the force and with unified action partners. Creating shared understanding requires communication and information sharing from higher to lower echelons, lower to higher echelons, and laterally. Higher headquarters ensure subordinates understand the larger situation, including the operation’s end state, purpose, and objectives. Staffs from lower echelons share their understanding of their particular situation and provide feedback to the higher echelon headquarters on the operation’s progress. Communication and information sharing with adjacent units and unified action partners is also multi-directional. Staff members maintain running estimates in support of the commander’s decision making and communicate those estimates as appropriate. 7-11. Running estimates and the common operational picture (COP) are key products used for building and maintaining situational understanding.A running estimate is the continuous assessment of the current situation used to determine if the current operation is proceeding according to the commander’s intent and if planned future operations are supportable (ADP 5-0). CP cells, staff sections, and warfighting function cells continuously consider the effects of new information. In their running estimates, command post cells and staff sections integrate new information and update— z Facts. z Assumptions. z Friendly force status. z Enemy activities and capabilities. z Civil considerations. z Conclusions and recommendations with associated risk. (See FM 5-0 for a detailed description of running estimate requirements.) 7-12. The staff uses running estimates to advise the commander and make recommendations. Information in running estimates also helps build the COP. Maintaining the COP within a CP and with other CPs assists Command Posts 0D\ FM 6-0 7-3 commanders and staffs in maintaining situational understanding and promoting a shared understanding throughout the command. The level of detail provided in the COP varies for each level of command. (See Chapter 6 for additional information on the COP.) CONTROLLING OPERATIONS 7-13. Controlling is regulating forces and warfighting functions to accomplish the mission in accordance with the commander’s intent. Personnel in CPs assist commanders in controlling operations, including coordinating, synchronizing, and integrating actions within their delegated authority. They also integrate and synchronize resources in accordance with the commander’s priority of support. Staff members monitor and evaluate the progress of operations and make or recommend adjustments to operations following the commander’s intent. While all CPs assist the commander in controlling operations, different CPs have specific control responsibilities assigned. For example, a brigade commander may employ the brigade tactical CP to control battalion air assault operations. 7-14. Language used in controlling operations should be simple, clear, and easily understood. Using doctrinal terms and graphics shortens the amount of explicit communication needed to convey or explain an order or plan and promote mutual understanding throughout the force. (See FM 1-02.2 for approved Army symbols and FM 1-02.1 for Army terms used during the conduct of operations.) ASSESSING OPERATIONS 7-15. Personnel in CPs continuously assess operations. Assessment is the determination of the progress toward accomplishing a task, creating a condition, or achieving an objective (JP 3-0). Assessment involves deliberately comparing forecasted outcomes with actual events to determine the overall effectiveness of force employment. More specifically, assessment helps commanders and staffs in determining progress toward attaining the desired end state, achieving objectives, and performing tasks. It also involves continuously monitoring and evaluating an operational environment to determine which changes might affect the conduct of operations. (See ADP 5-0 for a detailed discussion of assessment.) 7-16. Commanders assign aspects of assessing the operations to different CPs and specific cells and staff sections within a CP. For example, the intelligence cell within a main CP is responsible for battle damage assessment. The protection cell is normally responsible for risk assessment. The detailed analysis and assessment of the overall progress of operations belongs to a unit’s main CP. COORDINATING WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS 7-17. Units do not operate in isolation. They synchronize their actions with those of others. Coordination is essential to this synchronization. Personnel in CPs continuously coordinate with higher echelon units, lower echelon units, adjacent units, supporting units, supported units, and unified action partners. Coordination helps— z Develop shared understanding and trust. z Ensure a thorough understanding of the commander’s intent and concept of operations. z Inform an organization on issues so that it may adjust plans and actions as required. z Avoid conflict and duplication of effort among units. 7-18. CP personnel continuously plan for and coordinate information collection, security, protection, terrain management, and airspace control. Sending and receiving liaison teams, establishing and maintaining communications, and exchanging standard operating procedures (SOPs) all facilitate effective coordination with other units and unified action partners. (See Chapter 3 for additional details on liaison teams.) PERFORMING COMMAND POST ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES 7-19. Commanders’ staff, equip, and organize CPs to control operations for extended periods. CP personnel use information systems and equipment to support 24-hour operations. As such, units must protect and sustain CP personnel and equipment. To do this, the CP requires and conducts its own rhythm of CP administration activities such as generator refueling, meal times, and equipment maintenance to maintain the CP as a facility that fully supports the commander and staff. This rhythm must be synchronized with the unit battle rhythm Chapter 7 7-4 FM 6-0 0D\ by the headquarters battalion or company at echelons battalion and above, or by the first sergeant for the company CP. This requires an effective SOP and personnel trained on CP administrative activities including— z Establishing the CP. z Displacing the CP. z Providing security. z Maintaining continuity of operations. z Executing sleep plans. z Managing stress. z Providing life support. z Maintaining equipment. (See Chapter 9 for more information on CP administrative activities.) TYPES OF COMMAND POSTS 7-20. Depending on the organization, type of unit, and situation, commanders echelon their headquarters into multiple CPs for the conduct of operations. A theater army is resourced with a main CP and a contingency CP. Corps, divisions, and brigade combat teams can employ a main CP, tactical CP, and a mobile command group. In addition, corps and divisions may operate a rear CP. Combined arms battalions, Stryker battalions, and infantry battalions can employ a main CP, tactical CP, combat trains CP, and a field trains CP. Some multifunctional brigades and battalions operate from a single main CP. Table 7-1 summarizes the various CPs resourced by echelon of command and type of unit. A detailed discussion of the functions of the types of CPs begins in paragraph 7-21. Beyond this publication and the table of organization and equipment (TO&E), units at all levels must establish SOPs to designate the commanders’ desired roles and responsibilities of each CP within their organization.

Maneuver battalions x Main command post. x Tactical command post. x Combat trains command post. x Field trains command post. (See ATP 3-90.5 for more information on combined arms and infantry battalion command posts.) MAIN COMMAND POST 7-21. A main command post is a portion of a unit headquarters containing the majority of the staff designed to command and control current operations, conduct detailed analysis, and plan future operations. The main CP is the unit’s principal CP serving as the primary location for plans, analysis, sustainment coordination, and assessment. It includes representatives of all staff sections, warfighting functions, and information systems to plan, prepare, execute, and assess operations. The main CP is larger in size and in staffing and less mobile than the tactical CP. The COS or XO provides staff supervision of the main CP. All units at battalion and higher echelons have a main CP. (See FM 3-94 for a detailed discussion on the specific differences in capabilities and roles of the main CP at different echelons.) 7-22. The main CP has general functions at most echelons. As the echelon grows through division and corps, the scope, function, and roles vary with capabilities. General functions of the main CP include— z Controlling operations. z Receiving reports for subordinate units and preparing reports required by higher echelon headquarters. z Planning operations, including branches and sequels. z Integrating intelligence into current operations and plans. z Synchronizing the targeting process. z Planning and synchronizing sustaining operations. z Assessing the overall progress of operations. 7-23. The main CP is significantly larger than the other CPs, and it is less mobile. Although it has some limited mobility, it requires additional support for full mobility. The main CP is capable of 24-hour operations indefinitely, and it needs to only pause operations to displace. The main CP is the only CP that can perform all the functions of the headquarters without the other CPs functioning. 7-24. Due to its size and electromagnetic signature, threat forces can find the main CP more easily than the other CPs. Commanders and staffs plan for placement of the main CP to mitigate vulnerability to threat targeting capabilities. (See paragraph 7-48 for beginning of discussion on CP survivability and paragraph 7- 56 on electromagnetic emissions and signatures.) CONTINGENCY COMMAND POST 7-25. A contingency command post is a portion of a unit headquarters tailored from the theater army headquarters that enables the commander to conduct small-scale operations within the assigned area of operations. Employing the contingency CP for a mission involves a tradeoff between the contingency Chapter 7 7-6 FM 6-0 0D\ CP’s immediate response capability and its known limitations. These limitations include the scale, scope, complexity, intensity, and duration of operations that it can effectively command without significant augmentation. The contingency CP depends on the main CP for long-range planning and special staff functional support. (See ATP 3-93 for doctrine on theater army organization and operations.) TACTICAL COMMAND POST 7-26. A tactical command post is a portion of a unit headquarters designed to command and control operations as directed. Commanders employ the tactical CP as an extension of the main CP to allow the main CP to displace or to control major events while the main CP focuses on other events, such as shaping operations. The tactical CP maintains continuous communications with subordinates, higher echelon headquarters, other CPs, and supporting units. The tactical CP is fully mobile and includes only essential Soldiers and equipment. The tactical CP relies on the main CP for planning, detailed analysis, and coordination. A deputy commander or operations officer (G-3 or S-3) generally leads the tactical CP. While corps through battalion commanders employ a tactical CP as an extension of the main CP, corps and division tactical CPs are resourced differently for functionality. The division tactical CP is resourced to afford the division commander the ability to separate into two functional elements to be used as the commander requires. The corps tactical CP is resourced as a stand-alone capability that nearly mirrors the main CP’s functionality. The functions of a tactical CP include but are not limited to— z Controlling decisive operations or specific shaping operations. z Controlling a specific task within larger operations such as a gap crossing, passage of lines, relief in place, or air assault operations. z Controlling the overall unit’s operations for a limited time when the main CP is displacing or otherwise not available. z Performing short-range planning. z Providing input to targeting and future operations planning. z Providing a forward location for issuing orders and conducting rehearsals. z Forming the headquarters of a task force with subordinate units task-organized under its control. (See FM 3-94 for more details on the corps and division tactical CP.) 7-27. When the commander does not employ the tactical CP, the staff assigned to it reinforces the main CP. Unit SOPs address the specifics for this reinforcement, including procedures to quickly detach the tactical CP from the main CP. 7-28. Some multifunctional brigades, functional brigades, and battalions are not resourced with a tactical CP by TO&E. Commanders can, however, form a tactical CP using the personnel and equipment authorized in the main CP to assist them with C2 based on the situation. REAR COMMAND POST 7-29. Depending on the situation—including the threat, size of the rear area, and number of units within the support and consolidation areas—division and corps commanders may form a rear CP to assist in controlling operations. The rear CP disperses the C2 signature and enables division and corps commanders to exercise C2 over disparate, functionally-focused elements operating between the close area and the division and corps rear boundary that may exceed the effective span of control of the main CP. 7-30. The rear CP is resourced based on mission requirements. The commander decides the composition and scope of responsibility for the rear CP using equipment and personnel from the main and tactical CPs. The corps rear CP normally co-locates with the maneuver enhancement brigade, which provides the rear CP with signal connectivity, sustainment, security, and workspace. Functions of the rear CP may include— z Planning and directing sustainment. z Terrain management. z Movement control. z Area security. 7-31. When augmented by the maneuver enhancement brigade staff, the rear CP may also— Command Posts 0D\ FM 6-0 7-7 z Plan and control combined arms operations with units under division or corps control. z Coordinate airspace. z Employ fires. 7-32. An assistant division commander for a division or the deputy corps commander for a corps can lead the rear CP. Corps or division commanders assign or designate specific functions and responsibilities assigned to the rear CP through an order. 7-33. A properly resourced rear CP assists corps and division commanders in shaping the rear area and coordinating with the support areas that complement the corps or division’s scheme of maneuver. This resourcing allows the main CP to focus on close and deep operations. COMBAT TRAINS COMMAND POST 7-34. Combined arms battalions and infantry battalions are also resourced a combat trains CP. The combat trains CP controls and coordinates administrative and logistics support. It consists of members from the S-1 staff section, S-4 staff sections, and aid station. The battalion S-4 leads this CP. The battalion’s forward support company normally co-locates with the combat trains CP. The combat trains CP— z Monitors current operations. z Prepares to assume the functions of the main CP. z Coordinates sustainment for the battalion. z Provides sustainment representation to the main CP for planning and integration. z Monitors main supply routes and controls sustainment traffic within the battalion’s area of operations. z Coordinates the evacuation of casualties, equipment, and detainees. z Manages battalion-level maintenance support. FIELD TRAINS COMMAND POST 7-35. The Army resources combined arms battalions and infantry battalions with a field trains CP. The battalion field trains and field trains CPs are located in the best positions to facilitate sustainment support. Field trains and field trains CPs are normally located within their battalion’s area of operations. Field trains usually include a personnel administration center, elements of the S-4 sustainment staff section, elements of company supply sections, and elements of the forward support company. The brigade headquarters and headquarters company commander leads the field trains CP.The battalion S-4 section coordinates all unit supply requests and ensures the battalion staff coordinated logistics needs of the battalion with the brigade support battalion and support operations officer. This coordination includes logistics packages moving forward into the battalion area of operations and maintenance requests. COMMAND GROUP AND MOBILE COMMAND GROUP 7-36. A command group and mobile command group allow the commander to maintain command and control when separated from the main, tactical, or rear command post. The mobile command group consists of assigned equipment to support the command group when necessary, and it is directed by the commander. A command group consists of the commander and selected staff members who assist the commander in controlling operations. Command group personnel include staff representation that can immediately affect current operations, such as maneuver, fires (including the air liaison officer), and intelligence. The mission dictates the command group’s makeup. For example, during a deliberate breach, the command group may include an engineer, fire support officer, and air defense officer. When visiting a dislocated civilian collection point, the commander may take a translator, civil affairs operations (known as CAO) officer, a medical officer, and a chaplain. 7-37. Personnel and equipment to form the command group come from the main CP or tactical CP for headquarters at brigade and lower echelons. Division and corps headquarters are equipped with mobile command group equipment on their TO&Es. The mobile command group serves as the commander’s mobile CP. It consists of ground and air component information systems. This equipment allows commanders to Chapter 7 7-8 FM 6-0 0D\ move to critical locations to personally assess a situation, make decisions, and influence operations. The mobile command group’s information systems and small staff allow commanders to move around while retaining communications with the entire force. A mobile command group allows a commander to— z Provide personal leadership, intent, and guidance at the critical place and time. z Make a personal assessment of the situation. z Maintain situational understanding while moving around the area of operations. z Travel with key staff officers necessary to provide information relevant to the current operation. EARLY-ENTRY COMMAND POST 7-38. An early-entry command post is a lead element of a headquarters designed to control operations until the remaining portions of the headquarters are deployed and operational. While not a separate section of the unit’s TO&E, the early-entry CP (sometimes referred to as an assault command post) is an ad hoc organization comprised of equipment and personnel from the staff of the tactical, main, and rear CPs. Commanders can establish an early-entry CP to assist them in controlling operations during the deployment phase of operations or to exercise C2 of early-entry forces during a joint forcible entry operation. The early- entry CP may consist of personnel and equipment from the tactical CP with additional intelligence analysts, planners, and other staff officers from the main CP based on the situation. 7-39. The early-entry CP performs the functions of the main and tactical CPs until those CPs are deployed and operational. A deputy commander, assistant division commander, COS or XO, or operations officer normally leads an early-entry CP. ORGANIZATION AND EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS 7-40. CPs provide locations from which commanders, assisted by their staffs, command operations and integrate and synchronize combat power to accomplish missions across the range of military operations. Commanders organize C2 systems into CPs based on mission requirements and the situation that will best help them exercise C2. Planning considerations for CP organization and employment can be categorized as— z Those contributing to effectiveness. z Those contributing to survivability. In many cases, these factors work against each other and therefore neither can be optimized. Tradeoffs are made to acceptably balance effectiveness and survivability. EFFECTIVENESS 7-41. CP personnel, equipment, and facilities are arranged to facilitate coordination, exchange information, and enable rapid decision making. A CP must effectively communicate with higher echelon, subordinate, adjacent, supporting, and supported units while maintaining the ability to move as required. Considerations for CP effectiveness include CP design, standardization, continuity, and capacity. Design 7-42. Well-designed CPs integrate command and staff efforts. Within a CP, the location of CP cells and staff elements are arranged to facilitate internal communication and coordination. This arrangement may change over the course of operations as the situation changes. Other layout considerations include— z The ease of information flow. z User interface with communications systems. z The positioning of information displays for ease of use. z The integrating of complementary information on maps and displays. z Adequate workspace for the staff and commander. z The ease of displacement (including setup, tear down, and movement). z The use of available terrain for security and electromagnetic masking. Command Posts 0D\ FM 6-0 7-9 Note. Unit SOPs should cover specific CP design, mobility and occupation procedures, priorities, and methods that emphasize speed, efficiency, and operability. Standardization 7-43. Standardization increases efficiency of CP operations. Commanders develop detailed SOPs for all aspects of CP operations, including CP layout, battle drills, meeting requirements, and reporting procedures. Staffs enforce and revise CP SOPs throughout training to make many CP activities routine. Trained staffs are prepared to effectively execute drills and procedures in demanding stressful times during operations. Continuity 7-44. CPs must be manned, equipped, and organized to control operations without interruptions. Commanders carefully consider the primary functions of CPs and CP cells to resource them accordingly in order to support continuous operations. Unit SOPs that address shift schedules, rest plans, and procedures for loss of communications with the commander, subordinates, or other CPs are critical to support continuous operations. 7-45. Continuity of command requires commanders to designate seconds in command and inform them of all critical decisions. Primary staff officers should also designate alternates in the event of losses. Further, a subordinate headquarters succession plan, to assume the role of the main CP in the event of a catastrophic loss, allows the command to quickly assume control from a configured and operating CP. A designated alternate CP is activated when— z The survivors of an attacked CP inform the command network of its attack, destruction, or inability to function. z A catastrophic loss of a C2 node occurs, and staffs cannot contact any element in the CP within a specified period. Unit SOPs are critical to continuity of C2 and operations. 7-46. Unit SOPs designate alternate CPs in for the tactical, main, and rear CPs as well as establish criteria for their activation. For example, the division artillery main CP or combat aviation brigade main CP could be designated the alternate division main CP in case of a catastrophic loss of the division main CP. Capacity 7-47. Commanders man and organize CPs to manage the information that CPs need to operate effectively. The capacity to plan, prepare, execute, and continuously assess operations concerns both staffing and the network, as does the ability to manage relevant information. CP personnel must be trained and have the requisite tactical and technical proficiency. SURVIVABILITY 7-48. CP survivability is vital to mission success. Depending on the threat, CPs need to remain as small as possible and highly mobile, especially at lower echelons. The enemy can easily acquire and target CPs when concentrated due to their electromagnetic signature and volume of communications. When possible, headquarters use available friendly detection assets to look at their CP across multiple spectrums, to include visual and electromagnetic. This will enable the CP to modify its configuration and use of terrain to best reduce visibility across those spectrums. This may include cover or shielding by terrain features or urban structures also known as terrain masking. Considerations for CP survivability include but are not limited to dispersion, size, redundancy, mobility, electromagnetic emissions and signatures. (See ATP 3-37.34 for more information on CP survivability and other considerations such as camouflage and concealment.) Dispersion 7-49. Dispersing CPs enhances the survivability of the commander’s C2 system. While the CP design structure of main, tactical, and rear CPs are inherently dispersed, units may decide to break up their physical footprint and electromagnetic signature even further. This may include the use of remote antennas to avoid Chapter 7 7-10 FM 6-0 0D\ concentrating the electromagnetic signature at the CP location. Commanders may also place minimum resources forward and keep more elaborate and vulnerable facilities back. This makes it harder for threats to find and attack CPs. It also decreases support and security requirements forward. Size 7-50. A CP’s size affects its mobility and survivability. Large CPs can increase capacity and efficiency with face-to-face coordination. Their size, however, makes them vulnerable to multiple acquisitions through visual, auditory, electromagnetic, and digital signatures causing an attack. Smaller CPs are easier to protect, but they may lack capacity to control operations effectively. The key to success is establishing the right balance of personnel and equipment to accomplish the mission. Staffs achieve this balance through exercise and training. For example, a commander resources the current operations cell for 24-hour operations. Other cells, such as plans, are not resourced for 24-hour operations. Redundancy 7-51. Reducing CP size may increase survivability by reducing visual signature and increasing mobility. However, some personnel and equipment redundancy is required for continuous operations. The appropriate amount of redundancy also allows CPs to continue to operate effectively in the event of personnel or equipment losses due to battlefield conditions. Mobility 7-52. Commanders may be required to displace CPs for survivability moves, threat indications, reactions, tempo, and preplanned and immediate movement of the main CP, the tactical CP, and the rear CP. CPs must deploy efficiently and maintain agility within their area of operations as the situation dictates. Staffs require detailed planning and terrain and enemy analysis during the intelligence preparation of the battlefield (known as IPB) to identify and coordinate alternate and subsequent CP locations throughout a unit’s area of operations. An alternate position is a defensive position that the commander assigns to a unit or weapon system for occupation when the primary position becomes untenable or unsuitable for carrying out the assigned task (ADP 3-90). A subsequent position is a position that a unit expects to move to during the course of battle (ADP 3-90). CP mobility is important, especially at lower echelons during large-scale combat operations. Lower echelon CPs and those employed forward in the combat zone may need to move quickly and often to survive in a peer or near-peer environment. Survivability moves and operational progress moves may increase survivability and maximize C2. Unit SOPs, transportation planning, and training facilitate rapid displacement and establishment of CPs throughout the battlefield. 7-53. Effectively displacing a CP is a complex operation that requires training and staff battle drills that each unit must practice extensively. Established SOPs will not only enhance CP mobility but also the conduct of battle handover and C2 of operations between CPs during movement. A unit must be able to displace CPs during tactical operations and simultaneously conduct its mission. 7-54. The recommended method is for each CP to split and displace by echelon. Typically, a quartering party will deploy forward to the new CP location and guide the main body in once conditions are set. Quartering party responsibilities include— z Conducting route reconnaissance. z Conducting area reconnaissance. z Determining area suitability. z Establishing initial security. z Establishing communications. z Organizing the area for follow-on main body. z Guiding the main body into and around the new location. 7-55. The main CP maintains situational awareness during the move, and the remaining CP (either the tactical CP or the rear CP for divisions and corps) maintains functional operations. Once the moving echelon establishes itself in its new location, CPs conduct an exchange, or battle handover, of only that critical information received during the move. The displacement of CPs should cause minimal disruption to normal Command Posts 0D\ FM 6-0 7-11 or ongoing activities. During displacement operations, a CP performs only those functions absolutely critical to support the battle or operation. In some situations, a CP may handover operations to a subordinate CP. Note. See paragraph 9-22 for a detailed discussion of CP site selection and paragraph 9-51 for CP displacement. Electromagnetic Emissions and Signatures 7-56. All electromagnetic equipment in a CP emits a signature. The threat’s ability to capture and identify the signature of a CP can be detrimental to its survival. Therefore, to improve the survivability of a CP, a unit controls emissions and limits the radiation of signatures that identify it as a CP. Units can do this through the application of electromagnetic protection and emission control (known as EMCON). Electromagnetic protections are techniques for limiting transmissions and using natural or manmade objects to mask radiated energy from traveling to undesirable destinations. An example of this is distributing the nodes of a CP across a portion of the area of operations rather than congregating nodes in a single location. 7-57. Emission control is the selective and controlled use of electromagnetic, acoustic, or other emitters to optimize command and control capabilities while minimizing, for operations security: a. detection by enemy sensors, b. mutual interference among friendly systems, and/or c. enemy interference with the ability to execute a military deception plan (JP 3-85). Examples of emission control are directives to emit in burst transmission or on lower power. Together emission control and electromagnetic protection are essential in the survivability of a CP; they prevent the threat from identifying and learning CP behavior and intentions through the detection of emissions and signatures. (See ATP 3-12.3 and JP 3-85 for further information on electromagnetic protection and emission control.) MULTINATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 7-58. Multinational operations is a collective term to describe military actions conducted by forces of two or more nations, usually undertaken within the structure of a coalition or alliance (JP 3-16). Other possible arrangements include supervision by an intergovernmental organization such as the United Nations. Commonly used terms under the multinational rubric title include allied, bilateral, coalition, multinational, combined coalition, or multilateral. Key considerations when organizing CPs and conducting CP operations in a multinational setting include— z Command structure. z Staffing. z Liaison and coordination. z Communications. z Multinational information sharing. COMMAND STRUCTURE 7-59. No single command structure fits the needs of all United Nations, alliance, or coalition command structures. Therefore, a multinational headquarters can form as a lead nation, a parallel command structure, or as a combination of the two. Lead Nation 7-60. Most multinational operations will use the lead nation command structure. This command structure recognizes that one nation is assigned the lead role. Normally, the lead nation is the country providing the largest number of forces for that operation. 7-61. In the lead nation command structure, the lead nation determines the C2 procedures while working closely with other national contingents. The lead nation should provide unique C2 equipment and software to the national component headquarters of other nations whenever feasible. Other nations participating in operations provide appropriate liaison to the lead nation headquarters. Robust liaison is essential to developing and maintaining unity of effort in multinational operations. Chapter 7 7-12 FM 6-0 0D\ Parallel Command Structure 7-62. An alternative to the lead nation command structure is the parallel command structure. Under a parallel command structure, no single coalition commander is named. To attain unity of effort, the coalition leaders develop a means to coordinate among the participants. If a single coalition commander and lack of unity of command do not exist, units avoid using a parallel command structure if possible. Combination 7-63. The lead nation command structure and a parallel command structure can exist simultaneously within a coalition. This occurs when two or more nations serve as controlling elements for a mix of international forces. While more desirable than the parallel command structure, an effort to achieve a total lead nation concept for unity of command is preferred. STAFFING 7-64. The multinational staff organization is based on which command structure is used to form the headquarters. The commander has a choice if the establishing authority designates an organization. If the establishing authority uses the lead nation command structure, the lead nation’s doctrine assigns the commander and staff’s duties.If the establishing authority uses a composite headquarters, the commander and staff specify duties in more detail. The multinational functions’ names may change based on sensitivities when working with organizations such as the United Nations. 7-65. Appropriate members in key positions from each country that provide forces are a part of the multinational staff. Each country represents and influences the force. These positions stem from the mission and type of operations conducted. Multinational commanders look at force composition as it applies to capabilities, limitations, and required support. The importance of knowing, trusting, and quickly reaching a comfort level with staff members makes it desirable for the multinational commander to choose members of the staff such as the COS or G-3. 7-66. When mission requirements exceed staff capabilities, the commander requests the necessary personnel, facilities, and equipment from either the national chain of command or the multinational establishing authorities. Personnel nominated to fill multinational augmentation billets possess— z Knowledge, confidence, and forcefulness. z Professionalism, character, and commitment. z The preparedness to represent their nations and units. z The understanding of the fact that they are the de facto country “experts.” z The ability to work as part of a multinational team without country parochialism. 7-67. Staff sections must be prepared to integrate allied, bilateral, coalition, multinational, combined coalition, or multilateral elements into their organizations. A staff orientation program helps ensure that all individuals joining the staff become familiar with their surroundings. (See FM 3-16 for further information regarding multinational force staffing and human resource challenges of multinational operations.) LIAISON AND COORDINATION 7-68. Liaison networks and coordination centers improve control of multinational forces. Regardless of the command structure, effective liaison is vital in any multinational force. Using a liaison is an invaluable tool between the multinational force and subordinate commands. It also— z Fosters a better understanding of mission and tactics. z Facilitates the transfer of vital information. z Enhances mutual trust. z Develops an increased level of teamwork. 7-69. A liaison supplies significant information for the multinational force headquarters about subordinate force readiness, training, and other factors. Early establishment reduces the fog and friction caused by incompatible communications systems, doctrine, and SOPs. Command Posts 0D\ FM 6-0 7-13 7-70. The command identifies and requests liaison personnel early. This request includes specific qualifications. Differences in doctrine, organization, equipment, and training among multinational forces demand a hardier liaison structure to facilitate operations than within a national force. Liaison teams cover many functions on a 24-hour basis. This requires more liaison personnel than a force normally has assigned. Liaison personnel must have equipment compatible with a multinational force. 7-71. Liaison personnel understand the capabilities and limitations of parent units and nations, including the structure, capabilities, weapon systems, logistics, and planning methods employed and their national interests. Whether personnel are qualified in language or have interpreter support, they understand the language and culture of the multinational headquarters to which they are attached. This ensures successful liaison operations. However, professional knowledge and functional expertise are far more important. Officers who have participated in schools and training with other multinationals or have experience in multinational operations provide this expertise depending on their experience. Careful selection of fully qualified liaison officers who are Army professionals in competence, character, and commitment is important to mission success. The sending command provides liaison teams with knowledge of the language, organization, materiel, and doctrine of multinational partners and an understanding of appropriate regional information. The liaison officers assigned to the multinational force headquarters influence decision making. These officers also possess the authority to answer routine multinational force queries on behalf of their commands. 7-72. Once liaison is established, liaison teams directly represent their commanders. They advise, help, coordinate, and monitor their commands. Liaison teams attend briefings and maintain close contact with the multinational operations center. However, the command they become a part of does not formally task their sending unit through the liaison officer. Formal tasking occurs through the normal C2 channels. 7-73. The commander determines whether to integrate multinational liaison personnel into the staff of the multinational force or not. When integration creates a more effective organization, the multinational force establishes an orientation program for all liaison personnel. The multinational personnel reception center performs this requirement. The multinational force determines which staff officer or staff section is responsible for liaison personnel reporting to the headquarters. (For more information on liaison, see Chapter 3.) COMMUNICATION 7-74. Communication is fundamental to successful multinational operations. It is important to prepare for communication during planning. Mission analysis and assessment provide the opportunity for the communications officer to identify communications requirements and evaluate in-country capability. 7-75. Language barriers may cause difficulties in interoperability with other armies and in dealing with the host nation. Language problems can make it difficult to sustain a rapid decision cycle. Translators and interpreters are critical to mission success. Communication with the local population and multinational forces can be greatly hindered without them. At times, common tasks such as sharing intelligence, must await translation before data can pass through the command and thus slow the development of plans and execution. Language capability speeds command, reduces confusion, and contributes to mutual respect. Forces must be able to exchange information effectively to work successfully together. Few linguists have both the technical expertise and depth of understanding to be understood fully while crossing both language and doctrinal boundaries. Initial Considerations 7-76. Many communication problems are solved through equipment exchange and liaison teams. Continual liaison between communications planners helps alleviate interoperability issues. Communications requirements vary with the mission, composition, and geography of the area of operations. Interoperability is constrained by the least technologically advanced nation. The multinational force addresses the need for integrated communications among all forces early in the operation’s planning phase. 7-77. In a multinational force, a primary communications link is between the lead nation and the national contingent headquarters. The ability for commanders, staffs, and subordinates to communicate with civilian agencies across all operations is important. The lead nation and contingent headquarters consider the Chapter 7 7-14 FM 6-0 0D\ transition to subsequent units, commercial communications, or the transition to agencies such as the United Nations early in operations. 7-78. The multinational force plans for adequate communications to include using voice (secure and nonsecure), data, and video teleconferencing. The force needs a deployable communications capability and enough trained operators for sustained operations with multiple means of communications to avoid the possibility of a single point of failure. (For more information on multinational communications requirements, see FM 3-16.) Adequate Equipment 7-79. In addition to problems of compatibility and security, many units do not have enough communications equipment to meet mission requirements. During initial planning stages, planners identify required communications, issues of spectrum management, and controls on access to information. Liaison teams, with adequate communications gear, reduce the severity of some of these problems. Satellite communications relay communications between higher echelon headquarters whether that be Army, joint, or multinational. Other space capabilities, such as weather reporting and use of Global Positioning Systems, are also needed. 7-80. Communications planners anticipate these requirements during initial planning, evaluate host-nation communications resources, and integrate the requirements into the communications plan. These means must satisfy operational requirements. Common-user communications are used for operations if sufficient capacity exists to ensure acceptable reaction times. Although many combined communications doctrine techniques and procedures exist, there are some differences in operating standards. 7-81. In the past, coalition forces achieved communications using a limited number of simple voice and data links. Now, technologically limited or disparate coalition partners connect through equipment loans and liaison teams. Such connections will continue to occur for the immediate future. Still, user demands, sophisticated applications, and the goal of network-enabled operations push communications planners to integrate coalition partners into a seamless and richly connected information-sharing environment. Any hope to achieve this vision requires communications planners to liaise with their coalition counterparts as early as possible in the planning phase of operations. Early liaison helps planners identify and solve the inevitable interoperability and security problems. MULTINATIONAL INFORMATION SHARING 7-82. Every multinational operation is different and so are the ways that the force collects and disseminates information and intelligence. Classification presents a problem in releasing information but keeping as much unclassified or releasable information as possible improves interoperability, trust, and operational effectiveness in the multinational force. Using techniques such as the joint’s “write for release” and the use of tear lines contribute to releasability as well. 7-83. Intelligence sharing is the most contentious issue in multinational operations, and it is one that commanders fully address to ensure everyone understands national policy limitations. Commanders know other nation’s positions on intelligence sharing and ensure that intelligence is shared to the greatest degree possible, especially if required for mission accomplishment and force protection. Early information sharing during planning ensures that multinational force requirements are clearly stated, guidance supports the commander’s intent, and the multinational force uses procedures supportable by other nations. 7-84. Multinational information sharing occurs in accordance with foreign disclosure regulations. The G-2 or S-2 foreign disclosure officer articulates the release instructions to operators, collectors, analysts, and planners who write for releasability to the members of a particular coalition. The G-2 or S-2 consults the foreign disclosure officer who is involved early in the planning of operations to facilitate lines of communications between Army elements and partner nations. 7-85. The foreign disclosure office may approve the disclosure of classified military information and controlled unclassified information to foreign representatives. This is based on the policies, directives, and laws that govern National Disclosure Policy (known as NDP-1) and the release of classified information. The foreign disclosure office provides this service to the commanders and staffs. Each nation individually determines what collected information can be passed, in what format, and how that information is passed. Command Posts 0D\ FM 6-0 7-15 The commander enforces National Disclosure Policy and disclosure of classified information to multinational intelligence partners through the foreign disclosure office. The primary foreign disclosure officer has responsibility for this action and is frequently selected from within the G-2 staff. There are often subordinate foreign disclosure officers throughout the staff and subordinate formations and foreign disclosure representatives to assist the foreign disclosure officer. The foreign disclosure officer is responsible for the oversight and coordination of specific disclosure of or access to classified military information and controlled unclassified information to representatives of foreign governments and international organizations. (See Appendix D and AR 380-10 for more details on foreign disclosure.) Note. Currently, the U.S. Army lacks the ability to rapidly and routinely operate in a mission partner environment (known as MPE) without high costs and ad hoc equipment, which leaves units unable to train as they fight. Therefore, the Army is currently transitioning its primary warfighting network enclave from a SECRET U.S.-only network to a network enclave operating at a Secret/Releasable (known as S//REL) classification to enable secure worldwide accessibility to unified action partners in support of operations across all domains. CONCLUSION 7-86. CPs are arranged by echelon and unit, and they differ based on organization and employment. Commanders systematically arrange platforms, operation centers, signal nodes, and support equipment in ways best suited for a particular operational environment. Depending on the organization, type of unit, and situation, commanders echelon their headquarters into multiple CPs for the conduct of operations. CPs come in many different structures, and they may consist of vehicles, containers, and tents, or located in buildings. CPs provide the physical location for people, processes, and networks to directly assist commanders in understanding, visualizing, describing, directing, leading, and assessing operations. This page intentionally left blank. 0D\ FM 6-0 8-1 Chapter 8 Command Post Organization This chapter begins by describing the components of a command and control (C2) system. It then discusses the building blocks that commanders use to organize their command posts (CPs). Next, the chapter provides considerations for organizing personnel. The chapter concludes with techniques for the physical layout of a CP to facilitate effective CP operations. COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM 8-1. Commanders organize the components of their C2 system into CPs. They do this to— z Support decision making. z Collect, create, and maintain relevant information and create products to support understanding and visualization. z Prepare and communicate directives. PEOPLE 8-2. A commander’s C2 system begins with people. Commanders base their C2 system on human characteristics and abilities more than on equipment and procedures. Key personnel dedicated to C2 include seconds in command, command sergeants major, and the staffs. Commanders organize staffs cross functionally into CPs, CP cells, and staff sections to assist them with the exercise of C2 as described in paragraphs 8-6 through 8-35. PROCESSES 8-3. Processes and procedures help commanders organize the activities in CPs and throughout the force. Processes and procedures govern actions within a C2 system to make it more effective and efficient. A process is a series of actions or steps to achieve an outcome. For example, the military decision-making process consists of a series of steps used to produce a plan or order. Procedures are standard detailed steps that describe how to perform specific tasks. Commands and staff use doctrinal processes and develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all aspects of CP operations. (See Chapter 9 for a discussion of CP operations.) NETWORKS 8-4. A network is a grouping of people or things interconnected for a purpose. Networks, such as the Department of Defense information network, allow computer data sharing and global communications. The network enables commanders to communicate information and control forces. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion of networks and command post communications.) COMMAND POSTS 8-5. Often divided into echelons, each echelon of the headquarters is a CP regardless of whether the commander is present or not. The standardized integrated CP (consisting of tents, vehicle platforms, and equipment) is typically a moveable and sometimes a mobile facility that can set up, operate, and tear down quickly. Chapter 8 8-2 FM 6-0 0D\ ORGANIZING PEOPLE 8-6. The Department of the Army develops headquarters for specific purposes, and it documents personnel and equipment requirements to operate that headquarters in a table of organization and equipment (TO&E). The TO&E is a standard authorization document that prescribes organizational structure, personnel, and equipment requirements of a military unit. Headquarters’ TO&Es authorize individual staff members by rank and specialty to specific staff elements within staff sections or CP cells. A TO&E does not account for administrative or garrison responsibilities as it resources wartime essential requirements for the unit. Army doctrine expands on this organization and describes the tactics and techniques for employing and operating each type of headquarters. 8-7. Commanders further establish personnel and equipment requirements by developing a modified TO&E (known as MTOE) from the TO&E. In doing so, commanders prescribe, in more detail, the personnel and equipment required to accomplish missions in specific operational environments or specific points on a modernization path. Commanders can change their individual modified TO&E with Department of the Army approval. 8-8. A headquarters may also have a Table of Distribution and Allowance. The Table of Distribution and Allowance is commonly used to document installation commands and includes Department of the Army Civilian positions. Types of Tables of Distribution and Allowance include mobilization, augmentation, and full-time support. 8-9. The unit modified TO&E and supporting doctrine provides the foundation that commanders and staffs refer to when organizing their CPs for specific operations. Based on the situation or preference, commanders adjust their CP organization to meet mission requirements. When organizing personnel into CPs for operations or training exercises, commanders, chiefs of staff (COSs) or executive officers (XOs), and the staffs consider— z Staff sections and elements. z CP cells. z Boards, working groups, and planning teams. z Augmentation. STAFF SECTIONS AND ELEMENTS 8-10. The basic staff structure includes a COS or XO and various staff sections.The duties and responsibilities inherent in an area of expertise are called functional responsibilities. Chapter 2 provides a detailed description of the functional responsibilities for coordinating, special, and personal staff officers. 8-11. Staff sections consist of elements and subgroupings of an area of expertise. For example, a G-4 logistics staff section is composed of maintenance, supply, services, transportation, automation, and current operations support elements. Each of these staff elements has specific functional responsibilities within the logistics area of expertise. TO&Es authorize personnel and equipment to the staff element level within a headquarters. COMMAND POST CELLS 8-12. Coordinating, special, and personal staff sections, as described in Chapter 2, are the building blocks for organizing the headquarters into CPs. In CPs, staffs sections are cross-functionally organized into CP cells. A command post cell is a grouping of personnel and equipment organized by warfighting function or by planning horizon to facilitate the exercise of command and control. Functional cells group personnel and equipment by warfighting function. Integrating cells group personnel and equipment by planning horizon. The integrating cells are the primary cells that assist the commander in planning, preparing, executing, and assessing operations as a whole. They are responsible for integrating the warfighting functions and synchronizing units and activities for the commander. Figure 8-1 depicts functional and integrating cells. Command Post Organization 0D\ FM 6-0 8-3 Figure 8-1. Functional and integrating cells 8-13. Figure 8-1 depicts the basic organizational structure of a CP. Staff sections and elements of staff sections (represented by gray boxes) form functional cells. The functional cells are represented by the vertical ovals. The makeups of the functional cells are contained in paragraphs 8-17 through 8-21. 8-14. The integrating cells coordinate and synchronize the warfighting functions in accordance with the commander’s intent for a specified planning horizon. Integrating cells are depicted by the horizontal rectangles in figure 8-1 which cut across the functional cells and staff sections. The integrating cells are current operations, future operations, and plans. 8-15. Not all staff sections permanently reside in one of the functional or integrating cells. The G-6 or S-6, and G-9 or S-9 sections are examples. These staff sections provide representation to different CP cells as required, and they coordinate their activities in the various working groups, boards, and planning teams. Functional Cells 8-16. The functional cells within a CP are intelligence, movement and maneuver, fires, protection, and sustainment. There is not a specific C2 cell because the entire CP assists the commander with exercising C2. Echelons above brigade are resourced with all five functional cells, but not all brigade and battalion headquarters resource all five functional cells. Intelligence Cell 8-17. The intelligence cell coordinates activities and systems that facilitate understanding of the enemy, terrain, weather, and other relevant aspects of an operational environment. The intelligence cell requests, receives, and analyzes information from multiple sources to produce and distribute intelligence products. The intelligence cell consists of most of the intelligence staff and an attached U.S. Air Force weather team. The unit’s G-2 or S-2 officer leads this cell. Chapter 8 8-4 FM 6-0 0D\ Movement and Maneuver Cell 8-18. The movement and maneuver cell coordinates the related tasks and systems that move and employ forces to achieve a position of relative advantage over the enemy and other threats. This includes tasks related to gaining a positional advantage by combining forces with force projection (movement) and direct fire (maneuver). Elements of operations, airspace control, aviation, engineer, geospatial information and service, and space support elements all form this cell. Staff elements in the movement and maneuver cell also form the core of the current operations integration cell. The unit’s G-3 or S-3 officer leads this cell. (See paragraphs 8-27 and 8-28 for a discussion of the current operations integration cell.) Fires Cell 8-19. The fires cell coordinates, plans, integrates, and synchronizes the employment and assessment of Army, joint, and multinational fires in support of operations. The fires cell recommends targeting guidance to the commander, including the selection of high-payoff targets. The fires cell plans, synchronizes, coordinates, and integrates fires matched to a wide range of targets and targeting systems. The fires cell coordinates target acquisition, target dissemination, and target engagement functions for the commander. The unit’s senior artillery officer on the staff—typically the chief of fires (at the theater army), deputy fire support coordinator (at corps and division echelons), or fire support officer (at brigade and lower echelons)—leads this cell or element (depending on the echelon). The senior artillery officer receives direction from the fire support coordinator—who is usually the commander of the senior artillery unit assigned or attached to the headquarters for the operation—when there is one. Note. Field artillery battalions through corps have fire support elements (known as FSEs), and echelons above corps have fires cells. Protection Cell 8-20. The protection cell is responsible for integrating, coordinating, and synchronizing protection tasks and activities. The protection cell advises commanders on the priorities for protection and coordinates the implementation and sustainment of protective measures to protect assets according to the commander’s priorities. The elements that compose the protection cell are safety; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear; engineer; surgeon; explosive ordnance disposal; personnel recovery; and the provost marshal. The COS or XO designates the appropriate officer to lead this cell. At the division level and above, the provost marshal is typically the chief of protection. Sustainment Cell 8-21. The sustainment cell coordinates activities and systems that provide support and services to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance. It includes those tasks associated with logistics, financial management, personnel services, and health service support. The following staff sections form this cell: personnel, logistics, financial management, and surgeon. The G-4 or S-4 leads this cell at brigade and lower echelons. Integrating Cells 8-22. While functional cells are organized by warfighting functions, integrating cells are organized by planning horizons. A planning horizon is a point in time commanders use to focus the organization’s planning efforts to shape future events (ADP 5-0). The three planning horizons are long-, mid-, and short-range and are associated with the plans cell, future operations cell, and current operations integration cell, respectively. 8-23. Not all echelons and types of units are resourced for all three integrating cells. Battalions, for example, combine planning and operations into one integrating cell in the main CP. The brigade combat team has a small and dedicated plans cell, but it is not resourced for a future operations cell. Divisions and corps are resourced for all three integrating cells, as shown in figure 8-2. Command Post Organization 0D\ FM 6-0 8-5 Figure 8-2. Integrating cells Plans Cell 8-24. The plans cell is responsible for planning operations within the long-range planning horizons. It develops the initial operation order (known as OPORD) and prepares for operations beyond the scope of the current order, including developing branch plans and sequels. The plans cell also oversees military deception planning. At division and above, the plans cell consists of a core group of planners led by the G-5. Staff sections support the plans cell as required. Brigades and below are not resourced a dedicated plans cell; however, commanders may assign a specified plans officer from the current operations cell. Future Operations Cell 8-25. The future operations cell is responsible for planning operations in the mid-range planning horizon. This cell focuses on adjustments to current operations, including the positioning or maneuvering of forces in depth that facilitate continuation of current operations. The future operations cell consists of a core group of planners led by the future operations officer. All staff sections assist as required. Divisions and higher echelon headquarters are resourced a future operations cell, while brigades and battalions are not. 8-26. The future operations cell serves as a bridge between the plans and current operations integration cells. The future operations cell monitors current operations and determines implications for operations within the mid-range planning horizon. In coordination with the current operations integration cell, the future operations cell assesses whether staff must modify ongoing operations to achieve the current phase’s objectives. The commander directs adjustments to operations, or the cell recommends options to the commander. Once the commander decides to adjust operations, the cell develops the fragmentary orders necessary to implement the change. The future operations cell also participates in the targeting working group since the same planning horizons normally concern them both, including shaping operations in the deep area. The future operations Chapter 8 8-6 FM 6-0 0D\ cell updates and adds details to the branch plans foreseen in current operations and prepares any orders necessary to implement a sequel to operations. Current Operations Integration Cell 8-27. The current operations integration cell (COIC) is the focal point for controlling the execution of operations. This involves assessing the current situation while regulating forces and warfighting functions in accordance with the mission, commander’s intent, and concept of operations. The chief of operations or assistant S-3 leads this cell. Elements or watch officers from each staff section and liaison officers from subordinate and adjacent units form this cell. All staff sections are represented either permanently or on call in the COIC. 8-28. The COIC manages the common operational picture (COP) to display relevant information within a commander’s area of interest. It is tailored to the user’s requirements and based on common data and information shared by units in the area of operations. The COIC synchronizes operations while conducting shift changes, assessments, and other briefings as required to aid in the overall situational understanding of the command. The COIC provides information on the status of operations to all staff members and to higher, subordinate, and adjacent units. The COIC conducts short-range planning and the operations synchronization meeting. (See FM 5-0 for a discussion of synchronization and decision-making tools.) BOARDS, WORKING GROUPS, AND PLANNING TEAMS 8-29. Most staff work occurs within the functional and integrating cells. Staff members must also integrate their efforts with other CP cells and staff sections and with organizations external to the headquarters. Effective staff integration occurs when functional expertise from across the staff comes together in support of the commander’s decision requirements. As such, commanders establish temporary groupings of staff members in boards, working groups, and planning teams as shown in figure 8-3. Figure 8-3. Cross-functional staff integration Command Post Organization 0D\ FM 6-0 8-7 8-30. Commanders establish boards, working groups, and planning teams to coordinate actions and solve problems. The primary difference between boards and working groups is the level of authority granted to boards by commanders. Commanders chair boards or grant decision-making authority to boards within a specific functional area. Working groups coordinate action and develop recommendations for approval by the commander or a board. Planning teams assist commanders in solving problems and developing directives for implementation. The number, type, composition, and frequency of boards, working groups, and planning teams is situation-dependent based on the type of unit, echelon, and type of operations. Boards 8-31. Commanders establish boards and assign responsibilities and decision-making authority for each board. Commanders or senior leaders chair boards with members of the board consisting of staff elements, subordinate commands, and representatives of other organizations as required. There are two types of boards: command and functional. The commander chairs a command board. The command board’s purpose is to gain guidance or a decision from a commander. A senior leader with delegated authority from the commander chairs functional boards. Depending on the situation, commanders may appoint boards for various functions. Typical boards found within the unit’s battle rhythm include the— z Operations assessment board. z Plans synchronization board. z Sustainment board. z Targeting board. (See Chapter 4 for sample membership and meeting agendas for these boards.) Working Groups 8-32. Working groups address various subjects depending on the situation and echelon. Their cross- functional design enables working groups to synchronize contributions from multiple CP cells and staff sections. For example, the targeting working group brings together representatives of all staff sections concerned with targeting. Battalion and brigade headquarters have fewer working groups than higher echelons do. Working groups may convene daily, weekly, monthly, or intermittently depending on the subject, situation, and echelon. Typical working groups at division and corps headquarters scheduled in the unit’s battle rhythm include the— z Assessment working group. z Civil affairs operations (known as CAO) working group. z Cyberspace electromagnetic activities working group. z Information collection working group. z Information operations working group. z Knowledge management working group. z Protection working group. z Sustainment working group. z Targeting working group. (See Chapter 4 for sample membership and meeting agendas for these working groups.) Planning Teams 8-33. The plans and future operations cells perform most of the planning in the headquarters. For major planning requirements, such as the development of a new operation order, representatives from across the staff form the planning team and conduct the military decision-making process. (See FM 5-0 for a detailed discussion of the military decision-making process.) 8-34. In addition to major planning efforts, commanders, staff sections, and working group leaders establish planning teams to solve problems and develop solutions related to a specific task or requirement. A planning team consists of a lead planner (normally from the G-3 or S-3 or G-5), functional planners (from intelligence, fires, protection, sustainment cells), and other subject matter experts as required. Planning teams are not enduring. They dissolve on completion of their assigned tasks. Chapter 8 8-8 FM 6-0 0D\ 8-35. Commanders may form a planning team (sometimes referred to as a design team) to perform Army design methodology. This team leverages multiple and diverse perspectives and knowledge to help the commander understand operational environments and problems and to develop an operational approach to solve those problems. (See ATP 5-0.1 for a discussion of forming and leading planning teams.) COMMAND POST LAYOUT 8-36. The physical layout of a CP has a significant impact on its functionality. A layout contributes to how efficiently information passes from one staff element to another and how easily sections communicate with one another. User interface with communications systems and positioning of information displays are important considerations. Providing adequate group work space and briefing areas is also an important consideration. 8-37. Commanders validate the layout or design of their CPs during exercises and training events. CP layouts (including positioning of personnel, information systems and displays, equipment, network cabling, and electricity requirements) are tested, adjusted as required, and captured in the unit’s SOP. Commanders and staffs adjust their vetted CP designs in the unit’s SOP based on the situation during operations. These considerations aid in designing the physical layout of a CP: z Staff integration and crosstalk. z Trafficability. z COP visibility. z Lighting and climate control. z Ease of displacement. STAFF INTEGRATION AND CROSSTALK 8-38. The spatial arrangement of staff elements in a CP can greatly promote or inhibit staff integration. Effective layouts minimize compartmentalization of staff elements. CP cells and staff sections are positioned based on commonality and coordination requirements. For example, having fires, intelligence, and current operations cells near each other is critical during operations since they need to coordinate actions. 8-39. Effective C2 requires a current operations area (including positioning watch officers) designed to facilitate the rapid exchange of information and the execution of battle drills. Many units set up a current operations cell and use it as a hub with plans, sustainment, briefing, and leadership areas (often in tents) as spokes. Though this setup does centralize operations, it also forces all personnel traffic to flow through the current operations cell to get to any of the other sections. The current operations cell can become a meeting area or place to loiter, which causes an increase in noise and distraction for the personnel trying to track and control current operations. A more efficient and effective layout involves placing the current operations cell away from common areas.This setup reduces traffic flow through the current operations cell, lessens noise, and facilitates a proper environment to exercise command and control. TRAFFICABILITY 8-40. Trafficability is the free flow of personnel and information in the CP. Trafficability also provides staffs with the space necessary to perform their duties. This critical characteristic accounts for the accessibility of certain areas of the CP. Apportionment of floor space plays a key role in establishing suitable trafficability and sets conditions for efficient knowledge management and information distribution. Commanders segregate planning areas from CP briefing and operations areas to enable planners to think, concentrate, and develop planning products. COMMON OPERATIONAL PICTURE VISIBILITY 8-41. COP visibility is the degree to which the aggregate of all COP displays within a CP are conspicuous, recognizable, and accessible to those attempting to gain and maintain situational awareness. Adequate COP visibility sets the condition for effective battle tracking and decision making. CP personnel prioritize and emplace COP displays—both digital and analog—based on relevancy to facilitating situational awareness for all CP members. (For more information on the COP, see ADP 6-0). Command Post Organization 0D\ FM 6-0 8-9 LIGHTING AND CLIMATE CONTROL 8-42. Ensuring that the CP has adequate lighting and a controlled climate is as fundamental as ensuring that a CP has automation. These particular characteristics highlight a unit’s internal power generation capability and the criticality of well-thought out load plans. Sensitivity to these characteristics drives requirements for such things as a loss of power, routine generator maintenance, climate control device maintenance and servicing, and the need for an analog set of COP displays. EASE OF DISPLACEMENT 8-43. Most CPs are employed in the close area and, because of their mission and proximity to the enemy, are vulnerable to acquisition and attack. Therefore, CPs must move quickly and often to avoid attack. Both size and standardization facilitate repeated emplacement and displacement of CPs. Standardization 8-44. Standardization increases efficiency of CP operations and the ability to displace quickly. Commanders and staffs develop detailed SOPs for all aspects of CP operations to include CP layout, battle drills, meeting requirements, and reporting procedures. Leaders enforce and revise CP SOPs throughout training. Doing this makes many CP activities routine. Trained staffs are prepared to effectively execute drills and procedures in demanding times during operations and the displacement of the CP. Size 8-45. A CP’s size affects its ability to displace. Larger CPs tend to have larger staffs that allow for more face-to-face coordination. However, their size makes them difficult to protect and displace. Smaller CPs are easier to protect and displace but may lack capability to effectively provide continuity and control operations. Commanders must balance vulnerability with capabilities when determining the size of the CP. 8-46. Smaller physical structures also reduce the visual signature of a CP, making them easier to hide and less likely to be visually acquired by enemy reconnaissance forces. Larger CPs, with larger equipment footprints, often take longer to pack and displace. This movement and activity also increases risk of visual or sensor acquisition by enemy forces. CONCLUSION 8-47. CP structure is vital to the successful accomplishment of any mission. It is where all the other elements of a C2 system come together to help the commander conduct operations. While the equipment and personnel in CPs are listed in manning and equipment documents, commanders must clearly understand organizational requirements. Effective commanders tailor their CPs to best fit their particular situation. This page intentionally left blank. 0D\ FM 6-0 9-1 Chapter 9 Command Post Operations This chapter begins by describing continuous operations. Next, it provides consideration for developing command post (CP) standard operating procedures (SOPs) to facilitate continuous operations. A discussion of CP security and defense follows. This chapter concludes with a discussion about life support for CP personnel and equipment. CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS 9-1. Army operations are continuous, and units operate at the same level of intensity for extended periods. Units and organizations must man, equip, and organize CPs to execute operations and sustain command and control (C2) without interruption. 9-2. During continuous operations, CP personnel perform several routine and recurring tasks to establish, operate, and move CPs. With the assistance of their staffs, commanders develop processes and procedures for performing these tasks. The collective whole of those processes and procedures are encapsulated in SOPs to govern CP operations. COMMAND POST STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES 9-3. Commanders establish and use SOPs to organize the activities in the CPs. SOPs combine detailed steps with checklists that describe how to perform specific tasks to achieve a desired end state. Adhering to an SOP minimizes confusion, misunderstanding, and hesitation as commanders make frequent and rapid decisions to meet the continuous nature of operational requirements. 9-4. Commanders ensure that comprehensive and detailed SOPs are developed, maintained, trained upon, and used for all aspects of CP operations. In this way, CP operations become routine and are successfully executed in periods of stress and rapid tempo. CP operations and their associated SOPs should be known and rehearsed by all CP personnel. At a minimum, CP SOPs include— z CP rules of conduct. z Duties and responsibilities of key personnel. z Establishment of the CP (site selection and setup). z Battle rhythm. z Staffing and shifts plans, including eating, fitness, and sleeping plans. z CP battle drills. z Building and maintaining of situational understanding. z Displacement of the CP. z Physical security and defense of the CP. z CP life support. z Traffic flow and control and vehicle parking. Unit SOPs provide the basic framework for CP operations. They allow common repeated tasks to be standardized and executed quickly, enabling CPs to operate more effectively and efficiently. (See ATP 3- 90.90 for detailed information on developing SOPs.) Chapter 9 9-2 FM 6-0 0D\ COMMAND POST RULES OF CONDUCT 9-5. CP operations call for strict focus and discipline from all personnel. For this reason CPs establish SOPs that outline rules for maintaining good order and discipline. Posting these rules in a highly visible area in the CP is a technique that helps remind personnel of those rules. At a minimum, these rules should address— z CP cleanliness standards. z Noise, light, and litter discipline. z Proper weapon-handling procedures. z Proper uniform standards. z Conduct before, during, and after meetings. z Sensitive item control procedures. z Classified information handling procedures. z Daily maintenance requirements. z CP access controls such as badging, challenge, and password. z Personal electronic devices. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF KEY PERSONNEL 9-6. The CP is where commanders establish their C2 systems, and staffs are key components of those systems. A CP must be staffed by personnel with the appropriate skills and military occupational specialties to exercise C2. The assigned roles of officers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs) in the CP structure are critical to effective operations and mission accomplishment. Individuals must not only have their ability to perform their duties, but they also understand how their duties relate to others’ duties throughout the CP. 9-7. A detailed list of duties and responsibilities of CP personnel in the SOP helps enable efficient CP operations and C2. Paragraphs 9-8 through 9-20 address the responsibilities of key personnel who contribute to the overall synchronization of operations located in the current operations integration cell (COIC) of a CP. Chief of Staff or Executive Officer 9-8. The chief of staff (COS) or executive officer (XO) is the commander’s principal assistant. Commanders normally delegate executive management authority to the COS or XO. As the key staff integrator, the COS or XO frees the commander from routine details of staff operations and the management of the CP. Division and higher echelon units are assigned a COS. Brigades and battalions are assigned an XO. The COS or XO ensures efficient and effective CP operations. The COS or XO duties include, but are not limited to— z Coordinating and directing the work of the staff. z Establishing and monitoring the CP battle rhythm and nesting it with higher echelon and subordinate headquarters’ battle rhythms for effective planning support, decision making, and other critical functions. z Representing the commander when authorized. z Formulating and disseminating staff policies. z Ensuring effective liaison exchanges with higher echelon, subordinate, and adjacent units and other organizations as required. z Supervising the sustainment of the CP and activities of the headquarters and headquarters battalion or company. z Supervising staff training for CP operations. z Supervising the special staff sections in division through Army Service component command headquarters. z Approving site selection of the CP. Command Post Operations 0D\ FM 6-0 9-3 Operations Sergeant Major 9-9. The operations sergeant major is a senior NCO in the CP responsible for monitoring and supervising the performance of the enlisted operations staff. The operations sergeant major assists the operations officer in all matters pertaining to the operations process, including planning, rehearsing, monitoring, and controlling operations in the COIC. In addition, the operations sergeant major assists the CP officer in charge with CP administration including, but not limited to— z Establishing the CP. z Displacing the CP. z Providing security for the CP. z Maintaining continuity of CP operations. z Executing sleep plans. z Managing stress within the CP. 9-10. The operations sergeant major directs section NCOs to maintain guard rosters, sleep plans, shift schedules, and discipline in and around the CP. The operations sergeant major works closely with the headquarters company NCO in charge on the logistics requirements, tactical employment, and security of the CP. Specific duties of the operations sergeant major include— z Leading, guiding, training, developing, and mentoring Soldiers during CP operations. z Assisting in the setup and conduct of rehearsals and briefings, including operation orders briefings. z Enforcing battle rhythm, standards, and discipline in and around the CP. z Assisting in development, refinement, and enforcement of the unit’s SOPs. z Recommending priorities regarding allocation of resources. z Preparing operational records and reports and ensuring the implementation of administrative policies and procedures. z Directing the planning, implementing, and supervising of the CP security and defense plan. z Coordinating with higher echelon headquarters for life support. z Assisting with planning, implementing, and supervising CP displacement. z Overseeing the setup, operation, and dismantling of the CP. z Assisting with casualty and equipment evacuation operations. z Directing the shift NCO in charge on traffic control, shift changes, orders production, communications networks, network discipline, and reporting and log accuracy. Battle Captain 9-11. Units use the term battle captain to identify the shift officer in charge in a CP. Units associate the term with position, not rank. The battle captain assists the commander by being the focal point in the CP for communications, coordination, and information management. The battle captain is responsible for knowing the current situation two echelons lower than the CP and the activities of adjacent units at all times. 9-12. To function effectively, the battle captain has a working knowledge of all elements in the CP, understands unit SOPs, and ensures that the CP staff uses them. The battle captain knows the current plan and task organization of the unit and understands the commander’s intent. In addition, the battle captain understands the limits of the battle captain’s own decision making and action authority. 9-13. The battle captain ensures that relevant information is given to decision makers. The battle captain works closely with all members of the command group and the staff. The battle captain ensures that those staffs continuously update unit status. The battle captain analyzes new information as it enters the CP and passes it to the appropriate staff officers or the commander. The battle captain knows the commander’s critical information requirements and understands the criteria and triggers for the commander’s decision points. The battle captain knows the scheme of maneuver and ways the unit integrates warfighting functions into operations. The battle captain assists the COS or XO in synchronizing the staff and current operations. 9-14. The battle captain has the overall responsibility for the smooth functioning of the CP facility and its staff elements. This range of responsibility includes, but is not limited to— Chapter 9 9-4 FM 6-0 0D\ z Maintaining continuous operations of the CP. z Battle tracking the current situation. z Ensuring that all stations maintain communications and that they route and log all messages and reports per the SOP. z Assisting the COS or XO with information management and coordination of CP staff functions to ensure a smooth and continuous information flow between the staff sections of the CP. z Processing and gathering relevant incoming tactical and logistics data and providing that as information to the CP staff. z Tracking commander’s critical information requirements and providing recommendations to the commander and COS or XO. z Sending reports to higher echelon headquarters and ensuring staffs pass relevant information to subordinate units. z Providing security for the CP, including physical security and maintenance of noise and light discipline. z Ensuring mobility of the CP, including configuration, equipment, and training that facilitates rapid movement. z Conducting CP battle drills and enforcing the CP SOP. Battle Noncommissioned Officer (Assistant Operations Sergeant) 9-15. The assistant operations sergeant or shift NCO in charge works in the COIC and assists the battle captain and operations sergeant major in ensuring the CP runs efficiently. The assistant operations sergeant duties include, but are not limited to— z Assisting the battle captain as required. z Receiving information, monitoring the situation, and updating the common operational picture (COP). z Ensuring that staffs distribute reports and messages properly. z Supervising the publication of orders and graphics. z Supervising all the enlisted personnel in the current operations cell during shifts. z Managing guard rosters, sleep plans, and shift schedules. z Supervising journal clerks, radio-telephone operators, and computer operators in recording, disseminating, and posting information. Liaison Officer 9-16. Some CPs provide or receive liaison personnel who help coordinate, synchronize, and plan operations. Outgoing and incoming liaison personnel and teams require their own transportation and communications links to their parent headquarters. Liaison teams require a foreign language capability when working with non-English-speaking allies or partners. The liaison officer (LNO) or NCO represents the commander at the headquarters of another unit for coordinating and promoting cooperation between the units. LNOs require clearly defined duties and responsibilities. Minimum selection criteria for LNOs include— z Knowledge of the tactical situation. z An ability to communicate effectively (language capability as required). z Other specific criteria required by the mission. (See Chapter 3 for more a detailed discussion of liaison.) Digital Master Gunner 9-17. Digital master gunners are the commander’s subject matter experts regarding operations, maintenance, integration, and training for the information systems that generate the COP for the commander and staff. Because of the proliferation of technology in CPs, commanders assign trained and certified digital master gunners to CPs. A digital master gunner duties include, but are not limited to— Command Post Operations 0D\ FM 6-0 9-5 z Integrating CP C2 systems. z Assisting in establishing the CP network. z Troubleshooting C2 systems architecture. z Assisting the COP manager in developing the COP. z Implementing a unit individual digital training program. z Maintaining information systems. z Managing the digital crew roster. z Advising the commander on capabilities and limitations of digital systems in support of mission requirements. Note. The Mission Command Center of Excellence on Fort Leavenworth, Kansas offers a Mission Command Digital Master Gunner Course. For more information, go to the Mission Command Center of Excellence website at https://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe. Common Operational Picture Manager 9-18. An effective technique for managing the COP in the CP involves designating a COP manager. The COP manager has a high degree of attention to detail, experience working with C2 systems and CPs, computer skills, intelligence expertise, and specific knowledge. This knowledge includes relevant doctrinal publications such as ADP 5-0 and ADP 6-0.The COP manager works for the battle captain. The COP manager’s duties include, but are not limited to— z Being responsible for all information displayed as the COP. z Updating unit locations and events through the digital component of the COP. z Updating unit locations and events on the analog COP. z Coordinating with other staff sections for COP manipulation during briefings. z Receiving guidance from the command group on specific views or manipulations of the COP for situational understanding purposes. z Ensuring redundancy with analog COP or battle tracking. Request for Information Manager 9-19. Units are not typically manned for a request for information (RFI) manager; however, commanders should identify one to aid in conducting effective CP operations. This individual is usually in the current operations cell and has responsibility for managing RFIs. The RFI manager serves as a single point of contact for incoming and outgoing RFIs. This manager consolidates RFIs generated from the unit CP and its subordinate elements and distributes them to the appropriate element for answers. The RFI manager works directly for the battle captain. Primary responsibilities of the RFI manager are to— z Track and maintain RFIs on some type of tracker. All RFIs include a suspense date for return to the RFI manager. z Capture command group RFIs and produce appropriate RFI slides to brief at a daily plans update briefing for battle rhythm meetings. z Brief the battle captain on any critical or short-suspense RFIs received. z Close out all RFI actions on the tracking log. Enlisted Soldiers 9-20. Positions inside a CP often have enlisted Soldiers filling them. These Soldiers serve as vehicle operators, systems maintainers, radio operators, security personnel, and other critical personnel who enable the administrative functioning of the CP. These Soldiers receive training in their duties and the duties of the next senior person in their cell or section. Enlisted Soldiers assist in battle tracking, build situational understanding, and enable battle captains and NCOs to maintain a COP for the commander. Chapter 9 9-6 FM 6-0 0D\ ESTABLISH THE COMMAND POST 9-21. Commanders ensure that CP SOPs include general guidelines for establishing the CP. These particular SOPs address CP site selection and priorities for work for the CP setup. Command Post Site Selection 9-22. Selecting the right location to position a CP is critical to its survivability. Poor placement can result in limited flexibility, limited mobility, enemy detection, degraded survivability, and reduced effectiveness. 9-23. Commanders select a CP location by conducting a mission variable analysis. They consider mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations, and informational considerations—known as METT-TC (I). After the analysis, they conduct a leader’s reconnaissance of the potential site. If the situation does not allow for a leader’s reconnaissance, CP staff can use available information system resources such as line-of-site analysis tools and satellite imagery. Considerations for selecting a CP location include, but are not limited to— z Establishing security. z Using communications ability with higher echelon, subordinate, and adjacent headquarters. z Determining the range of enemy weapon systems. z Gaining accessibility to passable entry and departure points (even in poor weather). z Using terrain for passive security (including cover and concealment). z Avoiding prominent terrain features (including hilltops and crossroads). z Co-locating with tactical units for mutual support and local security. z Exercising C2 over subordinate and supporting units. Note. Access to civilian communications and information systems, especially when conducting stability operations, may be important to consider when positioning the CP. At higher echelons, maintaining communications with the host nation, the home station, and other Service and force components also influences communications when deciding on CP locations. 9-24. Built-up areas can be good locations for CPs because they provide cover and concealment, access to electricity and other services, and adequate ingress and regress routes. However, such areas can put indigenous populations at risk and can provide enemy units with covered and concealed positions to monitor and attack the CP. Priorities of Work for Command Post Setup 9-25. When erecting a CP, staffs follow priorities of work. Priorities of work for CP setup, when trained and written into unit SOPs, improve setup times, promote uniformity, and reduce missed steps. 9-26. Setting up a CP is a team effort. Responsibility for the CP setup typically goes to the operations sergeant major or the senior NCO. During the CP setup process, all personnel fall under the control of the senior NCO to ensure quick and efficient setup operations. Prior to establishing the CP, units train all personnel in setting up the CP in both internal and external configurations so they can set up the CP quickly. CP setup may vary with the size and mission of the CP. However, CP setup priorities of work generally follow this listed order: z Priority 1 – Clear the site and establish security. z Priority 2 – Occupy the site. z Priority 3 – Establish tactical voice communications. z Priority 4 – Emplace the CP infrastructure. z Priority 5 – Emplace camouflage. z Priority 6 – Set up power generation grid and install power. z Priority 7 – Set up internal equipment (tables, chairs, lights, and map boards). z Priority 8 – Emplace and install networking and data equipment. Command Post Operations 0D\ FM 6-0 9-7 z Priority 9 – Install C2 systems. z Priority 10 – Establish sleeping and mess areas. z Priority 11 – Improve defensive positions. BATTLE RHYTHM 9-27. Unit SOPs normally provide a standard battle rhythm in which a unit expects to operate. A CP’s battle rhythm consists of a series of meetings (including working groups and boards), briefings, reports, and other activities synchronized by time and purpose. (See Chapter 4 for a detailed discussion of battle rhythm.) 9-28. SOPs for a CP detail several characteristics for a battle rhythm. These include, but are not limited to— z Enabled commander’s decision making. z A routine staff interaction and coordination. z Interaction between the commander and staff. z Staff synchronization across time, space, and purpose. z Planning by the staff. Command Post Shifts 9-29. Exercising C2 during continuous operations requires the CP to operate effectively and efficiently. CP personnel will not function efficiently under the stress of continuous operations without established work cycles that allow adequate rest periods. To provide this rest and accomplish the continuous operations requirement, CPs establish designated work shifts for available personnel. 9-30. Unit manning documents are designed to provide continuous operations. Units organize available personnel to provide effective continuous operations. Establishing shifts provides enough personnel to operate the CP and the required expertise to make decisions on major issues. Units organize shifts using the standard shift, heavy or light shift, and stagger shift techniques. (See table 9-1 for pros and cons of each method.) Table 9-1. Command post shift methods Shift method Advantages Disadvantages Standard x Simple x Standardized x Balances x Shift leaders x Lacks flexibility x Breaks in continuity x Possibly absent key personnel Heavy or light x Key personnel available when needed x Flexible schedule x Shift leaders x Disruptive sleep plans x Lacks balance x Breaks in continuity Staggered x Continuity of operations x Balanced x Adds complexity x Lacks fixed shift x Lacks fixed feeding schedule 9-31. The standard shift evenly divides available personnel based on staff function and expertise. This method provides standardized teams, enhanced teamwork, and simplicity. The disadvantages are a break in the continuity of operations during shift change and possible absence of a key staff officer when needed. Adequate shift change procedures reduce continuity problems. 9-32. A variation of the standard shift is the heavy or light shift. This method places most personnel on duty when significant activity is ongoing or anticipated. For example, if conducting most operations at night, the heavy shift may be during the hours of darkness. The light shift consists of fewer Soldiers with those who are off duty remaining on call. This method provides flexibility based on mission requirements and the presence of key personnel when needed. Chapter 9 9-8 FM 6-0 0D\ 9-33. The staggered shift staggers the times that personnel come on and off duty. Each Soldier works a shift length based on section and duty requirements. In the staggered shift change, personnel are scheduled on overlapping shifts so that the new shift element has access to a body of knowledge four to six hours old. This method precludes a break in the continuity of operations, but it may be more complex to manage and support. Figure 9-1 depicts a staggered shift. Figure 9-1. Staggered shift diagram 9-34. Regardless of the method used, several considerations apply. The commander and key leaders are not placed on a duty shift. For example, the brigade XO is second in command and works as necessary. Personnel who do not work permanently in the CP are not integral parts of a duty shift. This includes LNOs and any attached special staff officers who are unit leaders or commanders. Additionally, members of the command group and the tactical CP are not included. These personnel integrate into the existing manning schedules when present at the main CP for an extended period. A replacement officer or NCO are excellent choices for augmentation shift. Shift-Change Briefings 9-35. To ensure uninterrupted operations and shared understanding, staffs conduct a briefing when the shifts change. The shift-change briefing provides a mechanism to exchange information periodically among CP staff members. Depending on the situation, it may be formal or informal, and it may include the entire staff or selected staff members. Key CP leaders normally meet face-to-face. The COS or XO oversees the briefing with participants briefing their areas of expertise. The commander may attend and possibly change the focus of the briefing. If the commander issues guidance or makes a decision, issuing a fragmentary order may be necessary. The briefing’s purpose is to inform the incoming shift of— z The current unit status. z The significant activities that occurred during the previous shift. z The significant decisions and events anticipated during the next shift. 9-36. The shift-change briefing format and emphasis can change based on the situation. For example, the format for a force conducting stability tasks differs from the format of a force conducting offensive Command Post Operations 0D\ FM 6-0 9-9 operations. To facilitate a quick but effective shift-change briefing, unit SOPs should contain tailored formats. Some criteria that facilitate effective shift-change briefings are— z A dedicated briefing area. z A check that all incoming shift key personnel are present. z An identified recorder. z Submission of information slides to the battle captain in a timely manner. z An accounting for all CP cells. z A discussion of security, reporting procedures, CP organization, information management issues, resupply operations, and maintenance. z An assurance that each CP cell NCO conducts an internal shift-change briefing. z Establishment of criteria to wake senior leaders when their presence is required. z Establishment of a plan to update senior leaders after rest periods. 9-37. The optimal way to ensure shared understanding and situational awareness for smaller echelon CPs at battalions and lower echelons is by conducting the shift-change briefing face-to-face and in person while typically situated in the COIC. For larger echelon CPs at brigade and above, conducting the shift-change briefing over the digital C2 systems is a technique that takes into consideration the distributed nature of the CP personnel in a significantly larger CP infrastructure. COMMAND POST BATTLE DRILLS 9-38. Each CP requires the implementation of battle drills to react to a variety of situations that may be encountered while conducting operations. A battle drill is a collective action performed without the application of a deliberate decision-making process. A battle drill is initiated on a cue, such as an enemy action or a leader’s command, and is a trained response to a given stimulus. A battle drill requires minimal leader orders to accomplish. Synchronization and reaction speed are enhanced when the unit SOP defines battle drills and their required reactions, and when units rehearse the battle drills during training. (See Appendix E for more information on command post battle drills.) BUILDING AND MAINTAINING SITUATIONAL UNDERSTANDING 9-39. Success in CP operations demands timely and effective decisions based on applying judgment to available information and knowledge. A common function of all CPs is to build and maintain situational understanding. Conducting knowledge and information activities, such as maintaining running estimates, performing focused battle tracking, and managing the COP, enables staffs to provide knowledge to commanders. Staffs provide this knowledge as recommendations to help commanders build and maintain their situational understanding while exercising C2. Knowledge Management and Information Management 9-40. During continuous operations, a CP receives large amounts of data and information. In turn, the CP staff performs knowledge and information activities to find the relevant information in the large amounts of data and information available. Through analysis and running estimates, staffs perform battle tracking and manage the COP to help commanders understand situations, make and implement decisions, control operations, and assess progress. Units facilitate situational understanding through knowledge and information management when they create, organize, apply, and transfer knowledge to help develop and maintain an accurate COP. (See Chapter 5 and ATP 6-01.1 for more information on knowledge management and information management.) Running Estimates 9-41. Each CP cell and staff section maintains a running estimate. A running estimate is a continuous assessment of current operations used to determine if the current operation is proceeding according to the commander’s intent and if planned future operations are supportable. The commander and each staff section continuously consider the effect of new information and update— Chapter 9 9-10 FM 6-0 0D\ z Facts. z Assumptions. z Friendly-force status. z Enemy activity and capabilities. z Civil considerations. z Conclusions and recommendations. 9-42. Running estimates never stop, and they must be maintained continuously and redundantly during each activity of the operations process. They provide valuable input into the COP during operations because they aid in depicting key information as it relates to both current and future operations. An accurate COP coupled with input from comprehensive running estimates directly supports situational understanding by enhancing the commander’s ability to visualize and make decisions during operations. Staffs tailor the format of running estimates so the commander, staff, and subordinate, higher, and adjacent units can easily understand them. Often this requires adding a visual or graphic that supports the displayed information. (For more information on the running estimate and an example of a generic running estimate, see FM 5-0.) Battle Tracking 9-43. Battle tracking is the process of building and maintaining an overall picture of an operational environment that is accurate, timely, and relevant. This process combines receiving, processing, analyzing, and monitoring information into a cohesive image that assists the commander in visualizing the current and future states of friendly and enemy operations. Accurate battle tracking enables the commander to make informed decisions and focus resources decisively. 9-44. The simplest form of battle tracking is the mental and graphic picture built and maintained by using maps, observations, and running estimates. At higher levels, battle tracking is more complex and takes advantage of digital information systems using multiple sources to generate a coherent picture of an operational environment. 9-45. Battle tracking adds meaning to relevant information by formatting, plotting, translating, correlating, aggregating, organizing, categorizing, analyzing, and evaluating it to create the COP. Successful battle tracking underpins building and maintaining situational understanding. CPs employ both analog and digital battle tracking. Analog Battle Tracking 9-46. Analog battle tracking requires the CP staff to manually update the COP using tangible tracking tools. These tools can include— z Situation maps and imagery. z Overlays and graphics. z Markers and whiteboards. z Push pins and sticky notes. z Battle boards and status charts. z Hard copies of orders. z Frequency modulated radios. Figure 9-2 shows how an analog battle tracking system with maps, overlays, and status charts may be organized. Command Post Operations 0D\ FM 6-0 9-11 Figure 9-2. Example of an analog battle tracking system Digital Battle Tracking 9-47. Digital battle tracking employs integrated digital C2 systems that combine real-time situational awareness with a visualization capability to develop the COP.The primary tools used to perform digital battle tracking can include— z Global Command and Control System–Army (known as GCCS-A). z Command post of the future (known as CPOF) or command post computing environment (known as CPCE). z Force XXI Battle Command, brigade and below (known as FBCB2). z Joint Battle Command Platform (known as JBC-P). z Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (known as AFATDS). z Air and missile defense workstation (known as AMDWS). z Distributed Common Ground System–Army (known as DCGS-A). z Full motion video (one system remote video terminal). z Web portal. z PowerPoint. z Audiovisual equipment. z Digital radios. 9-48. Staffs document, train, rehearse, and understand battle tracking methods in the CP SOP. Additionally, digital system redundancy is necessary, but so are the analog capabilities if digital interfaces fail or the CP is on the move. In the event that digital battle tracking systems are inoperable or unavailable, CPs must be able to continue battle tracking in the analog mode. Therefore, staffs need to use and update both systems simultaneously. Common Operational Picture 9-49. In a CP, the COP is the end product of knowledge and information activities, running estimates, and battle tracking. It is designed around the commander’s requirements, is based on shared information, and facilitates collaborative planning and the achievement of situational understanding. 9-50. Although the COP is ideally a single display in the CP, it may include more than one display and information in other forms, such as graphical representations or written reports. Commanders achieve Chapter 9 9-12 FM 6-0 0D\ situational understanding by applying judgment to the COP. Relevant information provides the basis for constructing the COP, and it primarily consists of information that the staff provides through analysis and evaluation. Data and information from CPs at all echelons and shared among users is used to create the COP. Some sources of this information include reports, running estimates, and information provided by LNOs. (For more information on the COP, see ADP 6-0.) COMMAND POST DISPLACEMENT 9-51. Commanders consider the mission variables to determine CP displacement. The mission variables— mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations, and informational considerations—are also known as METT-TC (I). Because displacements can be both planned and unplanned, a CP must maintain a readiness posture to displace on short notice. Unit SOPs that cover all aspects of displacement help to maintain a heightened state of readiness to displace. 9-52. The main CP displaces in either a single or phased move. The method selected depends on the mission variables, distance to be moved, and communications requirements. Critical aspects of C2, such as contact with higher echelon headquarters and subordinate units, must be maintained during displacement. Commanders plan displacements to ensure the main CP is stationary during critical phases of the battle. 9-53. Timely and efficient CP displacement is a function of training, SOPs, and rehearsals. A unit’s SOP covers all aspects of displacement from triggers for displacement to vehicle load plans. Developers of SOPs for CP displacement consider— z The mission variables. This helps to assess the threat situation and determine probability of air or ground attack. z Timelines for the preparation and movement of the main CP. z Marshalling area to organize the march column and conduct final inspections and briefings. z The establishment of detailed security measures, including rehearsing actions on contact drills and conducting a convoy. z The movement route, including the start point, required checkpoints, rally points, and the release point. Additional control measures the team might need to identify include critical areas, defiles, choke points, rest and maintenance stops, and danger areas. z Quartering party organization, briefing, and dispatching. z March speed, movement formations, vehicle and serial intervals, catch-up speed, lighting, and times of critical events. z Order of march. Key headquarters positions in the order of march must enable continuous C2 and maximum protection using available combat assets. z Use of multiple serials based on the size of the organization. z Indirect fire support and contingency actions, and actions on contact rehearsals. z Contingency plans covering vehicle breakdowns, lost vehicles, and accidents. z Sustainment, including refueling, mess operations, vehicle recovery, military police assistance, and medical evacuation. z Preparation and issuance of an order upon completion of the planning tasks. z Tasks required to transfer C2 functions to the alternate CP. COMMAND POST SECURITY AND DEFENSE 9-54. Effective CP security and defense SOPs integrate many security measures to ensure that personnel, information, infrastructure, and facilities are protected from enemy attack. Security and defensive measures must be established based on an assessment of the full range of threats, including enemy conventional forces, terrorists, insurgents, organized criminal elements, and insiders. CPs for corps and divisions may require an augmentation security force. 9-55. Establishing a CP within a base camp is an effective security and defense technique. For example, after the initial U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Army forces inhabited existing hardened and semi-hardened facilities and established base camps as locations from which to conduct continuous operations. From 2004 until 2011, Command Post Operations 0D\ FM 6-0 9-13 the joint operations center for Multi-National Force-Iraq occupied Al Faw Palace located within the Victory Base Complex. 9-56. In terms of basic characteristics, functions, and operations, base camps and CPs are very similar. They both have a defined perimeter, are usually self-reliant for protection, and may serve a specific purpose or be multifunctional. The techniques and principles outlined in ATP 3-37.10 have proven successful to securing and defending base camps and this applies to CP operations. LAYERED APPROACH FRAMEWORK 9-57. The CP security and defense capabilities are best deployed using a layered approach such as the one described in ATP 3-37.10. A layered defense provides strength and depth and reduces the destructive effect from any single attack through the dissipation of energy or the culmination of the attacking force. The defense in depth technique provides time for the CP defense forces to assess, decide, and respond. 9-58. The layered framework for establishing CP security and defense capabilities consists of three areas visually depicted in figure 9-3. These three areas are the outer security area, the perimeter zone, and the inner security area. Figure 9-3. Framework for command post security and defense The Outer Security Area 9-59. The outer security area is the area outside the perimeter that typically extends to the limit of available direct fire weapons. Commanders establish an outer security area to provide early warning and reaction time and to deny enemy reconnaissance efforts and vantage points for conducting standoff attacks. The outer security area includes the emplacement of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear detectors with alarms if chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear is a condition of the battlefield. The outer security area is typically patrolled by mobile or on-foot security elements. Chapter 9 9-14 FM 6-0 0D\ The Perimeter Zone 9-60. The perimeter zone includes the CP perimeter and area immediately in front or behind it. The perimeter zone contains observation posts, fighting positions, and early entry command posts. The Inner Security Area 9-61. The inner security area is inside the CP perimeter. Interior barrier plans can be used around individual CP facilities and critical assets. Units can also use these plans as traffic control measures to add depth to the CP security plan and to halt or impede the progress of threat penetrations of the perimeter zone. 9-62. Commanders and their staffs apply the framework for CP security and defense to focus their planning activities and ensure all critical elements of CP security and defense are addressed. The framework is not intended as an all-inclusive solution to CP security and defense, but it is intended to provide a general template for planning. The CP security and defense plan must ensure adequate protection with as small a force as necessary to avoid diminishing operations and without impeding staff sections from performing their primary mission tasks. (See ATP 3-37.10 for more information on CP security and defense.) LAYERED APPROACH CONSIDERATIONS 9-63. Prior to implementing the layered approach, planners should also consider— z The ability to provide early warning. z The positioning of key weapon systems and development of range cards and sector sketches. z The designation of final protective lines and final protective fires. z The clearing of fields of fire. z The preparing of hasty or deliberate fighting and survivability positions. z The emplacing of protective obstacles and barriers. z Entry and access control points and procedures. z The assurance of redundant communications means. z The rehearsing of reactions to contact, rules of engagement, casualty evacuation, and the use of response forces. z The continuation of improving the defense based on continuous threat and vulnerability assessments. COMMAND POST LIFE SUPPORT 9-64. The pace of continuous operations will inevitably cause stress on the CP staff. Without a life support SOP in place, both personnel and equipment performance will degrade quickly. CP life support during continuous operations includes managing— z Daily operations. z Field safety. z Equipment maintenance. z Power management. z Fuel consumption. z Environmental impacts. DAILY OPERATIONS 9-65. In a CP, daily operations are those routine tasks that must be accomplished from day to day to ensure efficient and continuous operations. Typically, the operations sergeant major has overall responsibility for ensuring that all CP daily duties get accomplished. These duties include— z Re-fueling operations (generators, heaters, stoves, and vehicles). z Policing inside and outside the CP. z Conducting logistics package operations. Command Post Operations 0D\ FM 6-0 9-15 z Adhering to and enforcing the CP rules. z Conducting daily health care and hygiene activities. z Checking the wind lines on CP tents and communications antennae to ensure that they are secure. z Performing daily maintenance on C2 systems, computers, and printers. z Performing preventive maintenance checks and services on CP equipment. z Shredding all classified and unclassified documentation. z Visually inspecting electrical grounding, cables, and connections. z Conducting field mess operations. z Executing rest plans. FIELD SAFETY 9-66. Continuous operations are inherently hazardous. All operations involve placing individuals in and around large equipment, weapons systems, and difficult terrain. Prior to conducting CP operations, leaders develop a safety SOP at each echelon and implement it. Safety is everyone’s responsibility. Leaders emphasize safety and make on-the-spot corrections. Prior to conducting CP operations, leaders create SOPs that identify, assess, and mitigate hazards in (at a minimum) these areas: z Vehicle operations. z Mounting and dismounting equipment. z Maintenance. z Electrical safety. z Weapons systems safety. z Fire safety. z Sleeping area safety. z Extreme weather. EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE 9-67. Proper maintenance is the key to keeping CP vehicles, equipment, and other materials serviceable. It is a continuous process that starts with preventive measures taken by each operator and continues through repair and recovery efforts by higher-level maintenance personnel. It includes services involved in inspecting, testing, servicing, repairing, requisitioning, recovering, and evacuating equipment. 9-68. Preventive maintenance checks and services are the foundations of field-level maintenance. Preventive maintenance as a system includes all checks and services performed by the operator or crew and the field maintenance section. It is performed in order to identify and correct faults as well as perform required services on all assigned equipment. (See DA PAM 750-3 for more information on maintenance, as it provides a single “go-to” reference for field maintenance operations.) POWER MANAGEMENT 9-69. Electric power is critical to the success of CP operations since units rely on it extensively to run many of their equipment and support systems. The Army-fielded standardized integrated CP system is powered differently from previous versions. Rather than each particular system running on its own generator, the CP systems are collectively powered from a single source. This concept is called central power. A power plant provides power which is supplied to the equipment through a network of cables and distribution equipment. Key components to effective power management are— z Selecting a power source. z Setting up power generators (including use of phases, wiring, loading, physical location, and sun shade). z Grounding power sources and electrical components. z Distributing the power. Chapter 9 9-16 FM 6-0 0D\ Note. If available, reliable commercial power is a good choice when a CP is at a long halt. FUEL CONSUMPTION 9-70. Field CPs rely heavily on power generation equipment to sustain continuous operations. Power generation equipment provides the electricity for lighting, cooling, heating, computers, networking equipment, and other life support systems. Power generation equipment and CP vehicles require fuel to operate. CPs carefully manage fuel supplies, resupply, and consumption so they can conduct effective and sustained CP operations. 9-71. Typically a CP will have fueling vehicles that are assigned by its table of organization and equipment (known as TO&E). The basic load of fuel for the CP is the hauling capacity of its fuel vehicles, including the vehicles’ fuel tanks. Topping off vehicles and equipment whenever possible is essential to continuous operations. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 9-72. Certain areas of CP operations require particular attention to avoid environmental impacts and to protect health and quality of life. Environmental considerations during CP operations include— z Field sanitation. z Hazardous material storage, transportation, treatment, redistribution or reuse, and safeguarding. z Spill response and reporting. z Storage, distribution, and safeguarding of petroleum, oils, and lubricants. z Integrated waste management, including the collection, transportation, storage, separation, recycling, treatment, and disposal of solid waste, black water (feces and urine), gray water (other wastewater from sinks or baths), hazardous waste, special waste, medical waste, and explosive waste. z Latrine and shower facility locations. z Dining facility locations. z Motor pool and maintenance locations. CONCLUSION 9-73. As discussed, the situation, mission, duration, and intensity of operations are variables that will impact continuous CP operations. Rehearsing SOPs, performing battle drills, and becoming proficient in setup and teardown of the CP makes an organization more efficient in CP operations. The CP is an integral component to successful C2 for all operations. 0D\ FM 6-0 A-1 Appendix A Staff Studies and Decision Papers This appendix explains staff studies and decision papers. It provides formats, instructions, and examples for the preparations for both. It concludes with instructions on coordination and a list of common problems. STAFF STUDIES A-1. A staff study is a detailed formal report to a decision maker requesting action on a recommendation. It provides the information and methodology used to solve a problem. A staff study includes an official memorandum for the commander’s signature that implements the action. The leader coordinates staff studies with all affected organizations. Staff studies include statements of nonconcurrence, if applicable, so that the decision maker clearly understands all staff members’ support for the recommendation. A staff study is comprehensive; it includes all relevant information needed to solve the problem and a complete description of the methodology used to arrive at the recommended solution. A-2. Staff studies follow the seven-step Army problem-solving process. This ensures that the staff clearly identifies the problem, follows a logical sequence, and produces a justifiable solution. (See FM 5-0 for more information on the Army problem-solving process.) A-3. The body of a completed staff study is a stand-alone document. While enclosures are a part of most staff studies, a decision maker should not have to refer to them to understand the recommendation and the basis for it. Enclosures contain details and supporting information and help keep the body of the study concise. THE STAFF STUDY FORMAT A-4.Staff officers prepare staff studies as informal memorandums in the format found in figure A-1. Units may establish their own format to meet local requirements. (See AR 25-50 for more information on memorandums.) Figure A-1. Staff study paper format example Office Symbol Date MEMORANDUM FOR Address the staff study to the decision maker. Include through addressees if required. SUBJECT: Succinctly describe the subject to distinguish it from other documents as a courtesy to the decision maker. Do not simply state “staff study” as this does not provide sufficient detail, nor does it convey any information about the subject. 1. PROBLEM. Concisely state the problem. 2. RECOMMENDATION. Recommend a solution or solutions based on the conclusion in paragraph 10. If there are several recommendations, state each one in a separate subparagraph. 3. BACKGROUND. Briefly state why the problem exists. Provide enough information to place the problem in context. This discussion may include the origin of the action and a summary of related events. If a tasking document is the source of the problem, place it in enclosure 2 and refer to it here. Appendix A A-2 FM 6-0 0D\ Figure A-1. Staff study paper format example (continued) Office Symbol (Marks Number) SUBJECT: Briefly state the decision’s subject. 4. FACTS. State all facts that influence the problem or its solution. List each fact as a separate subparagraph. Make sure to state the facts precisely and attribute them correctly. Facts must stand-alone: either something is a generally accepted fact or it is attributed to a source that asserts it to be true. There is no limit to the number of facts as long as every fact is relevant. Include all facts relevant to the problem, not just facts used to support the study. The decision maker must have an opportunity to consider facts that do not support the recommendation. State any guidance given by the decision maker. Refer to enclosures as necessary for amplification, references, mathematical formulas, or tabular data. 5. ASSUMPTIONS. Identify assumptions necessary for a logical discussion of the problem. List each assumption as a separate subparagraph. 6. POSSIBLE SOLUTION. List all solutions considered. Place each solution in a separate subparagraph. List each solution by number and name or as a short sentence in the imperative (for example, “Increase physical security measures at key assets.”). If a solution is not self-explanatory, include a brief description of it. Use enclosures to describe complex solutions. 7. CRITERIA. List and define, in separate subparagraphs, the screening and evaluation criteria. A fact or an assumption in paragraph 4 or 5 should support each criterion. At a minimum, the number of facts and assumptions should exceed the number of criteria. In a third subparagraph, explain the rationale for how the evaluation criteria are weighted. a. Screening Criteria. List the screening criteria, each in its own sub-subparagraph. Screening criteria define the minimum and maximum characteristics of the solution to the problem. Answer each screening criterion: Is it suitable, feasible, acceptable, distinguishable, and complete? Screening criteria are not weighted. They are required, absolute standards. Reject courses of action that do not meet the screening criteria. b. Evaluation Criteria. List the evaluation criteria, each in its own sub-subparagraph. List them in order of their weight from most to least important. Define each evaluation criterion in terms of five required elements: short title, definition, unit of measure, benchmark, and formula. c.
Weighting of Criteria. State the relative importance of each evaluation criterion with respect to the others. Explain how each criterion compares to each of the other criteria (equal, slightly favored, favored, or strongly favored) or provide the values from the decision matrix and explain why the criterion is measured in that way. This subparagraph explains the order in which the evaluation criteria are listed in subparagraph 7b. 8. ANALYSIS. List the courses of action that do not meet the screening criteria and the results of applying the evaluation criteria to the remaining ones. a. Screened Out Courses of Action. List the courses of action that did not meet the screening criteria, each in its own subparagraph, and the screening criteria each did not meet. This subparagraph is particularly important if a solution the decision maker wanted to be considered does not meet the screening. b. Course of Action 1. In subsequent subparagraphs, list the courses of action evaluated, each in a separate subparagraph. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each solution. For quantitative criteria, include the payoff value. Discuss or list advantages and disadvantages in narratives. Use the form that best fits the information. Avoid using bullets unless the advantage or disadvantage is self-evident. (1) Advantages. List the advantages for course of action 1. (2) Disadvantages. List the disadvantages for course of action 1.

List the disadvantages for course of action 2. 9. COMPARISON. Compare the courses of action to each other, based on the analysis outlined in paragraph 8. Develop the rationale used to reach the conclusion stated in paragraph 10 in a logical, orderly manner. If leaders use quantitative techniques in the comparison, summarize the results clearly enough that the reader does not have to refer to an enclosure. Include any explanations of quantitative techniques in enclosures. State only the results in this paragraph. 10. CONCLUSION. State the conclusion drawn based on the analysis (paragraph 8) and comparison (paragraph 9). The conclusion must answer the question or provide a possible solution to the problem. It must match the recommendation in paragraph 2. 11. COORDINATION. List all organizations with which the study was coordinated (“staffed”). If the list is long and space is a consideration, place it at enclosure 3. If the staffing list is placed in enclosure 3, indicate the number of nonconcurrences with the cross-reference (for example, “See enclosure 3; 2 nonconcurrences.”; or “See enclosure 3; no nonconcurrences.”). A representative of each organization with which the study was staffed indicates whether the organization concurs with the study, nonconcurs, or concurs with comment (CMT). Representatives place their initials in the blank, followed by their rank, name, position, telephone number, and email address. If separate copies were sent to each organization (rather than sending one copy to each organization in turn), this information may be typed into the final copy of the study and the actual replies placed in enclosure 4. Recommend this technique when using email for staffing. Place all statements of nonconcurrence and considerations of nonconcurrence in enclosure 3, or in separate enclosures for each nonconcurrence. Concurrences with comments may be placed in enclosure 3 or in a separate enclosure or enclosures.

Place concurrences with comment in either enclosure 4 or a separate enclosure. If there are no statements of nonconcurrence, enter “Not used” in the enclosure list in the body (Tab D). 5. Other supporting documents, listed as separate enclosures. Other enclosures contain detailed data, lengthy discussions, and bibliographies. Number the pages of each enclosure separately, except when an enclosure contains several distinct documents (such as, concurrences) (Tabs E through Z, if necessary). Figure A-1. Staff study paper format example (continued) COORDINATING STAFF STUDIES A-5. Preparing a staff study normally involves coordinating with other staff officers and organizations. At a minimum, action officers obtain concurrences or nonconcurrences from agencies affected by the study’s recommendations. Other aspects of the study may require coordination as well. Coordination should be as broad as time permits, but it should be limited to agencies that might be affected by possible recommendations or that have expertise in the subject of the study. A-6. Action officers anticipate nonconcurrences and try to resolve as many as possible before staffing the final product. An action officer who cannot resolve a nonconcurrence has two options: z Modify the staff study to satisfy the nonconcurrence, but only if the analysis and comparison supports the change. If this is done after the final draft has been staffed, the officer must re-staff the study. z Prepare a consideration of nonconcurrence and include it and the statement of nonconcurrence in enclosure 4 to the staff study. Statements of Nonconcurrence A-7. A statement of nonconcurrence is a recommendation for the decision maker to reject all or part of a staff study. Statements of nonconcurrence are prepared in the memorandum format; emails may be accepted at the commander’s discretion. Statements of nonconcurrence address specific points in the recommendations or the study, stating why the points are wrong or unacceptable. These statements offer an alternative or a constructive recommendation when possible. Considerations of Nonconcurrence A-8. Action officers prepare considerations of nonconcurrence as memorandums for record. They present the reasons for the nonconcurrence accurately and assess them objectively. Then they state why the study is correct and why the decision maker should reject the nonconcurrence. Staff Studies and Decision Papers 0D\ FM 6-0 A-5 COMMON PROBLEMS WITH STAFF STUDIES A-9. The following questions identify the most common problems found in staff studies. Leaders should ask (and consider the answers to) the following questions before beginning a staff study and periodically thereafter: z Is the subject too broad? z Is the problem properly defined? z Are facts or assumptions clear and valid? z Are there any unnecessary facts or assumptions? z Are there any facts that appear for the first time in the discussion? z Are there a limited number of options or courses of action? z Are evaluation criteria invalid or too restrictive? z Is the discussion too long? z Is the discussion complete? z Must readers consult the enclosures to understand the staff study? z Does the conclusion include a discussion? z Is the logic flawed or incomplete? z Does the conclusion follow from the analysis? z Can the solution be implemented within resource and time constraints? z Do the conclusions and recommendations solve the problem? z Is there an implementing directive? z Have new criteria been introduced in the analysis or comparison? DECISION PAPERS A-10. A decision paper is a correspondence that requests a decision maker to act on its recommendation and provides the required implementing documents for signature. Action officers use a decision paper when they do not need a formal report or when the decision maker does not require the details that a staff study provides. PREPARING DECISION PAPERS A-11. Decision papers are brief. Unlike staff studies, decision papers are not self-contained. For a decision paper, much of the material that would be included in a staff study remains in the action officer’s file. Decision papers contain the minimum information the decision maker needs to understand the action and make a decision. The action officer synthesizes the facts, summarizes the issues, presents feasible alternatives, and recommends one solution. Action officers attach essential explanations and other information as enclosures, which are always tabbed. FORMATTING DECISION PAPERS A-12. Action officers prepare decision papers as informal memorandums in the format shown in figure A-2 beginning on page A-6. This format also parallels the steps of the Army problem-solving process. Commands may establish format standards to meet local requirements. Decision papers should not exceed two pages, excluding the staffing list and supporting documentation. The coordination requirements for a decision paper are the same as those for a staff study. (See FM 5-0 for the Army problem-solving process. See AR 25-50 for more information on memorandums.) Appendix A A-6 FM 6-0 0D\ Office Symbol (Marks Number) Date MEMORANDUM FOR Address the decision paper to the decision maker. Include through addressees or routing slip, as specified by command policy. SUBJECT: Briefly state the decision’s subject. Be specific so the reader does not have to read the body of the decision paper to figure out the subject. “Decision paper” is not an acceptable subject. 1. FOR DECISION. Indicate if the decision is time-sensitive, tied to an event, or has a suspense date to a higher headquarters. Show internal suspense dates on the routing slip, if necessary. However, do not show them in this paragraph. (Paragraph headings may be either underlined or bolded, according to command policy.) 2. PURPOSE. State clearly the decision required, as an infinitive phrase. An infinitive phrase uses a verb, but has no subject, for example, “To determine the...,” or, “To obtain...,” Include in the purpose statement who, what, when, and where, if pertinent. 3.

As discussed, a staff study is comprehensive; it includes all relevant information needed to solve the problem and a complete description of the methodology used to arrive at the recommended solution. Doing this ensures that the staff clearly identifies the problem, follows a logical sequence, and produces a justifiable solution. Unlike staff studies, decision papers are not self-contained. Decision papers contain the minimum information the decision maker needs to understand the action and make a decision. Together, they allow the staff to assist the commander in making informed decisions. This page intentionally left blank. 0D\ FM 6-0 B-1 Appendix B Military Briefings Briefings are the most efficient and common means of presenting information to commanders, staffs, Soldiers, or other audiences. This appendix describes the four types of military briefings and the steps and instructions for their production. TYPES OF MILITARY BRIEFINGS B-1. The Army uses four types of briefings: information, decision, mission, and staff. The primary purposes of the types of briefing are— z Information – inform the audience and increase shared understanding. z Decision – obtain a decision from a commander or other decision maker. z Mission – provide information and instructions during operations. z Staff – exchange information by improving staff coordination and unity of effort. INFORMATION BRIEFING B-2. An information briefing presents facts in a form the audience can easily understand. It is the most fundamental type of briefing, but it does not include conclusions or recommendations, nor does it result in decisions. The main parts of an information briefing are the introduction, main body, and closing. Figure B-1 provides an example of an information briefing format. 1. Introduction x Greeting. Address the audience; greet key leaders and distinguished guests. Identify yourself and your organization. For example, “Good morning, Colonel Johnson, Mr. Williams, and ladies and gentlemen. I am Major Jones, Executive Officer of 1st Battalion.” x Type and Classification of Briefing. Identify the type and classification of the briefing. For example, “This is an information briefing. It is unclassified.” x Purpose and Scope. State the primary purpose of the briefing first, then elaborate on supporting themes. For example, “The purpose of this briefing is to inform members of our organization about the impact of recent changes in 1st Infantry Division policies.” x Outline or Procedure. Briefly summarize the key points and general approach. Explain any special procedures (such as demonstrations, displays, or tours). For example, “During my briefing, I will discuss the six phases of our plan. I will refer to maps of our area of operations. Then my assistant will bring out a sand table to show you the expected flow of battle.” The key points may be placed on a chart that remains visible throughout the briefing. 2. Main Body x Arrange the main ideas in a logical sequence. x Use visual aids to emphasize main points. x Plan effective transitions from one main point or topic to the next. x Be prepared to answer questions at any time. 3. Closing x Briefly recap main ideas and make a concluding statement. Figure B-1. Information briefing format example B-3. Examples of appropriate topics for information briefings include, but are not limited to— Appendix B B-2 FM 6-0 0D\ z High-priority information requiring immediate attention. z Information such as complex plans, systems, statistics or charts, or other items that require detailed explanations. z Information requiring elaboration and explanation. DECISION BRIEFING B-4. A decision briefing obtains the answer to a question or a decision on a course of action. The briefer presents recommended solutions from the analysis or study of a problem. Decision briefings vary in formality and level of detail depending on the commander’s or decision maker’s knowledge of the subject. Figure B-2 provides an example of a decision briefing format. B-5. If the decision maker is unfamiliar with the problem, the briefing format adheres to the decision briefing format. Decision briefings include all facts and assumptions relevant to the problem, a discussion of alternatives, analysis-based conclusions, and any coordination required. B-6. When the decision maker is familiar with the subject or problem, the briefing format often resembles that of a decision paper. It includes a problem statement, essential background information, impacts, and a recommended solution. Like the information briefing, the main parts of a decision briefing are the introduction, main body, and closing. The introduction includes the problem statement and recommendation. The main body addresses information relevant to making a decision. This can include assumptions, facts, alternative solutions, potential branch plans, reasons for recommendations, and any additional coordination required. The closing for a decision briefing requires the decision maker to make a decision. 1. Introduction x Greeting. Address the decision maker. Identify yourself and your organization. For example, “Good afternoon, Major General Smith. I am Lieutenant Colonel Brown, Operations Officer of 1st Cavalry Division.” x Type and Classification of Briefing. Identify the type and classification of the briefing. For example, “This is a decision briefing. It is unclassified.” x Problem Statement. State the problem. For example, “We must select and task organize a brigade combat team to fulfill requirements for a Forces Command tasking.” x Recommendation. State the recommendation. For example, “Of the three potential courses of action (COAs), we recommend using COA 1.” 2. Main Body x Facts. Provide an objective presentation of both positive and negative facts bearing upon the problem. x Assumptions. Identify necessary assumptions made to bridge any gaps in factual data. Assumptions must be validated at a later time. x Solutions. Discuss the various options that can solve the problem. x Analysis. List the screening and evaluation criteria by which the briefer will evaluate how to solve the problem. Discuss relative advantages and disadvantages for each COA. x Comparison. Show how the COAs compare against one another. x Conclusion. Describe why the recommended solution is best. 3. Closing x Briefly recap main ideas and restate the recommendation. x Ask for questions or further guidance from the decision maker(s). x If no decision is provided at the end of the decision briefing, request a decision. The briefer ensures all participants clearly understand the decision and asks for clarification if necessary. Figure B-2. Decision briefing format example B-7. In the introduction, the briefer clearly states and precisely words a recommendation presented during decision briefings to prevent ambiguity and to translate it easily into a decision statement. If the decision Military Briefings 0D\ FM 6-0 B-3 requires an implementation document, briefers present that document at the time of the briefing for the decision maker to sign. If the chief of staff or executive officer is absent, the briefer informs the secretary of the general staff or designated authority of the decision upon conclusion of the briefing. MISSION BRIEFING B-8. Mission briefings are information briefings that occur during operations or training. The purpose of a mission briefing is to secure a well-coordinated and unified effort toward accomplishing a mission. Briefers may be commanders or coordinating, special, and personnel staff members. B-9. Mission briefings serve to convey and emphasize critical mission information in the plan or order to individuals or small units. Mission briefings— z Issue or enforce an order. z Provide more detailed instructions or requirements. z Facilitate shared understanding within the unit. z May announce command decisions or the issuance of further guidance. z Review key points for an operation. z Ensure participants know the mission objective, their contribution to the operation, problems they may confront, and ways to overcome problems. B-10. The nature and content of the information provided determines the mission briefing format. Typically, a briefer will use the operation plan or operation order as a format for a mission briefing. If that is not practical, a briefer may use the information briefing format with modifications as necessary to meet the intent of the mission briefing. (See FM 5-0 for information on operation plan or operation order development and format.) STAFF BRIEFING B-11. Staff briefings inform the commander and staff of the current situation so they can coordinate and synchronize efforts within the unit. The individual convening the staff briefing sets the briefing agenda. Each staff element presents relevant information from its functional area. Staff briefings facilitate information exchange, announce decisions, issue directives, or provide guidance. The staff briefing format may include characteristics of the information briefing, decision briefing, and mission briefing. (See figure B-1 on page B-1 and figure B-2 on page B-2 for briefing formats.) B-12. The commander, deputies or assistants, chiefs of staff or executive officers, coordinating personnel, and special staff officers often attend staff briefings. Representatives from other commands may also attend. The chief of staff or executive officer often presides over the briefing. The commander may take an active role during the briefing, and the commander normally concludes the briefing. STEPS OF MILITARY BRIEFINGS B-13. Staffs normally follow four steps when preparing an effective briefing. These steps are— z Plan—analyze the situation and prepare a briefing outline. z Prepare—collect information and construct the briefing. z Execute—deliver the briefing. z Assess—follow up as required. PLAN B-14. Upon receipt of the task to conduct a briefing, the briefer analyzes the situation. The briefer determines the— z Audience. z Purpose and type of briefing. z Subject. z Classification. Appendix B B-4 FM 6-0 0D\ z Physical facilities and support needed. z Preparation timeline. z Briefing time. B-15. Based on the analysis, the briefer assembles a briefing outline and timeline. The briefing outline is the plan for the preparation, execution, and follow up for the briefing. Briefers use the timeline as a time management tool to manage briefing preparations and budget time if they need to refine the briefing as new information becomes available. B-16. Briefers consider many factors while planning a briefing, as shown in figure B-3. This planning includes, but is not limited to— z Audience preferences for information delivery, such as how the decision maker prefers to see information presented. z Time available. z Facilities and briefing aids available. 1. Audience. x What is the size and composition? Single Service or joint? Civilians? Foreign nationals? x Who are the ranking members and their official duty positions? x How well do they know the subject? x Are they generalists or specialists? x What are their interests? x What is the anticipated reaction? 2. Purpose and Type. x Information briefing (to inform)? x Decision briefing (to obtain decision)? x Mission briefing (to review important details)? x Staff briefing (to exchange information)? 3. Subject. x What is the specific subject? x What is the desired depth of coverage? x How much time is allocated? 4. Classification. x What is the security classification? x Do all attendees meet this classification? 5. Physical Facilities and Support Needed. x Where is the briefing to be presented? x What support is needed? x What are the security requirements, if needed? x What are the audiovisual equipment requirements? Computer? Projector? Screen? 6. Preparation Timeline and Schedule. x Prepare preliminary outline. x Determine requirements for training aids, assistants, and recorders. x Schedule rehearsals, facilities, and critiques. x Arrange for final review by responsible authority. Figure B-3. Planning considerations for military briefings B-17. The briefer estimates deadlines for each task and schedules the preparation effort accordingly. The briefer alerts support personnel and any assistants as soon as possible. Military Briefings 0D\ FM 6-0 B-5 PREPARE B-18. The briefing preparation varies with type and purpose, as shown in figure B-4. The analysis of the briefing determines the basis for this. Briefers follow these key steps to prepare a briefing: z Collect materials needed. z Prepare first draft. z Revise first draft and edit. z Plan use of visual aids. z Check audiovisual delivery systems (computer and other technical aids) to ensure availability and functionality. z Rehearse briefing. 1. Collect Materials Needed. x Use the seven-step Army problem-solving process. x Research. x Become familiar with the subject. x Collect authoritative opinions and facts. 2. Prepare First Draft. x Prepare draft outline. x Include visual aids. x Review with appropriate authority. 3. Revise First Draft and Edit. x Verify facts, including those that are important and necessary. x Include answers to anticipated questions. x Refine materials. 4. Plan Use of Visual Aids. x Check for simplicity. x Check for readability. 5. Check Audiovisual Delivery Systems. x Ensure availability. x Ensure functionality. 6. Practice. x Rehearse (with assistants and visual aids). x Refine. x Isolate key points. x Memorize outline. x Develop transitions. x Anticipate and prepare for possible questions. Figure B-4. Preparation considerations for military briefings EXECUTE B-19. The success of a briefing depends on a concise, objective, accurate, clearly enunciated, and forceful delivery. The briefer must also be confident and relaxed.The briefer should consider that— z The basic purpose is to present the subject as directed and ensure the audience understands it. z Brevity precludes a lengthy introduction or summary. z Conclusions and recommendations must flow logically from facts and assumptions. Appendix B B-6 FM 6-0 0D\ B-20. Interruptions and questions may occur at any point. If they occur, briefers answer each question before continuing, or they indicate that they will answer the question later in the briefing. When briefers answer questions later in the briefing, they specifically reference the earlier question when they introduce material. They anticipate possible questions and are prepared to answer them. ASSESS B-21. When the briefing is over, the briefer conducts a follow up, as required. To ensure understanding, the briefer prepares a memorandum for record. This memorandum records the subject, date, time, and location of the briefing as well as the ranks, names, and positions of audience members. The briefer concisely records the briefing’s content to help ensure understanding. The briefer records recommendations and their approval, disapproval, or approval with modification as well as instructions or directed actions. Recommendations can include who is to take action. The briefer records the decision. When a decision is involved and any ambiguity exists about the commander’s intent, the briefer submits a draft of the memorandum for record for correction before preparing the final document. Lastly, the briefer informs proper authorities. The briefer distributes the final memorandum for record to staff elements and agencies required to act on the decisions or instructions or whose plans or operations may be affected. CONCLUSION B-22. As discussed in this appendix, briefings are the most common means Army forces use to present information to commanders, staffs, Soldiers, or other audiences. The four types of military briefings listed in this appendix are examples of steps and instructions Army forces have adopted over time for the conduct of military briefings. These are not meant to be an all-inclusive checklist. Soldiers should tailor a briefing to the audience and assess the content and delivery of the briefing for future use. 0D\ FM 6-0 C-1 Appendix C Rehearsals Rehearsing key actions before execution allows Soldiers to become familiar with the operation and translate the written plan into physical actions. This appendix describes the different types and techniques of rehearsals. It lists the responsibilities of those involved and contains guidelines for conducting rehearsals. REHEARSAL BASICS C-1. A rehearsal is a session in which the commander and staff or unit practices expected actions to improve performance during execution (ADP 5-0). Rehearsals allow leaders and their Soldiers to practice key aspects of the concept of operations. These actions help Soldiers orient themselves to their environment and the planned actions of other units before executing an operation. Rehearsals help Soldiers build a lasting mental picture of the sequence of key actions within the operation. By seeing superiors’ actions, rehearsals also enable Soldiers to assume the role of their supervisor or other leaders in the chain of command if that situation were to arise. C-2. Rehearsals are the commander’s tool to ensure that staffs and subordinates understand the commander’s intent and the concept of operations. They allow commanders and staffs to identify shortcomings in the plan that have not been previously recognized. Rehearsals also contribute to external and internal coordination, as the staff identifies additional coordinating requirements. C-3. Effective and efficient units habitually rehearse during training. Commanders at every level routinely train and practice various rehearsal types. Local standard operating procedures (SOPs) identify appropriate rehearsal types and standards for their execution. Leaders conduct periodic after action reviews to ensure their units conduct rehearsals to standard and correct substandard performances. After action reviews also enable leaders to incorporate lessons learned into existing plans and orders, or into subsequent rehearsals. C-4. Adequate time is essential when conducting rehearsals. The time required varies with the complexity of the mission, the type and technique of rehearsal, and the level of participation. Units conduct rehearsals at the lowest possible level using the most thorough technique possible with the given time available. Under time-constrained conditions, leaders conduct abbreviated rehearsals, focusing on critical events determined by reverse planning. Each unit will have different critical events based on its mission, unit readiness, and the commander’s assessment. C-5. A rehearsal is a coordination event, not an analysis. It does not replace war gaming. Commanders war- game during the military decision-making process (known as MDMP) to analyze different courses of action to determine the optimal one. Rehearsals practice that selected course of action. Commanders avoid making major changes to operation orders (OPORDs) during rehearsals. They make only those changes essential to mission success and risk mitigation. REHEARSAL TYPES C-6. Each rehearsal type achieves a different result and has a specific place in the preparation timeline. The types of rehearsals are the— z Backbrief. z Combined arms rehearsal. z Support rehearsal. z Battle drill or SOP rehearsal. Appendix C C-2 FM 6-0 0D\ BACKBRIEF C-7. A backbrief is a briefing by subordinates to the commander to review how subordinates intend to accomplish their mission. Subordinates perform backbriefs throughout preparation to allow commanders to clarify intent and provide additional guidance early in subordinate planning. Commanders use the backbrief to identify any problems in the concept of operations. C-8. Backbriefs are performed sequentially in which subordinate leaders review assigned tasks and planned actions from start to finish of the operation. When time is available, backbriefs can be combined with other types of rehearsals to allow subordinate leaders to coordinate plans before performing more elaborate drills. Backbriefs require the fewest resources and may be the only option under time-constrained conditions. Note. The backbrief must not be confused with a confirmation brief. A confirmation brief is an opportunity for subordinate leaders to verify receipt and understanding of the commander’s intent and specified tasks, immediately following the issuance of the order. COMBINED ARMS REHEARSAL C-9. A combined arms rehearsal is a scripted event involving the commander, staff, and units used to identify and solve problems. A combined arms rehearsal enables the commander, staff, and subordinate units to synchronize plans, actions, and responsibilities across warfighting functions. Higher headquarters should execute a combined arms rehearsal after subordinate units not only issue their operation orders but also have an opportunity to rehearse their individual plans. This type of rehearsal helps ensure subordinate commanders’ plans achieve the higher echelon commander’s intent. C-10. A combined arms rehearsal is intended to be an opportunity to synchronize actions, identify conflicts, and solve problems through the fragmentary order process. It should not be a rigidly scripted event and should have time allocated for discussion. A combined arms rehearsal may be the final opportunity for problem identification and conflict resolution prior to execution, as the entire staff and unit is exposed to the overall scheme of events. SUPPORT REHEARSAL C-11. A support rehearsal is an event focused on synchronizing each warfighting function with the overall operation. Throughout preparation, units conduct support rehearsals within the framework of a single or limited number of warfighting functions that can involve coordination and procedure drills for aviation, fires, engineer support, or casualty evacuation. Support rehearsals and combined arms rehearsals complement preparations for an operation. Units may conduct support rehearsals separately and then combine them into full-dress rehearsals. Although these rehearsals differ slightly by warfighting function, they achieve the same result. BATTLE DRILL OR STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE REHEARSAL C-12. A battle drill is an action units collectively and rapidly execute without applying a deliberate decision- making process. A battle drill or SOP rehearsal ensures that all participants understand a technique or a specific set of procedures. Throughout preparation, units and staffs rehearse battle drills and SOPs. These rehearsals do not need a completed order from higher headquarters. Leaders place priority on those drills or actions they anticipate occurring during the operation. For example, a transportation platoon may rehearse a battle drill on reacting to an ambush while waiting to begin movement. (See Appendix E for details on command post battle drills.) C-13. All echelons use these rehearsal types; however, they are most common for platoons, squads, and sections. They are conducted throughout preparation, and they are not limited to published battle drills. All echelons can rehearse actions such as a command post shift change, an obstacle breach lane-marking SOP, or a refuel-on-the-move site operation. Rehearsals 0D\ FM 6-0 C-3 REHEARSAL TECHNIQUES C-14. Techniques for conducting rehearsals are limited only by the commander’s imagination and available resources. Several techniques are illustrated in figure C-1. Resources required for each technique range from narrow to broad. As listed from left to right, each successive technique takes more time and more resources. Each rehearsal technique also imparts a different level of understanding to participants. Considerations for determining the appropriate rehearsal technique include— z Time—the amount of time required to conduct (plan, prepare, execute, and assess) the rehearsal and make changes to the plan if gaps are identified. z Echelons involved—the number of echelons that can participate in the rehearsal. z Operations security (OPSEC) risks—unprotected friendly critical information observed by the enemy that can be exploited to affect the operation. z Terrain—the amount of area needed for the rehearsal. Figure C-1. Rehearsal techniques NETWORK REHEARSAL C-15. Units conduct network rehearsals over wide-area networks (known as WANs) or local area networks (known as LANs). Communications supporting the rehearsal may also involve radios. Commanders and staffs practice network rehearsals by talking through critical portions of the operation over communications networks in a sequence the commander establishes. The organization rehearses only the critical parts of the operation. These rehearsals require all information systems needed to execute that portion of the operation. Participants require working information systems, the OPORD, and graphics. Command posts can rehearse battle tracking during network rehearsals. C-16. If units provide clear SOPs, this technique can efficiently use time. However, if an organization has unclear SOPs, has units operating off the network, or has units without working communications, this technique can be time-consuming. Staffs consider and determine how to best mitigate these challenges, especially while participating in multinational operations. Unified action partners may not have access to the same networks, and organizations must determine how they can timely and effectively communicate. C-17. This technique lends itself to multiechelon rehearsals. If a unit executes a network rehearsal from current unit locations, the OPSEC risk may increase. The enemy may monitor the increased volume of transmissions and potentially compromise information. To avoid such compromise, organizations use Appendix C C-4 FM 6-0 0D\ different frequencies from those planned for the operation. Using wire systems is an option, but this does not exercise the network systems, which is the strong point of this technique. C-18. If a network rehearsal is executed from unit locations, terrain considerations are minimal. If a separate rehearsal area is required, considerations are similar to those of a reduced-force rehearsal. MAP REHEARSAL C-19. A map rehearsal is similar to a sketch-map rehearsal except the commander uses a map and operation overlay of the same scale used to plan the operation. Normally, it is the easiest technique to set up since it requires only maps and graphics for current operations. Units tailor a map rehearsal’s operation overlay to the echelon conducting the rehearsal. C-20. This technique requires the least terrain of all rehearsals. A good site ensures participants can easily find it yet stay concealed from the enemy. An optimal location overlooks the terrain where the unit will execute the operation. SKETCH-MAP REHEARSAL C-21. Commanders can use the sketch-map rehearsal technique almost anywhere, day or night. The procedures are the same as a terrain-model rehearsal, except the commander uses a sketch map in place of a terrain model. Large sketch maps ensure all participants can see the sketch map as each participant walks through execution of the operation. Participants move markers on the sketch map to represent unit locations and maneuvers. C-22. Sketch-map rehearsals take less time than terrain-model rehearsals and more time than map rehearsals. Units tailor a sketch map to the echelon conducting the rehearsal. Multiechelon rehearsals using this technique are difficult. C-23. This rehearsal can present OPSEC concerns if the area around the rehearsal site is not secured. Numerous movements, assembled commanders, and an increased number of vehicles in proximity can draw enemy attention. Units must sanitize, secure, or destroy the sketch map after use. C-24. This technique requires less terrain than a terrain-model rehearsal. A good site ensures participants can easily find it yet stay concealed from the enemy. An optimal location overlooks the terrain where the unit will execute the operation. DIGITAL TERRAIN-MODEL REHEARSAL C-25. Digital terrain models virtually represent an area of operations. Units drape high-resolution imagery over elevation data to create a fly-through or walk-through representation of the area of operations. Holographic imagery creates a three-dimensional view of the area. Often, a model links graphics, detailed information, unmanned aircraft systems, and ground imagery to key points to provide more insight into the plan. The unit geospatial engineers or imagery analysts can assist in digital model creation. The time required to create a digital three-dimensional model depends on the amount of available data on the terrain being modeled. For example, detailed models already exist for many cities and may only require updating. C-26. A digital terrain-model rehearsal best suits smaller echelons, although all echelons may be provided copies of the digital model to take back to their headquarters for a more detailed examination. If not placed on a computer network, there is significantly reduced OPSEC risk because this rehearsal type does not use a large physical site that requires securing, and leaders can conduct the rehearsal under cover. However, if placed on a computer network, digital terrain models can be subject to enemy collection and exploitation due to the inherent vulnerabilities of networks. TERRAIN-MODEL REHEARSAL C-27. The terrain-model rehearsal takes less time and fewer resources than a full-dress or reduced-force rehearsal. An accurately constructed terrain model helps subordinate leaders visualize the commander’s intent and concept of operations. When possible, commanders place the terrain model where it overlooks the actual terrain on the area of operations. The model’s orientation coincides with that of the terrain. The size Rehearsals 0D\ FM 6-0 C-5 of the terrain model can vary from small (using markers to represent units) to large (on which the participants can walk). A large model helps reinforce the participants’ perception of unit positions on the terrain. C-28. Often, constructing a terrain model consumes the most time during this technique. Units require a clear SOP that states how to build a model so it is accurate, large, and detailed enough to conduct the rehearsal. A good SOP also establishes staff responsibility for building the terrain model and a timeline for its completion. Because a terrain model is geared to the echelon conducting the rehearsal, multiechelon rehearsals using this technique are difficult. C-29. This rehearsal may risk OPSEC compromises if the area around the rehearsal site is not secured. Assembled commanders and their vehicles can draw enemy attention. Units must sanitize the terrain model after completing the rehearsal. Good rehearsal sites have areas for training aids and references, have parking areas with cover and concealment, and can be easily secured and defended. C-30. Terrain management is less difficult with a terrain-model rehearsal than with the previous rehearsal types.A good site is easy for participants to find, yet it is concealed from the enemy. An optimal location overlooks the terrain where the unit will execute the operation. KEY-LEADER REHEARSAL C-31. Circumstances may prohibit a rehearsal with all members of the unit. A key-leader rehearsal involves only select individuals of the organization and its subordinate units. It normally takes fewer resources than a full-dress rehearsal, and it may require developing a rehearsal plan that mirrors the actual plan but fits the terrain of the rehearsal. Commanders can use this technique to rehearse fire control measures for an engagement area during defensive operations, and they often use this technique to prepare key leaders for a full-dress rehearsal. C-32. A key-leader rehearsal normally requires less time than a full-dress rehearsal. Commanders consider how much time their subordinates need to plan and prepare when deciding whether to conduct a reduced force rehearsal. Smaller, subordinate units from the echelons involved can perform a full-dress rehearsal as part of a larger organization’s key-leader rehearsal. A key-leader rehearsal is less likely to present OPSEC compromises than a full-dress rehearsal because it has fewer participants and movements. FULL-DRESS REHEARSAL C-33. A full-dress rehearsal produces the most detailed understanding of an operation. It includes every participating Soldier and system. Leaders conduct the rehearsal on terrain similar to the area of operations, initially under good light conditions, and then in limited visibility. Leaders repeat small-unit actions until units execute them to standard. A full-dress rehearsal helps Soldiers clearly understand what commanders expect of them. It helps them gain confidence in their ability to accomplish the mission. Supporting elements, such as aviation crews, meet and rehearse with Soldiers to synchronize the operation. C-34. The higher echelon headquarters should also conduct, participate in, and support full-dress rehearsals with all echelons involved in the operation. The full-dress rehearsal is more difficult to accomplish at higher echelons, so commanders may develop an alternate rehearsal plan that mirrors the actual plan but fits the terrain available for the rehearsal. Terrain management for a full-dress rehearsal is challenging. Units must identify, secure, clear, and maintain the rehearsal area. All echelons involved in the operation participate in the full-dress rehearsal in some manner. C-35. Full-dress rehearsals consume more time than any other rehearsal type. For companies and smaller units, full-dress rehearsals most effectively ensure all units in the operation understand their roles. However, brigade and task force commanders consider how much time their subordinates need to plan and prepare when deciding whether to conduct a full-dress rehearsal or not. C-36. Moving a large part of the force may prompt an OPSEC compromise by attracting unwanted enemy attention. Commanders can protect a rehearsal from enemy information collection by developing an alternate plan, including graphics and radio frequencies that rehearses selected actions without compromising the actual OPORD. Commanders must ensure that they do not confuse subordinates when taking this action. Depending on the enemy’s collection capabilities, commanders may conduct deception in support of OPSEC. For example, units can create a diversion during rehearsals or stage alternate rehearsals in order to confuse Appendix C C-6 FM 6-0 0D\ the enemy and redirect collection efforts, therefore protecting critical information about the friendly operation. REHEARSAL RESPONSIBILITIES C-37. Paragraphs C-38 through C-55 address responsibilities for conducting rehearsals based on the combined arms rehearsal. Responsibilities are similar for other types of rehearsals. REHEARSAL PLANNING C-38. Commanders and chiefs of staff (executive officers at lower echelons) plan rehearsals. Paragraphs C- 39 and C-40 discuss their roles for rehearsal planning. Commander Rehearsal Planning Role C-39. As part of the commander’s guidance during mission analysis, commanders may provide rehearsal information and guidance. When they select a course of action, they may revise the— z Rehearsal type. z Rehearsal technique. z Location. z Attendees. z Enemy course of action to be portrayed. Chief of Staff or Executive Officer Rehearsal Planning Role C-40. The chief of staff (COS) or executive officer (XO) ensures all rehearsals are included in the organization’s time-management SOP and planning timeline. The COS’s or XO’s responsibilities include— z Publishing the rehearsal time and location in the OPORD or warning order. z Conducting staff rehearsals. z Determining rehearsal products based on type, technique, and mission variables. z Coordinating liaison officer attendance from adjacent units. REHEARSAL PREPARATION C-41. Everyone involved in executing or supporting the rehearsal has responsibilities during preparation. Paragraphs C-42 through C-45 describe rehearsal preparation responsibilities. Commander Rehearsal Preparation Responsibilities C-42. Commanders prepare to rehearse operations with events phased in order from start to finish. Under time-constrained conditions, this often proves difficult. Commanders— z Identify and prioritize key events to rehearse. z Allocate time for each event. z Perform personal preparation, including reviews of—  Task organization completeness.  Personnel and materiel readiness.  Organizational level of preparation. Chief of Staff or Executive Officer Rehearsal Preparation Responsibilities C-43. The COS or XO coordinates and war-games with the commander. This enables the COS or XO to— z Prepare to lead and manage the execution of the rehearsal. z Coordinate times for key events requiring rehearsal. z Establish rehearsal time limits per the commander’s guidance and mission variables. Rehearsals 0D\ FM 6-0 C-7 z Verify rehearsal site preparation. A separate rehearsal site may be required for some events, such as a possible obstacle site. A good rehearsal site includes—  Appropriate markings and associated training aids.  Parking areas.  Security. z Determine the method for controlling the rehearsal and ensuring its logical flow, such as a script. Subordinate Leaders Rehearsal Preparation Responsibilities C-44. Subordinate leaders complete their planning. This planning includes— z Completing unit OPORDs. z Identifying issues derived from the higher echelon headquarters’ OPORD. z Providing a copy of their unit OPORD with graphics to the higher echelon headquarters. z Performing personal preparation similar to that of the commander. z Ensuring they and their subordinates bring all necessary equipment. z Including OPSEC during rehearsal planning. Conducting Headquarters Staff Rehearsal Preparation Responsibilities C-45. Conducting headquarters staff members have several staff rehearsal responsibilities. They— z Develop an OPORD with necessary overlays. z Deconflict all subordinate unit graphics. Composite overlays are the first step for leaders to visualize the organization’s overall plan. z Publish combined overlays at the rehearsal, including, at a minimum—  Movement and maneuver.  Intelligence.  Fires.  Sustainment.  Signal operations.  Protection. REHEARSAL EXECUTION C-46. During the rehearsal execution, the commander, COS or XO, staff assistants, subordinate leaders, recorder, and staff from the conducting headquarters have specific responsibilities. These responsibilities are discussed in paragraphs C-47 through C-53. Commander Rehearsal Execution Responsibilities C-47. Commanders command the rehearsal just as they will command the operation. They maintain the focus and level of intensity, limiting the potential for subordinate confusion. Although the staff refines the OPORD, it belongs to the commander. The commander uses the order to conduct operations. An effective rehearsal is not a commander’s briefing to subordinates. It validates synchronization—the what, when, and where—of tasks that subordinate units will perform to execute the operation and achieve the commander’s intent. Chief of Staff or Executive Officer Rehearsal Execution Responsibilities C-48. Normally, the COS or XO serves as the rehearsal director. This officer ensures each unit will accomplish its tasks at the right time and cues the commander to upcoming decisions. The COS’s or XO’s script is the execution matrix (a visual representation of subordinate tasks) and the decision support template (a graphic depicting information required to execute a specific friendly course of action). The COS or XO as the rehearsal director validates the task organization. This validation includes checking that linkups are complete or on schedule, and required materiel and personnel are on hand. The importance of this simple check cannot be overemphasized. Additionally, the COS or XO as the rehearsal director— Appendix C C-8 FM 6-0 0D\ z Starts the rehearsal on time. z Conducts a formal roll call. z Ensures everyone brings the necessary equipment, including organizational graphics and previously issued orders. z Ensures synchronization of the operational framework being used—deep-close-security, decisive shaping-sustaining, or main and supporting efforts. z Rehearses the synchronization of combat power from adjacent and higher organizations. These organizations often exceed the communications range of the commander and G-3 or S-3 when they are away from the command post. z Synchronizes the timing and contribution of each warfighting function. z For each decisive point, defines conditions required to—  Commit the reserve or striking forces.  Move a unit.  Close or emplace an obstacle.  Fire at planned targets.  Move a medical unit, change a supply route, and alert specific observation posts. z Disciplines leader movements, enforces brevity, and ensures completeness. z Keeps within time constraints. z Ensures that the most important events receive the most attention. z Ensures that absentees and flank units receive changes to the OPORD and transmits changes to them as soon as practical. z Communicates the key civil considerations of the operation. Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3 or S-3 Rehearsal Execution Responsibilities C-49. The assistant COS, G-3 or S-3 assists the commander with the rehearsal. The G-3 or S-3— z Portrays the friendly scheme of maneuver. z Ensures subordinate unit actions comply with the commander’s intent. z Normally provides the recorder. Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 or S-2 Rehearsal Execution Responsibilities C-50. The assistant COS, G-2 or S-2 portrays the enemy forces and other variables of an operational environment (known as OE) during rehearsals. The G-2 or S-2 bases actions on the enemy course of action that the commander selected during the military decision-making process (known as MDMP). The G-2 or S- 2— z Provides participants with current intelligence. z Portrays the best possible assessment of the enemy course of action. z Communicates the enemy’s presumed concept of operations, desired effects, and end state. z Explains other factors of an operational environment that may hinder or complicate friendly actions. z Communicates the key civil considerations of the operation. Subordinate Leaders Rehearsal Execution Responsibilities C-51. Subordinate unit leaders, using an established format, effectively articulate their units’ actions and responsibilities. They also record changes on their copies of the graphics or OPORD. Recorder Rehearsal Execution Responsibilities C-52. The recorder is normally a representative from the G-3 or S-3 staff. During the rehearsal, the recorder captures all coordination made during execution and notes unresolved problems. At the end of the rehearsal, the recorder— Rehearsals 0D\ FM 6-0 C-9 z Presents any unresolved problems to the commander for resolution. z Restates any changes, coordination, or clarifications directed by the commander. z Estimates when a written fragmentary order codifying the changes will follow. Designated Staff Rehearsal Execution Responsibilities C-53. The staff updates the OPORD, decision support template, and execution matrix. The staff updates these items based on the decisions of the commander. REHEARSAL ASSESSMENT C-54. The commander establishes the standard for a successful rehearsal. A properly executed rehearsal validates each leader’s role and how each unit contributes to the overall operation. This validation includes what each unit does, when each unit does it relative to times and events, and where each unit does it to achieve desired effects. An effective rehearsal ensures commanders have a common vision of enemy forces, their own forces, the terrain, and the relationships among them. It identifies specific actions requiring immediate staff resolution and informs the higher echelon commander of critical issues or locations that the commander, COS or XO, or G-3 or S-3 must personally oversee. C-55. The commander (or rehearsal director in the commander’s absence) assesses and critiques all parts of the rehearsal. These critiques center on how well the operation achieves the commander’s intent and on the coordination necessary to accomplish that end. Usually, commanders leave the internal execution of tasks within the rehearsal to the subordinate unit commander’s judgment and discretion. CONDUCTING THE REHEARSAL C-56. All participants have responsibilities before, during, and after a rehearsal. Before a rehearsal, the rehearsal director states the commander’s expectations and orients the other participants on details of the rehearsal, as necessary. During a rehearsal, all participants rehearse their roles in the operation. They make sure they understand how their actions support the overall operation and note any additional coordination required. After a rehearsal, participants ensure that they understand any changes to the OPORD and coordination requirements and that they received all updated staff products. C-57. Commanders do not normally address small problems that arise during rehearsals. Instead, the G-3 or S-3 recorder keeps a record of these problems. This ensures the commander does not interrupt the rehearsal’s flow. If the problem remains at the end of the rehearsal, the commander solves it then. If the problem jeopardizes mission accomplishment, the staff accomplishes the coordination necessary to solve it before the participants disperse. Identifying and solving such problems is a major reason for conducting rehearsals. If commanders do not make corrections while participants are assembled, they may lose the opportunity to do so. Coordinating among dispersed participants and disseminating changes to them often proves more difficult than accomplishing these actions in person. BEFORE THE REHEARSAL C-58. Before the rehearsal, the staff completes the OPORD with overlays and conducts three events: z Introduction and overview. z Orientation. z Rehearsal script. Introduction and Overview C-59. The rehearsal director (normally the COS or XO) calls the roll and briefs participants on information needed for execution. The briefing begins with an introduction, overview, and orientation. It includes a discussion of the rehearsal script and ground rules. The detail of this discussion is based on participants’ familiarity with the rehearsal SOP. C-60. Next, the rehearsal director gives an overview of the briefing topics, rehearsal subjects, sequence, and timeline, specifying the no-later-than ending time. The rehearsal director explains after action reviews, Appendix C C-10 FM 6-0 0D\ describes how and when they occur, and discusses how to incorporate changes into the OPORD. The director explains any constraints, such as pyrotechnics use, light discipline, weapons firing, or radio silence. For safety, the rehearsal director ensures all participants understand hazard controls and enforces their use. Last, the director emphasizes results and states the commander’s standard for a successful rehearsal. Subordinate leaders state any results of planning or preparation (including rehearsals) they have already conducted.If a subordinate recommends a change to the OPORD, the rehearsal director acts on the recommendation before the rehearsal begins, if possible. If not, the commander resolves the recommendation with a decision typically before the rehearsal ends. Orientation C-61. The rehearsal director orients the participants to the terrain or rehearsal medium. The rehearsal director identifies orientation using magnetic north on the rehearsal medium and symbols representing actual terrain features. After explaining any graphic control measures, obstacles, and targets, the rehearsal director issues supplemental materials, if needed. Rehearsal Script C-62. An effective means for the rehearsal director to control rehearsals is the use of a script. It keeps the rehearsal on track. The script provides a checklist so the organization addresses all warfighting functions and outstanding issues. It has two major parts, the agenda and response sequence. Agenda C-63. An effective rehearsal follows a prescribed agenda that everyone knows and understands. This agenda includes, but is not limited to— z Roll call. z Participant orientation to the terrain. z Location of civilians likely to impact operations. z Enemy situation brief. z Friendly situation brief. z Description of expected enemy actions. z Discussion of friendly unit actions. z A review of notes made by the recorder. C-64. The execution matrix, decision support template, and OPORD outline the rehearsal agenda. These tools, especially the execution matrix, both drive and focus the rehearsal. The commander and staff use them to control the operation’s execution. Any templates, matrixes, or tools developed within each of the warfighting functions should tie directly to the supported unit’s execution matrix and decision support template. Examples include an intelligence synchronization matrix or fires execution matrix. C-65. An effective rehearsal realistically and quickly portrays the enemy force and other variables of an operational environment without distracting from the rehearsal. One technique for doing this has the G-2 or S-2 preparing an actions checklist. It lists a sequence of events much like the one for friendly units but from the enemy or civilian perspective. Response Sequence C-66. Participants respond in a logical sequence—either by warfighting function or by unit—as the organization deploys, from front to rear. The commander determines the sequence before the rehearsal. The staff posts the sequence at the rehearsal site, and the rehearsal director may restate it. C-67. Effective rehearsals allow participants to visualize and synchronize the concept of operations. As the rehearsal proceeds, participants talk through the concept of operations. They focus on key events and the synchronization required to achieve the desired effects. The commander leads the rehearsal and gives orders during the operation. Subordinate commanders enter and leave the discussion at the time they expect to begin and end their tasks or activities during the operation. This practice helps the commander assess the Rehearsals 0D\ FM 6-0 C-11 synchronization. Commanders do not “re-war-game” unless absolutely necessary to ensure subordinate unit commanders understand the plan. C-68. The rehearsal director emphasizes integrating fires, events that trigger different branch actions, and actions on contact. The chief of fires, deputy fire support coordinator, fire support officer, or firing unit commander states when to initiate fires, who to fire them, from where the firing comes, the ammunition available, and the desired target effect. Subordinate commanders state when they initiate fires per their fire support plans. The rehearsal director speaks for any absent staff section and ensures the rehearsal addresses all actions on the synchronization matrix and decision support template at the proper time or event. C-69. The rehearsal director ensures that the rehearsal includes key sustainment and protection actions at the appropriate times. Failure to do so reduces the value of the rehearsal as a coordination tool. The staff officer with coordinating staff responsibility inserts these items into the rehearsal. Special staff officers should brief by exception when a friendly or enemy event occurs within their areas of expertise. Summarizing these actions at the end of the rehearsal can reinforce coordination requirements identified during the rehearsal. The staff updates the decision support template and gives a copy to each participant. Under time-constrained conditions, the conducting headquarters staff may provide copies before the rehearsal and rely on participants to update them with pen-and-ink changes. (See table C-1 for sample sustainment and protection actions.) Table C-1. Example sustainment and protection actions for rehearsals x Confirm casualty evacuation routes. x Confirm ambulance exchange point locations. x Confirm refuel-on-the-move points. x Confirm Class IV and Class V resupply points. x Confirm logistics release points. x Confirm support area displacement times and locations. x Confirm detainee collection points. x Confirm aviation support. x Confirm military police actions. Ground Rules C-70. The rehearsal director establishes the ground rules for the rehearsal. After discussing the rehearsal script, the rehearsal director— z States the standard (what the commander requires) for a successful rehearsal. z Ensures everyone understands the parts of the OPORD to rehearse. If the unit will not rehearse the entire operation, the rehearsal director states the events to be rehearsed. z Quickly reviews the rehearsal SOP if all participants are not familiar with it. An effective rehearsal SOP states—  Who controls the rehearsal.  Who approves the rehearsal venue and its construction.  When special staff officers brief the commander.  The relationship between how the execution matrix portrays events and how units rehearse events. z Establishes the timeline that designates the rehearsal starting time in relation to H-hour. For example, begins the rehearsal by depicting the anticipated situation one hour before H-hour. One event executed before rehearsing the first event is deployment of forces. z Establishes the time interval to begin and track the rehearsal. For example, the rehearsal director may specify that a ten-minute interval equates to one hour of actual time. z Updates friendly and enemy activities as necessary. For example, the rehearsal director describes any ongoing reconnaissance. The rehearsal director concludes the orientation with a call for questions. DURING THE REHEARSAL C-71. Once the rehearsal director finishes discussing the ground rules and answering questions, the G-3 or S-3 reads the mission statement, the commander reads the commander’s intent, and the G-3 or S-3 establishes the current friendly situation. The rehearsal then begins, following the rehearsal script. Appendix C C-12 FM 6-0 0D\ C-72. Paragraphs C-73 through C-85 outline a generic set of rehearsal steps developed for combined arms rehearsals. However, with a few modifications, these steps support any rehearsal technique. The products depend on the rehearsal type. Step 1-Deploy Enemy Forces C-73. The G-2 or S-2 briefs on the current enemy situation and operational environment. The G-2 or S-2 places markers on the map or terrain board (as applicable) indicating where enemy forces and other operationally significant groups or activities would be before the first rehearsal event. The G-2 or S-2 then briefs the most likely enemy course of action and operational context. The G-2 or S-2 also briefs the status of information collection operations (for example, citing any patrols still out or any observation post positions). Step 2-Deploy Friendly Forces C-74. The G-3 or S-3 briefs friendly maneuver unit dispositions, including security forces, as they are arrayed at the start of the operation. Subordinate commanders and other staff officers brief their unit positions and any particular points of emphasis at the starting time. For example, the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (known as CBRN) officer states the mission-oriented protective posture level, and the chief of fires, deputy fire support coordinator, fire support officer, or fires unit commander states the range of friendly and enemy artillery. Other participants place markers for friendly forces, including adjacent units, at the positions they will occupy at the start of the operation. As participants place markers, they state their task and purpose, task organization, and strength. C-75. Sustainment and protection units brief positions, plans, and actions at the starting time and at points of emphasis the rehearsal director designates. Subordinate units may include forward arming and refueling points, refuel-on-the-move points, communications checkpoints, security points, or OPSEC procedures that differ for any period during the operation. The rehearsal director restates the commander’s intent, if necessary. Step 3-Initiate Action C-76. The rehearsal director states the first event on the execution matrix. Normally this involves the G-2 or S-2 moving enemy markers according to the most likely course of action. The depiction must tie enemy actions to specific terrain or to friendly unit actions. The G-2 or S-2 portrays enemy actions based on the situation template developed for staff war gaming. C-77. As the rehearsal proceeds, the G-2 or S-2 portrays the enemy and other operational factors and walks through the most likely enemy course of action (per the situation template). The G-2 or S-2 stresses reconnaissance routes, objectives, security force composition and locations, initial contact, initial fires (including artillery, air, and attack helicopters), probable main force objectives or engagement areas, and likely commitment of reserve forces. Step 4-Reach Decision Points C-78. When the rehearsal director determines that a particular enemy movement or reaction is complete, the commander assesses the situation to determine if a decision point has been reached. Decision points are taken directly from the decision support template. C-79. If the commander determines the unit is not at a decision point and not at the end state, the commander directs the rehearsal director to continue to the next event on the execution matrix. Participants use the response sequence and continue to act out and describe their units’ actions. C-80. When the rehearsal reaches conditions that establish a decision point, the commander decides whether to continue with the current course of action or select a branching course of action. If electing the current course of action, the commander directs the rehearsal director to move to the next event in the execution matrix. If selecting a branch, the commander states the reason for selecting that branch, states the first event of that branch, and continues the rehearsal until the organization has rehearsed all events of that branch. As the unit reaches decisive points, the rehearsal director states the conditions required for success. Rehearsals 0D\ FM 6-0 C-13 C-81. When it becomes obvious that the operation requires additional coordination to ensure success, participants immediately begin coordinating. This is one of the key reasons for rehearsals. The rehearsal director ensures that the recorder captures the coordination and any changes and ensures that all participants understand the coordination. Step 5-Achieve End State C-82. Achieving the desired end state completes that phase of the rehearsal. In an attack, this will usually be when the unit is on the objective and has finished consolidation and casualty evacuation. In the defense, this will usually be after the decisive action (such as committing the reserve or striking force), the final destruction or withdrawal of the enemy, and casualty evacuation is complete. In stability tasks, this usually occurs when a unit achieves the targeted progress within a designated line of effort. Step 6-Reset C-83. At this point, the commander states the next branch to rehearse. The rehearsal director resets the situation to the decision point where that branch begins and states the criteria for a decision to execute that branch. Participants assume those criteria have been met and then conduct the operation along that branch until they attain the desired end state. They complete any coordination needed to ensure all participants understand and can meet any requirements. The recorder records any changes to the branch. C-84. The commander then states the next branch to rehearse. The rehearsal director again resets the situation to the decision point where that branch begins, and participants repeat the process. This continues until the rehearsal has addressed all decision points and branches that the commander wants to rehearse. C-85. If the standard is not met and time permits, the commander directs participants to repeat the rehearsal. The rehearsal continues until participants are prepared or until the time available expires. Commanders may allocate more time for a rehearsal, but they must assess the effects on subordinate commanders’ preparation time. Successive rehearsals, if conducted, should be more complex and realistic. At the end of the rehearsal, the recorder restates any changes, coordination, or clarifications that the commander directed and estimates how long it will take to codify changes in a written fragmentary order. AFTER THE REHEARSAL C-86. After the rehearsal, the commander leads an after action review. The commander reviews lessons learned and makes the minimum required modifications to the existing plan. (Normally, a fragmentary order affects these changes.) Changes should be refinements to the OPORD; they should not be radical or significant. Changes not critical to the operation’s execution may confuse subordinates and hinder the synchronization of the plan. The commander issues any last minute instructions or reminders and reiterates the commander’s intent. C-87. Based on the commander’s instructions, the staff makes any necessary changes to the OPORD, decision support template, and execution matrix based on the rehearsal results. Subordinate commanders incorporate these changes into their units’ OPORDs. The COS or XO ensures the changes are briefed to all leaders or liaison officers who did not participate in the rehearsal. C-88. The rehearsal provides the final opportunity for subordinates to identify and fix unsolved problems. The staff ensures that all participants understand any changes to the OPORD and the recorder captures all coordination done at the rehearsal. All changes to the published OPORD are, in effect, verbal fragmentary orders. As soon as possible, the staff publishes each verbal fragmentary order as a written fragmentary order that changes the published OPORD. CONCLUSION C-89. Army units must rehearse expected actions to improve performance during execution. All personnel involved must understand their own roles and the roles of those around them to sufficiently prepare for operations. Furthermore, if the situation requires, they must be able to assume the role of their supervisor or other leaders in the chain of command. It is therefore imperative that all personnel involved understand the mission, commander’s intent, scheme of operations, and desired end state.

This appendix discusses foreign disclosure policy. It differentiates between the classifications of military information available for sharing and the ways disclosure is determined. Lastly, it discusses the role of foreign disclosure personnel and their education and training. FOREIGN DISCLOSURE POLICY D-1. The ability to share, synchronize, and integrate military information is integral to achieve shared understanding in multinational operations. The United States maintains provisions for sharing classified and controlled military information with allies and partners. D-2. Laws, regulations, and directives govern the sharing of classified or controlled information. These include, but are not limited to— z AR 380-10.
z DODM 5200.01 volume 3.
z DODD 5230.11.
z Executive Order 13526.
z National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1). z Public Law 80-253, National Security Act of 1947, as amended. z Public Law 104-201, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997.
z Title 10 United States Code. z Exceptions to National Disclosure Policy (known as ENDPs), also referred to as records of action. CATEGORIZATION OF MILITARY INFORMATION D-3. Military information falls into two categorizations, classified military information or unclassified information. The difference in the two corresponds to the level of protection that must be afforded the information, due to the sensitivity of the information, and the information’s relationship to national security. For example, information that is commonly known and found in the public domain is the least protected information. Information that would directly compromise the security of the nation is the most protected.CLASSIFIED MILITARY INFORMATION D-4. Classified military information (CMI) is information that a competent authority has determined to be of such sensitivity that it requires special designation and protection in the interest of national security. CMI is subject to special controls. Access to CMI is limited to personnel whose duty clearly requires such access (need-to-know) and who have been cleared for such access. According to its degree of sensitivity, CMI is identified by levels of security classification: “CONFIDENTIAL,” “SECRET,” or “TOP SECRET.” (See DODM 5200.01, Volume 2 and AR 380-5 for details regarding the classification of defense information.) UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION D-5. Unclassified information is information a competent authority has determined does not require the degree of protection afforded by the application of a security classification. Unclassified information is Appendix D D-2 FM 6-0 0D\ divided into either controlled unclassified information (CUI) or public domain. (See DODM 5200.01, Volume 2 and AR 380-5 for more information on CUI.) Controlled Unclassified Information D-6. CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification in accordance with Executive Order 13526. However, this information is pertinent to the national interests of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government. Under law or policy, this information requires safeguarding or dissemination controls, pursuant to and consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Government-wide policies. (See DODM 5200.01, Volume 2 for detailed information concerning CUI.) Public Domain D-7. Public domain is unclassified information that does not qualify for the status of CUI and is deemed to be actually or potentially in the public domain (in other words, suitable for disclosure to the public at large). The proponent for the disclosure of Army public domain information is the Army Public Affairs Office. Note. Simply because official information appears on unofficial, nongovernmental websites does not mean it is approved for disclosure. Information posted on approved Department of Defense or other U.S. government websites accessible on the public domain that do not require additional means of access—such as use of the common access card or login and password or display marked restrictions—may be considered cleared for public release. DISCLOSURE DETERMINATION D-8. Because all disclosure determinations involving military information, whether CMI or unclassified information, is adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, U.S. military personnel must remain noncommittal when receiving requests. They avoid creating the impression that such information will be made readily available to foreign partners. Additional restrictions typically apply for information concerning military materiel, technology, or information, including intelligence threat data or countermeasures information. D-9. U.S. participation in bilateral or multilateral agreements does not automatically authorize the disclosure of controlled information to foreign participants. An international agreement does not necessarily preclude disclosure. Foreign disclosure personnel evaluate each potential disclosure on its own merit. Designated authorities following approved criteria approve or deny disclosure requests. (See AR 380-10 for authorities, responsibilities, and policies regarding foreign disclosure and contact with foreign representatives.) D-10. NDP-1 contains the national policy, procedures, criteria, and limitations; definitions of terms; release arrangements; and other guidance required by U.S. departments and agencies. These departments and agencies have a need to release classified U.S. military information to foreign governments and international organizations. It is essential the commander and staff know and understand that NDP-1 is based upon a combination of temporary and standing disclosure authorities. Temporal authorities are normally established to support contingency operation and documented in exceptions to National Disclosure Policies or records of action. These are operation-specific guidance and can only be applied to the relevant named operation. This is opposed to security cooperation events and activities, where Army forces adhere to the standing authorities articulated in NDP-1. D-11. Staffs properly apply provisions of the NDP-1 to facilitate the timely disclosure and transfer of critical information and materiel to allied and partner countries. These provisions protect critical military technologies and materiel so U.S. forces can attain U.S. national security goals and objectives. Foreign disclosure authorization applies to the information that U.S. military forces want—and are authorized—to share with unified action partners. However, this authorization does not govern the systems or networks used to transfer approved information. AR 25-2 governs access to Army computer systems (stand-alone or network), including the Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (known as NIPRNET) and the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (known as SIPRNET). This access applies to foreign liaison officers, other Foreign Disclosure 0D\ FM 6-0 D-3 foreign officials certified and assigned to Army organizations, and official foreign government visitors. Staffs only disclose military information to these foreign government officials using Army computer systems in accordance with AR 380-10. Note. There are no restrictions on uncontrolled information, not owned by or in the possession of the Department of Defense, including unclassified information lacking designation. However, in the interest of operations security (OPSEC), all Department of the Army (DA) civilians, Servicemembers, and contractors consider that adversaries may gather uncontrolled unclassified information and gain an advantage by compiling and aggregating data. D-12. SECRET is the only heading for NPD-1. However, NDP-1 considers some categories of information more valuable to protect or leverage than other categories. Therefore, delegated disclosure authorities for a particular country may vary by category of military information. For example, the U.S. may only disclose SECRET information related to categories 1 through 4 to country x but not disclose SECRET information related to categories 5 through 8. D-13. National, Department of Defense, and Army disclosure policies only apply to and govern the content or information in question. In other words, disclosure policy is about what foreign partners “can know” and not how they access the information via a particular system or network. D-14. Because not all classified information is valued at the same level, NDP-1 divides CMI into eight categories. These categories are— z Category 1 (Organization, Training, and Employment of Military Forces). z Category 2 (Military Materiel and Munitions). z Category 3 (Applied Research and Development Information and Materiel). z Category 4 (Production Information). z Category 5 (Combined Military Operations, Planning, and Readiness). z Category 6 (U.S. Order of Battle). z Category 7 (North American Defense). z Category 8 (Military Intelligence). For the purposes of Army disclosure policy, these same definitions apply to CUI as well. (See AR 380-10 for further explanations on each category.) FOREIGN DISCLOSURE PERSONNEL D-15. A foreign disclosure officer (FDO) is a DA member—either a uniformed member or DA Civilian— appointed to oversee and control coordination and approval of specific disclosures of CMI and CUI. A foreign disclosure representative (FDR) is an individual designated in writing who assists and advises the FDO on all disclosure matters. FDRs may be DA members, but, unlike FDOs, they may also be Army-employed contractors. FDRs may be appointed at any echelon of command to provide foreign disclosure assistance and recommendations. FDRs do not make disclosure decisions. FDRs are required to successfully complete the Army’s Foreign Disclosure Officer Certification Course. D-16. All FDOs and FDRs are appointed in writing by the commander, and they maintain a copy of their appointment orders. FDOs require sufficient military or civilian rank to make disclosure decisions on behalf of their organization’s commander. All FDOs and FDRs must successfully complete the Army’s Foreign Disclosure Officer Certification Course or Foreign Disclosure Representative Certification Course, as applicable, and the Department of Defense’s International Programs Security Requirements Course within 30 days of appointment. D-17. Foreign disclosure is an inherently governmental function; therefore, contractors may not perform FDO duties. FDOs are authorized for appointment to the lowest command or agency level that is the proponent for Army-originated, Army-developed, or Army-derived CMI and that routinely discloses U.S.
CMI to foreign governments or international organizations in support of approved Army international programs or operational activities. FDOs oversee activities of all command, organization, and activity appointed FDRs. Appendix D D-4 FM 6-0 0D\ D-18. The number of FDOs and FDRs is based on the command’s assessment of how much disclosure its mission requires versus the amount of risk entailed with more FDOs and FDRs. Although not a requirement, the primary unit FDO is usually in the G-2 or S-2 section with alternate FDOs and FDRs throughout the rest of the staff, based on the mission-based need for disclosure. Unit FDOs support to their commanders and organizations by— z Informing and advising the commander and staff on the impact and implications of current delegated disclosure authorities by country, category of information, and classification level. z Advising the commander and staff on the recommended number and location of FDRs based on current and anticipated mission requirements. z Directing the organization’s information production requirements efforts (known as the joint’s write for release) for all categories of CMI and CUI to ensure adequate disclosure to unified action partners. z Coordinating for the authority and permission to disclose information originated outside the organization. z Developing and promulgating foreign disclosure guidance for deployments, exercises, training events, and official foreign visitors (including exchange officers and liaison officers). z Ensuring unit and organization complies with AR 380-10, guidance from higher echelon headquarters, and other applicable requirements. D-19. A contact officer is a DA member appointed to oversee and facilitate all contacts, requests for information, consultations, access, and other activities of foreign nationals assigned to a DA component or subordinate organization as extended visitors. All personnel designated as contact officers complete an Army Contact Officer Certification Course and provide proof of completion to their servicing FDO. The FDO maintains a copy of the contact officer’s appointment orders, training certificate, and pertinent administrative data. D-20. Foreign disclosure requirements and information and network security policies may require special communications and liaison arrangements to affect the physical transfer or disclosure of information in a timely manner. Foreign disclosure policy and rule sets only govern what the partner can know, not access to the networks or the physical locations in which the information may reside or is transmitted. FOREIGN DISCLOSURE TRAINING AND EDUCATION D-21. Commanders and those DA officials who have disclosure authority must establish foreign disclosure education programs for their organizations. These programs aim to have command personnel perform their foreign disclosure responsibilities well. These programs are tailored, as much as possible, to the involvement of individuals in the foreign disclosure program and the command’s mission. Ideally, the program— z Provides the necessary information and guidance to ensure the foreign disclosure effort is fully integrated into all facets of the command’s or organization’s roles, functions, and missions that involve foreign participation. z Ensures that all assigned personnel in the command or organization can consistently apply foreign disclosure policies and concepts relevant to the command’s or organization’s roles, functions, and missions that involve foreign participation. z Ensures that foreign disclosure actions and activities add value to the command’s or organization’s roles, functions, and missions, and the command and control (known as C2) warfighting function. z Ensures that foreign disclosure actions and activities remain balanced with respect to protecting critical technologies and information. D-22. All DA employees, especially those who play a role in the foreign disclosure program, receive refresher training in their responsibilities regarding foreign disclosure annually. The actual frequency and nature of continuing foreign disclosure education is determined by the needs of the command’s foreign disclosure program and the nature of the personnel involved in the program. At a minimum, all personnel receive annual refresher training that reinforces the policies, principles, and procedures covered in initial and specialized foreign disclosure training. Whenever foreign disclosure policies and procedures change, FDRs brief personnel whose duties are impacted by these changes as soon as possible. Foreign Disclosure 0D\ FM 6-0 D-5 FOREIGN DISCLOSURE STAFF PLANNING D-23. Whenever an exercise or mission potentially includes foreign disclosure, the FDO must be integrated into the staff and staff planning process. This integration is important since effective disclosure is key to successful combined operations. Foreign disclosure is a combination push and pull enterprise for information requirements and guidance. D-24. The FDO participates in the military decision-making process (known as MDMP) alongside other staff members identifying critical facts and assumptions. For each step in the military decision-making process, the FDO prepares to both process key inputs and produce key outputs with those of the commander and other staff members. The FDO must know and understand the commander’s intent with respect to foreign disclosure and information sharing. The FDO plans to communicate this guidance to the staff or organization as an annex, appendix, or tab to an operation plan or operation order when required. D-25. For the FDO, planning does not end with the production of an order or initial guidance. The FDO continually updates applicable data and information sets in preparation of subsequent efforts. Commanders have this same expectation for all other staff principals and special staff. D-26. Initial considerations regarding foreign disclosure may include— z Status of current extended visitors such as foreign liaison officers and the disclosure authorities and guidance associated with those positions. z Access to relevant system security classification guides. z Access to relevant records of actions detailing disclosure guidance and authorities resulting from exceptions to NDP-1. z Relevant and related delegation of disclosure authority letters. z Security cooperation goals and objectives related to the potential foreign audience or participants. z Outside organizations or agencies to contact to incorporate into the planning process. z Anticipated disclosure requirements and authorities by country, category, and classification levels. z Current disclosure requirements and authorities by country, category, and classification levels. z Current disclosure authorities that can be applied or leveraged. z Number and location of FDOs and FDRs. D-27. The FDO compiles critical facts and assumptions and disclosure-related resourcing issues that are likely to impact other staff sections. The FDO identifies potential requirements to support other staff sections throughout an operation. Even if the order from higher echelon headquarters has no specified tasks, there will likely be implied tasks. Implied tasks may include— z Plan for disclosures with foreign participants. z Plan for establishing disclosure guidance to support foreign participants and liaison personnel. z Plan for disclosures with other U.S. government and international organizations to support post- conflict stabilization and reconstruction efforts. z Plan to capture foreign disclosure-related issues that must be addressed now or in the future to improve combat readiness while operating in a multinational environment. z Maintain a record of lessons learned. z Review available assets and identify shortfalls in personnel, training, information systems, and other relevant areas. z Determine limitations and constraints. z Begin risk management based on the commander’s guidance and willingness to accept risk. D-28. The FDO begins to look at draft organizational structures and task organization and identifies requirements for FDOs, FDRs and contact officers (if required). The FDO begins looking at the status of and requirements for trained and certified disclosure personnel in the organization and anticipating requirements from other supporting FDOs. Disclosure authority is also an asset that the FDO needs to explore and understand. D-29. A constraint is a restriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an action or inaction, thus restricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander (FM 5-0). A constraint Appendix D D-6 FM 6-0 0D\ dictates action or inaction, thus restricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. For example, the FDO may find that there is only disclosure authority currently in place to facilitate disclosures of Category 1 and Category 2 information to desired participants. Based on the mission statement from the higher echelon commander, there is a compelling need to be able to disclose Category 5, Category 6, and Category 8 information as well. As such, current authorities have created a constraint that must be addressed and overcome in order to fulfill the mission requirements.At the other end of the spectrum, there may be no constraints on the type or level of information that may be disclosed. In doing this personal mission analysis, the FDO may find that constraints for information sharing come from existing and related security or network issues. While these latter two areas fall outside the purview of the foreign disclosure policy to resolve, all FDOs must be mindful of them and, more importantly, be able to communicate them as such (outside the purview of foreign disclosure policy) to their commander and staff peers. D-30. Contributing to the warning order and the subsequent operation order (known as OPORD), the FDO may include notifying subordinate FDOs of their pending requirements for personnel (including FDOs, FDRs, and contact officers), training and education, and any other related tasks or work functions for which they may be responsible. The FDO ensures that the synchronization matrix reflects when foreign forces, host nation, and outside activities and organizations incorporate their roles or actions into the course of action. Understanding and being able to visualize disclosure requirements in terms of time and space are critical for mission success. Equally important is being able to visualize the specific foreign disclosure requirements in this same manner. The FDO must clearly communicate this information to the commander and staff, since this step also involves developing the criteria that the staff will use for comparative analysis in the next step. D-31. While the overall production and marking of the order and annexes are not the responsibility of the FDO, the FDO ensures the staff understands the impact of improperly marked or coordinated products. Documents with excessively restrictive or inappropriate makings or caveats can delay or inhibit effective participation and support from foreign forces or outside organizations and agencies. Likewise, products not marked properly present an obvious risk for inadvertent disclosures. The FDO must know whether a document or product has to be marked or not. The FDO must communicate to the commander and staff any policy or guidance that relates to the marking or remarking of certain legacy documents or products. CONCLUSION D-32. Foreign disclosure is not solely an FDO responsibility. All personnel must be aware of and abide by policies, regulations, and laws which govern the protection of controlled information. Personnel working closely with unified action partners must be exceptionally vigilant and discerning and consider the risks and advantages of foreign disclosure. When in doubt, personnel consult with their FDR or FDO for guidance. 0D\ FM 6-0 E-1 Appendix E Command Post Battle Drills This appendix describes command post (CP) battle drills and their purpose. The appendix discusses a methodology for developing CP battle drills. The appendix concludes with a discussion of CP battle drill formats. BATTLE DRILLS E-1. A battle drill is a collective action rapidly executed without applying a deliberate decision-making process. Each CP requires the implementation of battle drills to react to a variety of situations that may be encountered while conducting operations. A CP initiates a battle drill on a cue, such as enemy action or a leader’s command. As a trained response to a given stimulus, a battle drill requires minimal leader orders to accomplish. Synchronization and reaction speed are enhanced when CPs identify battle drills, define the battle drills’ required reactions in the unit SOP, and rehearse the drills during training. Typical CP battle drills include, but are not limited to— z React to an air, ground, or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack. z React to indirect fire. z React to jamming or suspected communications compromise. z Execute dynamic targeting (including time sensitive targets and targets of opportunity). z React to immediate air support requests. z Execute a close air support mission or joint fires mission. z React to a cyber-intrusion or attack. z React to a mass casualty incident (including suspected civilian casualties). z React to a civil riot or incident. z React to a natural disaster. z React to an outbreak of epidemic disease. z React to significant collateral damage. z React to disinformation or propaganda affecting an operational environment. z React to a degraded network. z React to lost communications with friendly units. z React to a Soldier or unit isolating event. z React to fratricide. z React to friendly positions being overrun by hostile forces. z Execute emergency evacuation and relocation of a CP. z React to downed aircraft. z Execute personnel recovery. z React to unauthorized cross-border or boundary intrusion. E-2. CP battle drills are very similar to standard operating procedures (SOPs); however, they differ in that battle drills require an immediate response when the trigger is initiated for a given event (or situation). For example, a CP will have an SOP that guides the execution of CP security operations. A battle drill will address the immediate actions required when reacting to an enemy attack or other significant event. E-3. Situations that require the implementation of CP battle drills generally fall into two categories: direct action against the CP itself and actions that occur away from the CP that require rapid decision making and Appendix E E-2 FM 6-0 0D\ collective support across the CP functional cells. To understand battle drills and how to employ them, it is important to know their purpose and characteristics. PURPOSE OF COMMAND POST BATTLE DRILLS E-4. Units conduct CP battle drills to achieve an advantage in controlling the tempo of anticipated collective tasks routinely executed in a time-constrained environment. CP battle drills allow units to perform basic functions without hesitation or without further coordination, assistance, or delay. These drills are not designed for a specific unit type. Rather, they represent a common methodology for performing common recurring tasks. CHARACTERISTICS OF COMMAND POST BATTLE DRILLS E-5. CP battle drills have several specific characteristics. These drills— z Require speed in execution. z Require minimal leader orders to accomplish. z Are based on mission variables and can be changed to fit the needs of the unit. z Are sequential actions vital to success in operations or critical to preserving life and resources. z Are trained responses to enemy actions, emergencies, or leaders’ orders. E-6. Rehearsals are key to the success of CP battle drills. Units need to practice each drill until CP personnel can execute it to standard. Rehearsing CP battle drills ensures— z All CP personnel understand and demonstrate the ability to execute the battle drill. z Leaders discover and correct improper execution of battle drills. z Leaders fully integrate all assets in the CP and any planned potential support from other elements in the area of operations. z CP personnel have confidence in their abilities and are fully prepared to execute CP battle drills. E-7. When possible, CP personnel conduct an after action review to determine how to improve the battle drill or better adjust it to fit the dynamics of the area of operations and the organization’s mission sets. Following the after action review, staffs usually update CP battle drill SOPs by incorporating any changes and improvements. COMMAND POST BATTLE DRILL DEVELOPMENT E-8. Each unit or staff develops its own battle drills to address anticipated situations that require immediate action. Trained responses are like reflexes, and they result from continual practice. Battle drills provide units and staffs with the SOPs essential for building effective and timely reactions to specific situations. IDENTIFICATION E-9. The start point for determining a list of anticipated CP battle drills begins with a detailed mission analysis of the expected operational environment. Understanding an operational environment is key to units anticipating required routine collective actions. This includes understanding and anticipating how a unit’s higher echelon, adjacent, and supporting organizations may coordinate. A simple technique for identifying battle drills is to— z Understand an operational environment. z Develop a list of all anticipated collective tasks routinely executed in a time-constrained environment. z Review anticipated battle drills for feasibility, acceptability, and suitability. z Refine the list to the minimum essentials and publish each one in the SOP. METHOD E-10. After CP staff members have identified their list of anticipated battle drills, they need to have a method to develop and refine those drills. See Table E-1 for a method to further develop and refine a CP battle drill. Command Post Battle Drills 0D\ FM 6-0 E-3 Table E-1. Command post battle drill method Step CP Battle Drill Description Step 1. Identify the initiating trigger. Every CP battle drill has a key event or events that start or trigger the drill. In some instances, the initiating event may have qualifying criteria such as a specific number of individuals or organizational size (for example, 100 demonstrators or an enemy tank platoon). The specific criteria for initiating event must be included in the CP battle drill format. Step 2. Identify the ending trigger. Just as every CP battle drill has an initiating trigger, it also has an ending trigger. The ending trigger is best described as a set of clearly defined conditions that, once achieved, trigger a decision to end the drill. Once the unit has an ending trigger, it can resume regular operations, continue the drill until it achieves a new set of conditions or effects (must be defined by drill leader if not part of the established battle drill), or hand off any remaining tasks to a specified organization or agency. Step 3. Establish an alert procedure. The organization determines an alert procedure to announce that a CP battle drill initiating event has occurred. This alert can be a standardized announcement, such as “attention in the CP,” or a unique alert established for each drill. Regardless of the method chosen, the published format of the battle drill identifies its method for alerting all participating members. Step 4. Establish a method that provides current common situational awareness. Units have a method for ensuring that all participants know the “who, what, when, where, and why” (known as the 5 Ws) of the initiating event. It provides the current common situational awareness. A standard method reaches all relevant echelons and provides a foundation for participating drill members to receive guidance and other relevant information and data. The more standardized this procedure is, the more foundational it becomes. For example, key CP cell members report to the current operations integration cell once the alert is given. Step 5. Identify key information requirements, necessary decisions, and the decision authority for achieving the ending trigger for the CP battle drill. This is the most important element of the CP battle drill. Organization must identify— x Information requirements. x Necessary decisions. x Necessary decision authority. This produces the required actions, decisions, and information along with the people responsible for making it happen. Step 6. Assign responsibilities and decision authority. Responsibilities for who does what during each drill must be defined. Commanders consider establishing responsibilities for who leads the drill, who records the drill, and who has the authority to determine when the appropriate actions have been taken to achieve the ending trigger conditions. Step 7. Establish a CP battle drill process. The CP battle drill process is unique to every organization. Each organization needs an SOP to record the specific process, and it must rehearse the individual battle drills to be of any value. A sample battle drill process is— x Develop a CP battle drill template (a standard format for the SOP). x Develop reporting and recording tools. x Develop an AAR procedure for executing and rehearsing CP battle drills. x Develop a process for capturing information and extrapolating decisions. AAR after action review SOP standard operating procedure CP command post COMMAND POST BATTLE DRILL FORMATS E-11. There is no standard CP battle drill format. The two prominent styles for documenting CP battle drills are flow charts and tables. The format chosen is irrelevant as long as it is consistent and understood in the unit SOP, it includes all critical elements, and the unit can effectively perform the battle drill. Appendix E E-4 FM 6-0 0D\ FLOWCHART FORMAT E-12. A flowchart is a commonly used type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. It shows the steps as boxes and their order connecting arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem or CP battle drill. Figure E-1 provides an example of a react to indirect fire CP battle drill in the flowchart format. Figure E-1. Sample flowchart for command post battle drill: react to indirect fire TABLE FORMAT FOR A COMMAND POST BATTLE DRILL E-13. The table format is a simple but effective technique for documenting battle drills. Rather than a to-do list, it is a focused checklist of steps to execute a specific task. The steps can be listed in sequence or by function. Table E-2 provides an example of a react to a Soldier or unit isolating event command post battle drill in table format. Table E-2. Sample table for command post battle drill: react to a Soldier or unit isolating event Entity Responsibility Current operations integration cell x Receives and confirms information that a Soldier, U.S. citizen, or contractor is missing; a Soldier, U.S. citizen, or contractor is believed to be captured; or a coalition aircraft has executed an emergency landing. x Obtains the following information: POC of unit making report, type of victim in incident, location, time of abduction, how abduction occurred, units operating in current area of operations, potential suspects. x Activates the PRCC.

United States Appendix E E-6 FM 6-0 0D\ CONCLUSION E-14. Tactical flexibility requires well-trained forces with sound CP battle drills, leaders capable of adapting to rapidly changing circumstances, and staffs able to recognize significant changes in the situation and resynchronize the operation by coordinating changes to the plan.A clear commander’s intent allows subordinates to exercise initiative promptly and effectively and enhances the capability of the overall force to react to changes in the situation. Leaders must be knowledgeable and able to follow unit SOPs and CP battle drills in timely and coherent manners. Well-developed CP battle drills are an excellent guide and reference, but they may not cover every unanticipated event. Therefore, leaders must also be dynamic, proactive, critical thinkers, and determine when it is prudent to deviate from published CP battle drills, as the situation requires to meet the commander’s intent and to achieve the best possible outcome for friendly forces. 0D\ FM 6-0 F-1 Appendix F After Action Reports This appendix discusses how to plan for and use the after action report and includes a sample after action report format. ORGANIZATION OF THE AFTER ACTION REPORT F-1. An important collection technique used by Army echelons and organizations is an after action report. The after action report provides observations and insights from the lessons learned that allow a unit to reflect on successes and shortcomings of the operation as well as share these lessons with the Army. Leaders can use the after action report for building future training plans or for planning for future operations. F-2. The after action report differs from the after action review. An after action review brings together Soldiers to have a verbal discussion held at the completion of an operation or event. Key participants determine what happened, what worked, what did not work, and how to improve for the next event. The after action report is a written document that highlights unit accomplishments and lessons learned. The after action report works well as a historical reference tool and is given to other organizations getting ready to participate in the same event. For more information on after action review, please see FM 7-0. F-3. The reporting unit logically organizes the after action report, usually by operational phase or warfighting function. Often units arrange it chronologically to facilitate the understanding and flow of the information reported. The after action report is not meant to critique an operation. Instead, it documents what worked well as much as what did not work well. F-4. Figure F-1 serves as a sample format to what a commander may cover in the unit’s written after action report. The after action report provides tactics, techniques, and procedures as well as lessons learned to share with the Army. For example, the Center for Army Lessons Learned archives its collected after action reports and makes them available through its website to units preparing for combat operations or training events. F-5. The after action report format is flexible so long as it addresses its two key purposes. First, an after action report documents the operations conducted by the unit for historical purposes. Second, an after action report provides best practices and lessons in the observation-discussion-recommendation format. The Army’s lesson learned program can use this format to inform. F-6. Units can easily adapt an after action report to fit any lessons learned program. Figure F-1 illustrates a brigade after action report. This after action report template can apply across all echelons. 1. Report cover page: a. Classification. b. Preparing headquarters or organization. c. Location of report preparation. d.

Sample brigade after action report format (continued) Appendix F F-4 FM 6-0 0D\ CONCLUSION F-7. After action reports are useful tools for recording challenges or successes identified during operations. Unit leaders may review after action reports to revise standard operating procedures and ensure that units implement change or reinforce successful techniques during future operations. Leaders can use the knowledge that after action reports capture to build future training plans or plan for future operations. These improvements may enhance future unit performance. 0D\ FM 6-0 Glossary-1 Glossary The glossary lists acronyms and terms with Army and joint definitions.

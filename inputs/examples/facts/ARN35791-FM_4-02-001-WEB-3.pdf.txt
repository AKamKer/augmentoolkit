F-10 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 vii Preface FM 4-02 provides doctrine for the Army Health System (AHS) in support of the modular force. The AHS is the overarching concept of support for providing timely AHS support to the tactical commander. It discusses the current AHS force structure which was modernized under the Department of the Army-approved Medical Reengineering Initiative and the Modular Medical Force. These modernization efforts were designed to support the brigade combat teams and echelons above brigade units. The principal audience for FM 4-02 is all members of the profession of arms. Commanders and staffs of Army headquarters serving as joint task force or multinational headquarters should also refer to applicable joint or multinational doctrine concerning the range of military operations and joint or multinational forces. Trainers and educator throughout the Army will also use this publication. Commanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure that their decisions and actions comply with applicable United States, international, and in some cases host-nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels ensure that their Soldiers operate in accordance with the law of war and the rules of engagement. (See FM 6- 27/MCTP 11-10C). It is to be used as a guide in both obtaining and providing AHS support in an area of operations. Information in this publication is applicable to decisive actions in support of unified land operations. It is compatible with the Army’s sustainment and protection doctrine and is also in agreement with Joint Publication 4-02. This publication implements or is in consonance with the following North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreements (STANAGs); American, British, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand (ABCANZ) Standards.

Selected joint and Army terms and definitions appear in both the glossary and the text. Terms for which FM 4-02 is the proponent publication (the authority) are italicized in the text and are marked with an asterisk (*) in the glossary. Terms and definitions for which FM 4-02 is the proponent publication are boldfaced in the text. For other definitions shown in the text, the term is italicized and the number of the proponent publication follows the definition. This publication applies to the Active Army, Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States, United States Army Reserve, Army Civilian Corps, and Army contracted medical providers, unless otherwise stated. Preface viii FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Due to the nature of the medical profession which is highly regulated throughout both the civilian and military communities, Army Medicine doctrine is heavily influenced by—  United States and international law (including respective U.S. and allied-nation health regulating agencies).  Policy guidance in the form of Army Regulations and Department of Defense (DOD) policy promulgated in the form of DOD Directives (DODD) and DOD Instructions (DODI) and other documents.  Medical standards established by civilian organizations (such as The Joint Commission).  Technical guidance from both military and civilian organizations charged with medical/scientific oversight responsibilities. Throughout this publication, as appropriate, reference is made to the major policy guidance impacting each specific topic. These references should not be considered as the only policy guidance available. When issues arise that require consideration of policy guidance, the issue should be thoroughly researched and, as appropriate, coordinated with the supporting staff judge advocate or governmental/nongovernmental agency involved. The proponent of FM 4-02 is the United States Army Medical Center of Excellence. The preparing agency is the Doctrine Literature Division, United States Army Medical Center of Excellence.

Key topics include AHS, FHP, Health Service Support, ten medical functions, and law of land warfare and medical ethics. The material presented in this publication reflects enduring practices in providing timely AHS support to the tactical commander. This publication depicts AHS operations from the point of injury or wounding through successive roles of care within the area of operations and evacuation to the continental United States-support base. Summary of changes include:  Aligning this publication with Army hierarchy publications including FM 3-0 and FM 4-0.  Aligning this publication with Joint Publication 4-02, Joint Health Services’ FHP and HSS definitions and descriptions.  Reorganizing the order of the publication; FHP is now Part Two while HSS is Part Three.  Revising the definitions of the following terms: Army Health System, force health protection, health service support, definitive care, essential care, and triage.  Replacing the mission command medical function with medical command and control; this is in line with ADP 6-0.  Replacing “field preventive medicine” with “operational public health” according to AR 40-5.  Adding Global Health Engagement information.  Adding hospital center information.  Adding an appendix discussing AHS support to the Army’s strategic roles (shape operational environments, prevent conflict, prevail in large-scale ground combat, consolidate gains).  Adding an appendix derived from FM 3-0 discussing command and support relationships.  Adding a surgeon and surgeon section appendix.  Adding the approved medical symbols appendix. As the Army’s AHS doctrine statement, this publication identifies medical functions and procedures that are essential for operations covered in other Army Medicine proponent manuals. This publication depicts AHS operations from the point of injury or wounding, through successive roles of care within the area of operations, and evacuation to the continental United States (U.S.)-support base. It presents a stable body of operational doctrine rooted in actual military experience and serves as a foundation for the development of Army Medicine proponent manuals on how the AHS supports unified land operations. The AHS mission falls within two warfighting functions- protection and sustainment. To clearly delineate the two AHS missions of force health protection (FHP) and health service support (HSS), this publication is divided into three parts- AHS overview, FHP, and HSS. Field Manual 4-02 consists of three parts and 12 chapters: Part One, AHS, provides a holistic view of the entire AHS and the complexities and interdependence of each medical function in successfully accomplishing the Army Medicine’s mission to conserve the fighting strength. This part of the manual describes and provides operational guidance on the AHS’s echelon above brigade headquarters, as well as the medical aspects of the law of land warfare.  Chapter 1 provides an overview of the AHS to include introduction information on tactical combat casualty care, global health engagement, and the AHS principles.  Chapter 2 discusses AHS command and control, overview of Army echelons, Army command and support relationships, the AHS Team and its primary tasks, medical command and control Introduction x FM 4-02 17 November 2020 organizations, and the roles and responsibilities of the medical commander, command surgeon, and commander.  Chapter 3 provides information regarding AHS and the effects of the law of land warfare and medical ethics information.  Chapter 4 discusses Army Health System operations; operational and mission variables; AHS support to decisive action- offensive, defensive, stability tasks, defense support of civil authorities; setting the theater; detainee operations; and maneuver units. Part Two, FHP, encompasses the preventive and treatment aspects of the following medical functions: veterinary services, combat and operational stress control, dental services, operational public health, and laboratory services (area medical laboratory) including the testing of suspect biological and chemical warfare agent samples.  Chapter 5 describes operational public health’s mission, primary tasks, organizations and personnel.  Chapter 6 discusses veterinary services missions and primary tasks, consisting of the food protection mission, animal care mission, and veterinary public health.  Chapter 7 provides information on combat and operational stress control including primary tasks, responsibilities, and programs and resources.  Chapter 8 provides information on the preventive and treatment aspects of dental services.  Chapter 9 discusses environmental and clinical medical laboratory services. Part Three, HSS, encompasses medical treatment, medical evacuation (including medical regulating), and medical logistics (including blood management). Health services support three mission sets include all of the medical functions involved with direct patient care (medical treatment [organic and area support] and hospitalization) to include diagnostic medical laboratories and the medical functions of medical evacuation and medical logistics.  Chapter 10 discusses direct patient activities including medical treatment (organic and area support) and theater hospitalization (combat support hospital and hospital center).  Chapter 11 provides information on medical evacuation to include integrated medical evacuation system, medical regulating, and strategic medical evacuation and patient movement. Chapter 12 discusses medical logistics to include medical logistics management in an operational environment, medical logistics command and control organizations, medical logistics support for Roles 1 through 3 medical treatment facilities, and as theater lead agent for medical materiel and the single integrated medical logistics manager. The Medical Center of Excellence, Doctrine Literature Division is reorganizing the placement of terms and definitions found in proponent publications within the Army Medicine Doctrine Publication Library. It was determined that some of the terms are best suited in other publications within the Army Medicine Doctrine Publication Library. Based on current doctrinal changes, certain terms for which FM 4-02 is proponent have been added, rescinded, or modified for purposes of this publication. The glossary contains acronyms an defined terms. See introductory table-1, introductory table-2 on page xi for specific term changes. Introductory Table-1.

This page intentionally left blank. 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 1-1 PART ONE Army Health System The Army Health System (AHS) is a component of the Military Health System (MHS) that is responsible for operational management of the health service support and force health protection missions for training, predeployment, deployment, and postdeployment operations. The Army Health System includes all mission support services performed, provided, or arranged by the Army Medicine to support health service support (HSS) and force health protection (FHP) mission requirements for the Army and as directed, for joint, intergovernmental agencies, coalition, and multinational forces. The AHS is a complex system of systems that is interdependent and interrelated and requires continual planning, coordination, and synchronization to effectively and efficiently clear the battlefield of casualties and to provide the highest standard of care to our wounded or ill Soldiers. Part One of this publication provides a holistic view of the AHS; specifically describing its composition, along with its  overarching architecture of its design and functions without regard to the specific warfighting functions under which it operates. This part of the publication— ● Discusses the foundations of the Army Medicine and the fundamental principles which have guided the provision of AHS support on the battlefield throughout its history. It describes the roles of medical care which facilitate providing care at the point of injury (POI) or wounding and describes the system of phased and incrementally increasing capabilities which enables the wounded or ill Soldier to be stabilized and evacuated to the appropriate medical treatment facility. The goal is then to care for their specific medical condition and to restore them to health, limit long-term disability, and either return then to duty or to their civilian life as a productive member of that community. The term stabilized patient refers to a patient whose airway is secured, hemorrhage is controlled, shock treated, and fractures are immobilized. (Joint Publication [JP] 4-02) ● Provides an in-depth discussion on the provisions of the Geneva Conventions, the law of land warfare, and medical ethics and their impact on conduct of AHS operations. It describes the primary tasks of the AHS in support of operations characterized by offensive, defensive, stability, and defense support of civil authorities tasks. Further, it discusses AHS support to detainee operations and the roles and responsibilities of the detainee operations medical director. ● Discusses the AHS medical command and control organizations, their functions, and responsibilities. It also provides an in-depth discussion of the Army Medicine team, the medical commander, the command surgeon, and the involvement required of the commander. ● Provides information on the role of the institutional force and the support provided to the operational Army.

Chapter 1 Army Health System Overview The AHS is a component of the Department of Defense (DOD) MHS. Although the MHS is an interrelated system which may share medical services, capabilities, and specialties among the United States (U.S.) Service components, it is not a joint command and control system. Each Service component develops its medical resources to support its Service-specific mission. This results in the development of different types of organizations with varying levels of capability, mobility, and survivability. Although joint medical resources may have similar nomenclature to describe the unit, they are not usually interchangeable. For information on joint health services refer to JP 4-02. SECTION I — OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT 1-1. The Army accomplishes its mission by supporting the joint force in four strategic roles: shape operational environments, prevent conflict, conduct large-scale ground combat operations, and consolidate gains. The benchmark for Army readiness is its ability to conduct large-scale combat operations (LSCO) fighting a near peer/peer threat with potential overmatch across multiple domains (including land, air, maritime, space, cyberspace as well as electromagnetic spectrum and information environment). 1-2. A multi-domain approach to operations is not new. Army forces have effectively integrated capabilities and synchronized actions in the air, land, and maritime domains for decades. Rapid and continued advances in technology and the military application of new technologies to the space domain, the electromagnetic spectrum, and the information environment (particularly cyberspace) require special consideration in planning and converging effects from across all domains. Refer to FM 3-0 for more information. THREATS 1-3. An operational environment (OE) has a number of threats that consist of enemies, adversaries, neutrals, and hybrid threats (force that combines traditional, irregular, disruptive, or catastrophic capabilities). These threats are protracted confrontation among individuals, groups of individuals, paramilitary or military forces, state actors, and nonstate actors increasingly willing to use violence to achieve their political and ideological ends. There is a probability that in the future, United States Army forces will conduct operations in an urban environment and in and around megacities. Urban areas are becoming safe havens and support bases for terrorists, insurgents, or criminal organizations. For information on the OE see FM 3-0. 1-4. Commanders and staffs analyze an OE using the eight operational variables: political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, and time (See FM 6-0 for more information on the operational variables). Army Health System Overview 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 1-3 1-5. The Army Medicine views threats from two perspectives:  the general threat and the health threat. Although the Army Medicine’s primary concern is that of the health threat, the general threat must also be fully considered as it influences the—  Character, types, and severity of wounds and injuries to which our forces may be exposed.  Enemy’s ability and willingness to disrupt AHS operations and to respect the conditions of the Geneva Conventions in regards to the protection of AHS personnel while engaged in their humanitarian mission. HEALTH THREAT 1-6. The health threat faced by deployed U.S. forces is depicted in Table 1-1. The health threat is a composite of ongoing or potential enemy actions; adverse environmental, occupational, and geographic and meteorological conditions; endemic and emerging diseases; and employment of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons (to include weapons of mass destruction that have the potential to affect the short- or long-term health [including psychological impact] of personnel). Table 1-1. Health threat Injuries Musculoskeletal injuries (primarily from physical training and recreational activities) Diseases Endemic, emerging, epidemic, and pandemic Foodborne Fomites Waterborne Arthropodborne Zoonotic Breeding grounds for vectors Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH) hazards Climatic (heat, cold, humidity, and significant elevations above sea level) Toxic industrial materials Accidental or deliberate dispersion of chemical, biological, and radiological material Disruption of sanitation services/facilities (such as sewage and waste disposal) Effects of industrial operations and industrial and operational noise Poisonous or toxic flora and fauna Toxic poisonous plants, bacteria, and fungus Poisonous reptiles, amphibians, arthropods, and animals Medical effects of weapons Conventional (to include blast and mild traumatic brain injury/concussion) Improvised (to include improvised explosive devices) Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear warfare agents Directed energy Weapons of mass destruction Thermal (from nuclear blast or direct energy) Combined injury (chemical, biological, radiological agent plus thermal, blast, explosive, or projectiles) Physiologic and psychological stressors Continuous operations Combat and operational stress reactions Wear of mission-oriented protective posture ensemble Stability tasks Home front issues Chapter 1 1-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 SECTION II — WARFIGHTING FUNCTIONS 1-7. The Army Health System medical capabilities (ten medical functions) are grouped under two Army warfighting functions- FHP under protection and HSS under sustainment warfighting functions. These interrelated and interdependent medical functions are complex in nature and require medical command and control for synchronization and integration. This ensures the interrelationships and interoperability of all medical assets and optimizes the effective functioning of the entire system. To clearly delineate which medical functions are grouped under which warfighting function, the Army is aligning with the joint Services (according to JP 4-02) in grouping these ten medical functions. SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS 1-8. The AHS is a complex system of systems (Figure 1-1). The systems which comprise the AHS are divided into medical functions which align with medical disciplines and scientific knowledge. These systems are interrelated and interdependent and must be meticulously and continuously synchronized to reduce morbidity and mortality and to maximize patient outcome. The ten medical functions are:  Medical command and control.  Medical treatment (organic and area support).  Hospitalization.  Medical evacuation (to include medical regulating).  Dental services.  Operational public health.  Combat and operational stress control.  Veterinary services.  Medical logistics (to include blood management).  Medical laboratory services (to include both clinical laboratories and environmental laboratories). 1-9. The AHS medical functions are in consonance with joint doctrine, as described in JP 4-02. Figure 1- 2 below depicts the Army Health System operational framework. For more information on operational framework refer to ADP 3-0 and FM 3-0. FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION MISSION 1-10. The Army force health protection are measures that promote, improve, or conserve the behavioral and physical well-being of Soldiers comprised of preventive and treatment aspects of medical functions that include: combat and operational stress control, dental services, veterinary services, operational public health, and laboratory services. Enabling a healthy and fit force, prevent injury and illness, and protect the force from health hazards. HEALTH SERVICE SUPPORT MISSION 1-11. The Army health service support is support and services performed, provided, and arranged by the Army Medicine to promote, improve, conserve, or restore the behavioral and physical well-being of personnel by providing direct patient care that include medical treatment (organic and area support) and hospitalization, medical evacuation to include medical regulating, and medical logistics to include blood management. Additionally, as directed, provide support in other Services, agencies, and organizations. Health service support includes the treatment of CBRN patients. Army Health System Overview 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 1-5 Figure 1-1. System of systems Figure 1-2. Army Health System support operational framework Chapter 1 1-6 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 SECTION III — TACTICAL COMBAT CASUALTY CARE 1-12. Tactical combat casualty care (TCCC) is divided into the three phases- care under fire, tactical field care, and tactical evacuation care. Tactical combat casualty care occurs during a combat mission and is the military counterpart to prehospital emergency medical treatment. Tactical combat casualty care in the military is most commonly provided by enlisted personnel and includes self-aid and buddy aid (first aid), combat lifesaver (enhanced first aid), and enlisted combat medics and critical care flight paramedics in the Army, corpsmen in the United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard, and both medics and pararescue men in the United States Air Force (USAF). Tactical combat casualty care focuses on the most likely threats, injuries, and conditions encountered in combat and on a strictly limited range of interventions directed at the most serious of these threats and conditions. CARE UNDER FIRE 1-13. In the care under fire phase, combat medical personnel and their units are under effective hostile fire and are very limited in the care they can provide. In essence, only those lifesaving interventions that must be performed immediately are undertaken during this phase. TACTICAL FIELD CARE 1-14. During the tactical field care phase, medical personnel and their patients are no longer under effective hostile fire and medical personnel can provide more extensive patient care. In this phase, interventions directed at other life-threatening conditions, as well as resuscitation and other measures to increase the comfort of the patient may be performed. Physicians and physician assistants at battalion aid stations or during tailgate medicine support also provide TCCC. During tactical field care, personnel must be prepared to transition back to care under fire, or to prepare the casualty for tactical evacuation, as the tactical situation dictates. Tailgate medical support refers to an economy of force device employed primarily to retain maximum mobility during movement halts or to avoid the time and effort required to set up a formal, operational treatment facility (for example, during rapid advance and retrograde operations). For more information on tactical field care see ATP 4-02.3. TACTICAL EVACUATION 1-15. In the tactical evacuation phase, casualties are transported from the battlefield to medical treatment facilities (MTFs). Medical treatment facility refers to any facility established for the purpose of providing medical treatment. This includes battalion aid stations, Role 2 facilities, dispensaries, clinics, and hospitals. Evacuation can be by either medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) (dedicated platforms [ground or air] manned with dedicated medical providers) or casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) (ranging from nondedicated, but tasked, platforms [ground or air] augmented with medical equipment and providers to platforms of opportunity without medical equipment or providers). Note. The TCCC initiative originated with the Naval Special Warfare Command and later continued by the United States Special Operations Command. Special operations forces do not have a dedicated, designed, and equipped MEDEVAC capability. Therefore, they use nonmedical platforms augmented with medical personnel to perform the evacuation function. The conventional force doctrinal categories of MEDEVAC and CASEVAC as defined in Army doctrine on MEDEVAC are not changed, however, during this phase of TCCC both types of evacuation occur depending upon the availability of assets and the time window available to execute the evacuation process. Time is of the essence to remove the casualty as quickly as possible to where further treatment can be provided. Army Health System Overview 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 1-7 CASUALTY EVACUATION 1-16. Casualty evacuation is the movement of casualties aboard nonmedical vehicles or aircraft without en route medical care. Also called CASEVAC. (Currently the proponent for this term is FM 4-02 but will be moved to ATP 4-02.13 when revised).Casualty evacuation encompasses a wide spectrum of potential capability- depending on the mix of transport platform, medical equipment, and medical providers allocated to the mission. At the upper end of the spectrum, nondedicated platforms can be outfitted with the requisite medical equipment and MEDEVAC assets. At the lower end of the spectrum, CASEVAC can be no more than the transport of casualties using platforms of opportunity with no medical equipment or medical providers (in using such assets, the risk of not moving the casualty must outweigh the risk evacuating him/her in such a manner). Effective CASEVAC complements MEDEVAC by providing additional evacuation capacity when number of casualties (workload) or reaction time exceeds the capabilities of MEDEVAC assets. Casualty evacuation requires detailed assessment and planning in order to achieve an effective integration of MEDEVAC and CASEVAC capabilities. For more information on CASEVAC, refer to ATP 4-25.13. For more information on MEDEVAC, refer to ATP 4-02.2. WARNING Casualties transported in CASEVAC platform may not receive proper en route medical care or be transported to the appropriate MTF that can best address the casualty’s medical needs. This may have an adverse impact on the casualty’s prognosis, long- term disability or even death may result. MEDICAL EVACUATION 1-17. Medical evacuation is the timely and effective movement of the wounded, injured, or ill to and between medical treatment facilities on dedicated and properly marked medical platforms with en route care provided by medical personnel. Also called MEDEVAC (ATP 4-02.2). A patient is a sick, injured or wounded individual who receives medical care or treatment from medically trained personnel. 1-18. The Army MEDEVAC system is comprised of dedicated, standardized MEDEVAC platforms (ground and air ambulances). These ambulances have been designed, staffed, and equipped to provide en route medical care to patients being evacuated and are used exclusively to support the medical mission, in accordance with the law of land warfare and the Geneva Conventions. The focus of the MEDEVAC mission coupled with the dedicated ambulances permit a rapid response to calls for medical support. The provision of en route care on medically equipped vehicles or aircraft greatly enhances the patient’s potential for recovery and may reduce long-term disability by maintaining the patient’s medical condition in a more stable manner. En route care refers to the care required to maintain the phased treatment initiated prior to evacuation and the sustainment of the patient’s medical condition during evacuation. (ATP 4-02.2). 1-19. The United States Army is tasked with providing intratheater aeromedical evacuation (AE) as the only Service with dedicated air ambulances. The United States Army provides intratheater AE to all land maneuver forces (once ashore) and also provides support to ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship patient movement requirements. 1-20. The USAF AE system operates within the “operational or strategic” environment and provides the vital linkage between the roles of care for regulated patients over extended distances and to continental United States (CONUS) for final patient disposition. The USAF AE is performed by designated fixed-wing platforms configured with standardized medical equipment and staffed with medical professionals who provide the timely, efficient movement and en route care of the wounded, injured, or ill personnel. The standardization of equipment and medical professionals aboard USAF AE assets ensures the continuity of care between roles of medical care. For these reasons, USAF AE is the sole provider of patient movement from Role 3 to Role 4 and is the preferred means of patient movement over great distances within a given area of operations (AO). Patient movement is the act of moving a sick, injured, wounded, or other person to Chapter 1 1-8 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 obtain medical and/or dental treatment. Functions include medical regulating, patient evacuation, and en route medical care. (ATP 4-02.2). For more information on aeromedical evacuation, refer to DODD 5100.01, JP 4-02, and ATP 4-02.2. PATIENT EVACUATION 1-21. In today’s OE, the reduced medical footprint forward places a high demand on en route care capabilities. Consequently, patient evacuation capabilities are even more critical than in the past and the United States Army in coordination with the other Service medical elements must integrate with lift operations, as well as with the associated capabilities of multinational forces. SECTION IV — ARMY HEALTH SYSTEM PRINCIPLES 1-22. The principles of the AHS are the foundation (enduring fundamentals) upon which the delivery of health care in a field environment is founded. The principles guide medical planners in developing operation plans (OPLANs) which are effective, efficient, flexible, and executable. Army Health System support plans are designed to support the operational commander’s scheme of maneuver while still retaining a focus on the delivery of health care. 1-23. The AHS principles apply across all medical functions and are synchronized through medical command and control and close coordination and synchronization of all deployed medical assets through medical technical channels. Figure 1-3 depicts the AHS principles. Figure 1-3. Army Health System Principles CONFORMITY 1-24. Conformity with the operation order (OPORD) is the most basic element for effectively providing AHS support. In order to develop a comprehensive concept of operations, the medical commander must have direct access to the operational commander. Army Health System planners must be involved early in the planning process to ensure that we continue to provide AHS support in support of the Army’s strategic roles of shape OEs, prevent conflict, prevail in large-scale ground combat, consolidate gains and once the plan is established it must be rehearsed with the forces it supports. In operations with a preponderance of stability tasks, it is essential that AHS support operations are in consonance with the combatant commander’s (CCDR) area of responsibility (AOR) engagement strategy and have been thoroughly coordinated with the supporting assistant chief of staff, civil affairs (CA) operations (G-9). Army Health System Overview 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 1-9 PROXIMITY 1-25. Proximity is to provide AHS support to sick, injured, and wounded Soldiers at the right time and the right place and to keep morbidity and mortality to a minimum. Army Health System support assets are placed within supporting distance of the maneuver forces which they are supporting, but not close enough to impede ongoing operations. To support the operational commander’s plan, it is essential that AHS assets are positioned to rapidly locate, acquire, treat, stabilize, and evacuate combat casualties. Peak workloads for AHS resources occur during combat operations. FLEXIBILITY 1-26. Flexibility is being prepared to, and empowered to, shift AHS resources to meet changing requirements. Changes in plans or operations make flexibility in AHS planning and execution essential. In addition to building flexibility into the OPLAN to support the commander’s scheme of maneuver, the medical commander must also ensure that he has the flexibility to rapidly support the transition from one level of violence to another across the competition continuum (cooperation, competition below armed conflict, and armed conflict). Medical commanders may be supporting simultaneous actions characterized by decisive action elements- offensive, defensive, and stability. The medical commanders exercise their command authority to effectively manage their scarce medical resources so that they benefit the greatest number of Soldiers. For example, there are insufficient numbers of forward surgical teams (FSTs) or forward resuscitative surgical detachments (FRSDs) to permit the habitual assignment of these organizations to each brigade combat team (BCT). Therefore, the medical commander, in conjunction with the command surgeon, closely monitors these valuable assets so that he can rapidly reallocate or recommend the reallocation of this lifesaving skill to the BCTs in contact with the enemy and where the highest number of Soldiers will potentially receive traumatic wounds and injuries. Prolonged combat, intense engagements, and LSCO diminish unit combat effectiveness. When a medical unit is degraded to become combat ineffective and no longer able to provide AHS support effectively, reconstitution may be required. 1-27. Reconstitution consists of those actions that commanders plan and implement to restore units to a desired level of combat effectiveness commensurate with mission requirements and available resources (ATP 3-21.20). Reconstitution may include: removing a unit from combat, assessing it with external assets, reestablishing a chain of command, training a unit for future operations, and reestablishing unit cohesion. For more information on reconstitution, refer to FM 4-0 and ADP 3-90. 1-28. Maximizing the return to duty rate of injured or ill personnel in forward operating units is a major portion of the AHS contribution to the reconstitution effort. Maximizing the return to duty rate of combat Soldiers contributes to the pool of personnel available for reconstitution of degraded units. MOBILITY 1-29. Mobility is the principle that ensures that AHS assets remain in supporting distance to support maneuvering forces. The mobility, survivability (such as armor plating), and sustainability of AHS units organic to maneuver elements must be equal to the forces being supported. Major AHS headquarters in echelons above brigade (EAB) continually assess and forecast unit movement and redeployment. Army Health System support must be continually responsive to shifting medical requirements in an OE. In noncontiguous operations, the use of ground ambulances may be limited depending on the security threat in unassigned areas and air ambulance use may be limited by environmental conditions and enemy air defense threat. Therefore, to facilitate a continuous evacuation flow, MEDEVAC must be a synchronized effort to ensure timely, responsive, and effective support is provided to the tactical commander. The only means available to increase the mobility of AHS units is to evacuate all patients they are holding. Army Health System units anticipating an influx of patients must medically evacuate patients they have on hand prior to the start of the engagement. CONTINUITY 1-30. Continuity in care and treatment is achieved by moving the patient through progressive, phased roles of care, extending from the POI or wounding to the CONUS-support base. Continuity of care refers to an Chapter 1 1-10 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 attempt to maintain the role of care during movement at least equal to the care provided at the preceding facility. Each type of AHS unit contributes a measured, logical increment in care appropriate to its location and capabilities. In recent operations, lower casualty rates, availability of rotary-wing air ambulances, and other mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations factors often enable a patient to be evacuated from the POI directly to the supporting combat support hospital (CSH) or hospital center. In more traditional operations, higher casualty rates, extended distances, and patient condition may necessitate that patients receive care at each role of care to maintain their physiologic status and enhance their chances of survival. The medical commanders, with their depth of medical knowledge, their ability to anticipate follow-on medical treatment requirements, and their assessment of the availability of their specialized medical resources can adjust the patient flow to ensure each Soldiers receive the care required to optimize patient outcome. The medical commander can recommend changes in the theater evacuation policy to adjust patient flow within the deployed setting. A major consideration and an emerging concern in future conflicts is providing prolonged care at the point of need when evacuation is delayed. The Army’s future OE is likely to be complex and challenging and widely differs from previous conflicts. Operational factors will require the provision of medical care to a wide range of combat and noncombat casualties for prolonged periods that exceed current evacuation planning factors. CONTROL 1-31. Control is required to ensure that scarce AHS resources are efficiently employed and support the operational and strategic plan. It also ensures that the scope and quality of medical treatment meets professional standards, policies, and U.S. and international law. As the Army Medicine is comprised of 10 medical functions which are interdependent and interrelated, control of AHS support operations requires synchronization to ensure the complex interrelationships and interoperability of all medical assets remain in balance to optimize the effective functioning of the entire system. Within the operational area, the most qualified individuals to orchestrate this complex support are the medical commanders due to their training, professional knowledge, education, and experience. In a joint and multinational environment it is essential that coordination be accomplished across all Services and unified action partners to leverage all of the specialized skills within the operational area. Due to specialization and the low density of some medical skills within the MHS force structure, the providers may only exist in one Service (for example, the U.S.
Army has the only Veterinary Corps officers in the MHS). ROLES OF MEDICAL CARE 1-32. A basic characteristic of organizing modern AHS support is the distribution of medical resources and capabilities to facilities at various levels of command, diverse locations, and progressive capabilities, which are referred to as roles of care. Definitive care refers to care or treatment which returns an ill or injured Soldier achieving maximum medical improvement. 1-33. Definitive care embraces all care, treatment, and medical interventions provided at any role of medical care. These interventions can range from self-aid when a Soldier applies a dressing to a grazing bullet wound that heals without further intervention; to two weeks bed-rest in theater for the treatment of Dengue fever; to multiple surgeries and extensive rehabilitation with a prosthesis at a CONUS-based medical center or Department of Veterans Affairs hospital after a traumatic amputation. Injured Soldiers' dispositions may range from return to full duty without limitations to medical discharge from the military secondary to persistent physical limitations resulting from illness or injury. 1-34. Definitive treatment refers to the final role of comprehensive care provided to return the patient to the highest degree of mental and physical health possible. It is not associated with a specific role or location in the continuum of care; it may occur in different roles depending upon the nature of the injury or illness. 1-35. As a general rule, no role of care will be bypassed except on grounds of medical urgency, efficiency, or expediency. The rationale for this rule is to ensure the stabilization/survivability of the patient through TCCC, and far forward resuscitative surgery is accomplished prior to movement between MTFs (Roles 1 through 3). Army Health System Overview 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 1-11 NONMEDICAL PERSONNEL 1-36. Nonmedical personnel performing first aid procedures assist the combat medics in their duties. First aid is administered by an individual (self-aid or buddy aid) and enhanced first aid is provided by the combat lifesavers. A combat lifesaver is a nonmedical Soldier of a unit trained to provide enhanced first aid as a secondary mission. (Currently the proponent is FM 4-02 but will be moved to ATP 4-02.3 when revised). Self-Aid and Buddy Aid 1-37. Each individual Soldier is trained in a variety of specific first aid procedures. These procedures include aid for chemical casualties with particular emphasis on lifesaving tasks. This training enables the Soldier or a buddy to apply first aid to alleviate potential life-threatening situations. Each Soldier is issued an individual first aid kit to accomplish first aid tasks. First aid (self-aid/buddy aid) refers to urgent and immediate lifesaving and other measures which can be performed for casualties (or performed by the victim themselves) by nonmedical personnel when medical personnel are not immediately available. Combat Lifesaver 1-38. The combat lifesaver is a nonmedical Soldier selected by the unit commander for additional training beyond basic first aid procedures. A minimum of one individual per squad, crew, team, or equivalent-sized unit should be trained. The primary duty of this individual does not change. The additional duty of the combat lifesavers is to provide enhanced first aid for injuries, based on their training, before the combat medic arrives. Combat lifesaver training is normally provided by medical personnel during direct support of the unit. The training program is managed by the senior medical person designated by the commander. Members of Special Forces operational detachment teams receive first aid training at the combat lifesaver level. ROLE 1 1-39. The first medical care a Soldier receives is provided at Role 1 (also referred to as unit-level medical care). This role of care includes:  Immediate lifesaving measures.  Disease and nonbattle injury (DNBI) prevention.  Combat and operational stress preventive measures. Patient location and acquisition (collection).  Medical evacuation from supported units (POI or wounding, company aid posts, or casualty/patient collection points) to supporting MTFs.  Treatment provided by designated combat medics or treatment squads. (Major emphasis is placed on those measures necessary for the patients to return to duty or to stabilize them and allow for their evacuation to the next role of care. Return to duty refers to a patient disposition which, after medical evaluation and treatment when necessary, return Soldiers for duty in their unit. These measures include maintaining the airway, stopping bleeding, preventing shock, protecting wounds, immobilizing fractures, and other emergency measures, as indicated). 1-40. Role 1 medical treatment is provided by the combat medic or flight paramedic during air evacuation or by the physician, the physician assistant, or the health care specialist in the battalion aid station/Role 1 MTF. Emergency medical treatment refers to the immediate application of medical procedures to the wounded, injured, or sick by specially trained medical personnel. In Army special operations forces, Role 1 treatment is provided by special operations combat medics, Special Forces medical sergeants, or physicians and physician assistants at forward operating bases, Special Forces operating bases, or in joint special operations task forces. Role 1 includes:  Tactical combat casualty care (immediate far forward care) consists of those lifesaving steps that do not require the knowledge and skills of a physician. The combat medic is the first individual in the medical chain that makes medically substantiated decisions based on medical military occupational specialty-specific training. Chapter 1 1-12 FM 4-02 17 November 2020  At the battalion aid station, the physician and the physician assistant are trained and equipped to provide TCCC to the combat casualty. This element also conducts routine sick call when the operational situation permits. Like elements provide this role of medical care at brigade and EAB.  During MEDEVACs, Role 1 treatment is provided by the combat medic (during ground evacuation) or by the critical care flight paramedic (during air evacuation) to an MTF. Critical care flight paramedics are trained and equipped to provide advanced en route care to the combat casualty. ROLE 2 1-41. At this role, care is rendered at the Role 2 MTF which is operated by the area support squad, medical treatment platoon of medical companies. Here, the patients are examined and their wounds and general medical condition are evaluated to determine their treatment and evacuation precedence, among other patients. Medical treatment including trauma management and beginning resuscitation is continued, and if necessary, additional emergency measures are instituted, but they do not go beyond the measures dictated by immediate necessities. The Role 2 MTF provides a greater capability to resuscitate trauma patients than is available at Role 1. Those patients who can return to duty within 72 hours (1 to 3 days) are held for treatment. This role of care provides MEDEVAC from Role 1 MTFs and also provides Role 1 medical treatment on an area support basis for units without organic Role 1 resources. The Role 2 MTF has the capability to provide packed red blood cells (liquid), limited x-ray, clinical laboratory, operational dental support, combat and operational stress control (COSC), operational public health, and when augmented, physical therapy and optometry services. 1-42. Patients who are nontransportable due to their medical condition may require resuscitative surgical care from an FST or FRSD collocated with a medical company (refer to Army doctrine on the FST or FRSD). Nontransportable patient is a patient whose medical condition is such that he could not survive further evacuation to the rear without surgical intervention to stabilize his medical condition. (ATP 4-02.2). The FST or FRSD is assigned to the medical command (deployment support) or medical brigade and attached to a CSH or hospital center when not operationally employed however, the FST or FRSD is only attached to a medical company for resuscitative surgical care capability support when employed. 1-43. Role 2 AHS assets are located in the—  Medical company (brigade support), assigned to modular brigades which include the armored BCT, infantry BCT, and the Stryker BCT.  Medical company (area support) which is an EAB asset that provides direct support to the modular division and support to EAB units. 1-44. The NATO descriptions of Role 2 are—  A Role 2 Basic MTF can provide reception, triage, resuscitation, and damage control surgery, short term holding capacity for at least six and a postoperative care capability for at least two patients.  An Enhanced Role 2 MTF can provide enhanced diagnostics and mission essential specialist care (including in theater surgery). They have at least two surgical teams, with respective emergency and postoperative care capabilities, x-ray, laboratory, blood bank, pharmacy, sterilization, dentistry, and a short term holding capacity of 25 patients. Note. The United States Army forces subscribe to the basic definition of a Role 2 MTF providing greater resuscitative capability than is available at Role 1. It does not subscribe to the interpretation used by NATO forces Allied Joint Publication-4.10(B) (Role 2 Basic and Role 2 Enhanced) and JP 4-02 (Role 2 Light Maneuver and Role 2 Enhanced) that a surgical capability is mandatory at this role. The United States Army does not provide damage control surgery and does not provide surgical capability at Role 2 unless a FST or FRSD is collocated with the medical company to provide forward surgical intervention. Army Health System Overview 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 1-13 ROLE 3 1-45. At Role 3, the patient is treated in an MTF staffed and equipped to provide care to all categories of patients, to include resuscitation, initial wound surgery, damage control surgery, and postoperative treatment. This role of care expands the support provided at Role 2. Patients who are unable to tolerate and survive movement over long distances receive surgical care in a hospital as close to the supported unit as the tactical situation allows. This role includes provisions for—  Coordination of patient evacuation through medical regulating.  Providing care for all categories of patients in an MTF with the proper staff and equipment.  Providing support on an area basis to units without organic medical assets. 1-46. Role 3 AHS assets are located in the—  Combat support hospital.  Hospital Center. ROLE 4 1-47. Role 4 medical care is found in CONUS-based hospitals and other safe havens (to include robust overseas MTFs). If mobilization requires expansion of military hospital capacities, then the Department of Veterans Affairs and civilian hospital beds in the National Disaster Medical System are added to meet the increased demands created by the evacuation of patients from the operational area. The support-based hospitals represent the most definitive medical care available within the AHS. ELIGIBILITY OF CARE DETERMINATION 1-48. During unified land operations, one of the most pressing questions is who is eligible for care in a United States Army-established MTF and the extent of care authorized. Numerous categories of personnel seek care in U.S. facilities that are located in austere areas where the host-nation civilian medical infrastructure is not sufficient to provide adequate care. A determination of eligibility and whether reimbursement for services is required is made at the highest level possible and in consultation with the supporting staff judge advocate. Additionally, Department of State and other military staff sections (such as the assistant chief of staff, CA) may also need to be involved in the determination process. Each operation is unique and the authorization for care is based on the appropriate U.S. and international law and policies. Other factors impacting on the determination of eligibility are command guidance, practical humanitarian and medical ethics considerations, availability of U.S. medical assets (in relationship to the threat faced by the force), and the potential training opportunities for medical forces. The sample format provided in Table 1-2 on page 1-15 is just one approach to delineate and disseminate this information to MTF personnel and may not be all-inclusive based on specific scenarios. Note. The examples for the authority to provide treatment are only illustrative in nature and should not be used as the basis for providing or denying medical care. KNOWLEDGE OF HEALTH CARE CAPABILITIES 1-49. The MTF staff must be familiar with the medical care available in the operational area from other sources. These sources could include unified action partners such as multinational force military (tactical and strategic), nongovernmental organizations or intergovernmental organizations (such as the United Nations), and local civilian resources. When appropriate, and by knowing the level and types of care available, the MTF staff can plan for the continued care of the patient after initial stabilization is provided in the United States Army MTF and the patient can be transferred to another facility for continued care. DISSEMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR CARE INFORMATION 1-50. It is essential that eligibility for medical care guidance is disseminated and understood by the chain of command and all civilians and military members of the deployed force. The AHS commander must be able Chapter 1 1-14 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 to articulate the basic principles for medical eligibility determinations. This means that he will need to condense them into simple, easily understood instructions, and widely disseminate them through electronic means or other media (such as pocket-sized cards). As the chief planner for medical support operations, the AHS commander must ensure that this information is contained in appropriate OPLANs and OPORDs and briefed to the appropriate senior leadership of the command. DOCUMENTATION 1-51. Basic documents required for determining eligibility of beneficiaries include Army Regulation (AR) 40-400; FM 6-27/MCTP 11-10C; relevant sections of Title 10, United States Code; relevant DODD and DODI; multinational force compatibility agreements; acquisition and cross-servicing agreements; orders from higher headquarters; interagency agreements (memorandums of understanding and memorandums of agreement); status of forces agreements; and appropriate unified action partners guidance for the specific operation. If contractor personnel are present, a copy of the relevant sections of their contracts should be on file to delineate specific medical services to be rendered. Additionally, for contract personnel, points of contact for the contracting company, and for the administration of the contract should be maintained. Finally, the political-military environment of the operational area must be taken into account as the medical command and control headquarters and its higher headquarters develop the eligibility matrix. 1-52. The eligibility matrix should be as comprehensive as possible. If necessary, it should include eligibility determination by name (see example in Table 1-2 on page 1-15). If individuals arrive at the emergency medical service section of the MTF who are not included in the medical/dental support matrix, the MTF must always stabilize the individual first and then determine the patient’s eligibility for continued care. The command point of contact for eligibility determinations should be contacted immediately. Further, care will be provided in accordance with the standard operating procedure (SOP) pending eligibility determination. For example, a host-nation civilian presents himself at the gate and requests medical treatment. Although on the surface it may appear that he is not eligible for care, this determination can only be made after a medical assessment is completed by competent medical personnel. In some cases, the individual may have to be brought into the MTF to accomplish an adequate medical assessment. Conducting a medical assessment does not obligate the U.S. military to provide the full spectrum of medical care. Although it does obligate the MTF to provide immediate stabilization for life-, limb-, and eyesight-threatening medical conditions and to prepare the patient for evacuation to the appropriate civilian or national contingent MTF when the patient’s medical condition permits. Note. Any individual requesting medical care should receive a timely medical assessment of his condition. Even though the individual is not eligible for treatment, life-, limb-, or eyesight-saving procedures warranted by the individual’s medical condition are provided to stabilize the individual for transfer to the appropriate civilian or other nation MTF.

HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 1-54. Information management in support of both Army and Joint health services includes the ability to identify, capture, organize, disseminate, and synthesize required operational health and medical force information in support of a commander’s plans, operations, and sustainment activities within the OA. Deploying units are required to begin using Joint Operational Medicine Information Systems (JOMIS) and other available medical information systems within 24 hours of the unit’s initial operating capability. Information systems deployed in the operational environment are required to adopt and use data exchange standards that are appropriate to, and facilitate interoperability with systems that are used in that domain. 1-55. There are two critical success factor to ensure units are utilizing their assigned systems with 24 hours of initial operating capability. The first is to introduce health information technology planning, to include network design, into the early stages of the military decision making process following receipt of an OPORD. The second is ensuring collaboration among primary staff section leaders and that the S6/Health Information Systems Officer is working with, and guiding, the chief of clinical operations, medical logistics, patient administration and operations as it relates to health information technology and communications.

United States 1-57. Health information technology in support of the AHS will continue to transform and include a deployable version of MHS GENESIS (the new electronic health record for Role 3/4 military treatment facilities) designated as JOMIS Increment 1. Other changes will include moving AHS applications to a cloud based platform and increased use of the JOMIS Mobile Computing Capability (MCC). The following are the primary systems used to support the AHS in the AO:  Electronic TCCC- Standard Form (SF) 600 (Chronological Record of Medical Care) and medical references such as the Algorithm Directed Troop Medical Care Manual are available on the JOMIS MCC platform. The MCC is currently available as an Android device and is intended for the combat medic and first responders that are typically operating in a disconnected environment. The data stored on the device can be transferred to any computing device with access to the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application-Theater (AHLTA-T).  The AHLTA-T is the operational medicine version of the current AHLTA application utilized in all MTFs to provide clinicians a system to document health care delivery to include the diagnosis and treatment of Service members and civilians authorized by Title 10 and Status of Forces Agreements. Signed/completed medical encounters from AHLTA-T are transmitted to the Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS) before final submission into the Clinical Data Repository. Chapter 1 1-18 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Patient encounters within the Clinical Data Repository are further available to all authorized health care providers throughout the MHS regardless of location. The TMDS also transmits discrete data from each medical encounter related to public health to the Medical Situational Awareness Theater (MSAT).  The Joint Legacy Viewer application is accessible within TMDS. The Joint Legacy Viewer is a Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network web-application that provides an integrated, read-only view of Electronic Health Record data from the DOD, Veterans Affairs, and Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record eHealth Exchange partners, within a single application. The Joint Legacy Viewer also provides healthcare providers access to view pre-deployment allergy, documentation, laboratory, medication and radiology records.  Theater Composite Health Care System Cache (TC2) is used to register and admit patients, order pharmacy, laboratory and imaging studies (includes computed tomography, digital radiology, magnetic resonance imagining, and ultra-sound) and document laboratory and imaging results. Similar to AHLTA-T, signed/completed TC2 encounters are transmitted to TMDS.  The TMDS is a web-based portal that offers health care delivery professionals several capabilities to include:  Viewing signed encounters from other locations and points of care.  Managing theater blood inventories.  Access to Service member life-time medical records through the Joint Legacy Viewer.  The MSAT is web-based portal that aggregates information from multiple sources to provide a joint medical common operational picture. The MSAT contains 2 distinct features:  The first aggregates clinical data from AHLTA-T and TC2 and uses a complex algorithm to identify situations involving public health, CBRN issues and exposures.  The second is a unit readiness report providing information related to a variety of information to personnel, equipment and the overall operating status of medical units such as bed status.  Medical References are available with the Medical Computing Capability application on Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care issued handhelds. The medical reference application is also available on Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care laptops and serves as the medical reference tool that provides a series of medical guides to assist the provider while performing a clinical diagnosis. The medical reference application provides access to a collection of databases with disease, drug, acute care, and toxicology information.  Defense Medical Logistics – Enterprise Systems is the program and portfolio name for all MEDLOG applications. LogiCole is the name for the refreshed Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) environment that integrates all the legacy MEDLOG applications to include DMLSS, theater electronic warehouse logistics system, joint medical asset repository and the DMLSS Customer Assistance Module into web-based environment. The DMLSS is used throughout all CONUS and outside CONUS-based Role 4 MTFs and deployed Role 3 MTFs. The theater electronic warehouse logistics system and DMLSS Customer Assistance Module are used by all Roles 1 and 2 MTFs in both combatant command (command authority) (COCOM) and U.S.
Army Forces Command domains to order and manage Class VIII medical supplies.  The DMLSS Customer Assistance Module allows tactical units to interface with LogiCole, the Defense Medical Logistics enterprise system used by theater medical supply support activities to—  Submit medical supply orders and download catalog data, stock availability, order status, and quality control alerts.  Enable these unit to manage their medical supply levels and generate orders while disconnected for submission when Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network communications are available.  Personnel can easily access an online nonsecure web-based portal clinical decision support tool. This tool is for travel medicine practitioners that provides medical professionals access to medical information to prepare Soldiers and travelers for health threats and other concerns related to international travel. This online tool supplements DOD medical information with data integrated from international and regional health organizations plus additional information and analysis Army Health System Overview 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 1-19 developed collaboratively through a network of trusted medical advisors. This information is also integrated in MSAT. For more information, go to www.travax.com.  The U.S. Transportation Command Regulating and Command and Control Evacuation System (TRAC2ES) is a web-based portal that provides patient movement and in-transit visibility to medical facilities. The TRAC2ES combines transportation, logistics and clinical decision elements in order to support tactical and strategic operations. 1-58. Department of Defense policy requires the Services to document exposures and manage health risks during all phases of military operations. The Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System (DOEHRS) - Industrial Hygiene (IH) is a DOD application funded by the MHS. It is the DOD system of records used to manage unclassified OEH data, including selected veterinary PH data, for garrison and deployment operations. The DOEHRS-IH is also the DOD's system of records for informing OEH risk management, as well as a foundational system for the individual longitudinal exposure record. It contains seven business areas-Industrial Hygiene, Environmental Health, Food Protection, Radiation, Incident Reporting, Registries, and Digital Library-and includes a module for filtering and reporting data from these areas. The DOEHRS-IH is a common access card-enabled, web-based system available at https://doehrs- ih.csd.disa.mil/. SECTION V — GLOBAL HEALTH ENGAGEMENT 1-59. Department of Defense Instruction 2000.30 instructs the DOD to conduct global health engagement activities in support of U.S. national security policy and defense cooperation strategy. The U.S. government will use the full spectrum of DOD health capabilities to execute and support—  Force Health Protection (DODD 6200.04).  Foreign Humanitarian Assistance (JP 3-29).  Foreign Disaster Relief (DODD 5100.46).  Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (DODI 2205.02).  DOD Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Policy (DODD 2060.02).  Stability Operations (DODD 3000.05).  DOD Veterinary Public and Animal Health Services (DODD 6400.04E).  DOD Policy and Responsibilities Relating to Security Cooperation (DODD 5132.03). 1-60. These health capabilities will be leveraged in military-to-military, military-to-civilian, or multilateral global health engagement activities as tools to—  Promote and enhance partner nation’s stability and security.  Develop military and civilian partner nation capacity.  Build trust, confidence, and resilience.  Share information.  Coordinate mutual activities.  Maintain influence to enable implementation of the guidance for the employment of the force and to support the achievement of U.S. government national security objectives.  Enhance DOD’s awareness of global health engagement and improve its relationship and interoperability with each partner nation to achieve security cooperation objectives.  Seek to develop and improve the human and animal health capabilities and capacities of DOD and partner nation personnel. This page intentionally left blank. 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-1 Chapter 2 Army Health System Command and Control The complexities of the competition continuum, the myriad of medical functions and assets, and the requirement to provide health care across unified land operations to diverse populations (U.S., joint, multinational, host nation, and civilian) necessitate a medical command authority that is regionally focused and capable of utilizing the scarce medical resources available to their full potential and capacity. Each of the medical command organizations (medical command [deployment support] [MEDCOM (DS)], medical brigade [support] [MEDBDE (SPT)], and medical battalion [multifunctional] [MMB]) is designed to provide scalable and tailorable command posts for early entry and expeditionary operations which could be expanded and augmented as the operational area matures and an Army and joint integrated health care infrastructure is established. The AHS command and control consists of both formal medical command organizations and the surgeon’s technical supervision at echelon of medical assets. SECTION I — OVERVIEW OF ARMY ECHELONS 2-1. To ensure a seamless continuum of care from the POI or wounding to the CONUS-support base exists, and in order to decrease morbidity and mortality and to reduce disability, a synergistic effort is required between AHS table of organization and equipment (TOE) (operational forces) and table of distribution and allowances (the institutional force) organizations and resources and those found in other sectors of the CONUS-support base. The ability of the deployed medical commander to reach into the CONUS-support base for medical, technical, clinical, and materiel support is paramount to optimizing the medical outcomes of our Soldiers who become wounded, injured, or ill while on deployments. This reachback capability enhances the care given and maximizes the utilization and employment of scarce medical resources. OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT 2-2. The future operational environment and our forces’ challenges to operate across the competition continuum represents the most significant readiness requirement. The logic chart (Figure 2-1 on page 2-2) depicted on the next page begins with an anticipated OE that includes considerations during LSCO against a peer threat. It depicts the Army's contribution to joint operations through the Army’s strategic roles. Within each phase of a joint operation, the Army's operational concept of unified land operations guides how Army forces conduct operations. In unified land operations, Army forces combine offensive, defensive, and stability tasks to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative in order to shape OEs, prevent conflict, conduct large- scale ground combat operations, and consolidate gains. Mission command guides commanders, staffs, and subordinates in their approach to command and control. The command and control warfighting function enables commanders and staffs of theater armies, corps, divisions, and brigade combat teams to synchronize and integrate combat power across multiple domains and the information environment. Throughout operations, Army forces maneuver to achieve and exploit positions of relative advantage across all domains to achieve objectives and accomplish missions. 2-3. The logic chart (Figure 2-1 on page 2-2) depicts how the AHS supports the operating force. The AHS support logic chart is aligned with ADP 3-0, FM 3-0, ADP 3-37, ADP 4-0, FM 4-0, and JP 4-02. 2-4. For more information on AHS support to the Army strategic roles, refer to Appendix A. Chapter 2 2-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Figure 2-1. Army Health System support logic chart Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-3 ARMY COMMAND AND SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS 2-5. Army command and support relationships are similar but not identical to joint command authorities and relationships. Differences stem from the way Army forces task-organize internally and the need for a system of support relationships between Army forces. Another important difference is the requirement for Army commanders to handle the administrative support requirements that meet the needs of Soldiers. These differences allow for flexible allocation of Army capabilities within various Army echelons. Army command and support relationships are the basis for building Army task organizations.Certain responsibilities are inherent in the Army's command and support relationships. For more information on command relationships for joint force, refer to JP 3-0. ARMY COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS 2-6. Commanders recognize that effectiveness is built on mutual trust and confidence between superior, subordinate, supporting and supported organizations. This trust and confidence is developed through relationships. Generally the longer a relationship lasts, a greater degree of trust and confidence results. Between organizations that have had long-term habitual relationships, authorities and responsibilities are typically well known. For more information regarding mission command and command and control of Army forces, refer to ADP 6-0 and FM 6-0. 2-7. Army command relationships define superior and subordinate relationships between unit commanders. By specifying a chain of command, command relationships unify effort and enable commanders to use subordinate forces with maximum flexibility. Army command relationships identify the degree of control of the gaining Army commander. The type of command relationship often relates to the expected longevity of the relationship between the headquarters involved, and it quickly identifies the degree of support that the gaining and losing Army commanders provide. The five Army command relationships include:  Organic.  Assigned.  Attached.  Operational Control (OPCON).  Tactical control (TACON). 2-8. See Appendix B for more information regarding Army command relationships according to FM 3-0 and FM 4-0. ARMY SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS 2-9. Army support relationships are not a command authority and are more specific than joint support relationships. Commanders establish support relationships when subordination of one unit to another is inappropriate. Army support relationships are:  Direct support.  General support.  Reinforcing.  General support-reinforcing. 2-10. Refer to Appendix B for more information on Army support relationships according to FM 3-0 and FM 4-0. 2-11. See Figure 2-2 on page 2-4 for an example of AHS organizations’ command and support relationships during an operation or when deployed. Refer to Appendix C for more information on the synchronization, coordination, and integration of medical support at echelon between medical and sustainment (FM 4-0), protection, and other warfighting functions/staff cells. Chapter 2 2-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Figure 2-2. Army Health System command and support relationships THEATER ARMY 2-12. The theater army is the senior Army headquarters in an AOR, and it consists of the commander, staff, and all Army forces assigned to a combatant command. Each theater army has operational and administrative responsibilities. Its operational responsibilities include command of forces, direction of operations, and control of assigned AOs. Its administrative responsibilities encompass the Service-specific requirements for equipping, sustaining, training, unit readiness, discipline, and personnel matters. As required, the theater army provides Army support to other services and common user logistics. 2-13. The theater army always maintains an AOR-wide focus, providing support to Army and joint forces across the AOR, in accordance with the geographic combatant commander (GCC)'s priorities of support. For example, the theater army continues shape and prevent activities in various operational areas at the same time it is LSCO. 2-14. The theater army serves as the Army Service component command (ASCC) of the geographic combatant command. It is organized, manned, and equipped to perform that role. The ASCC is the command responsible for recommendations to the joint force commander (JFC) on the allocation and employment of Army forces within a CCDR’s AOR. For additional information refer to FM 3-94. 2-15. According to ATP 3-93 (Theater Army Operations), theater armies are assigned or provided access to five enabling capabilities (sustainment, signal, medical, military intelligence, and civil affairs), and an assortment of functional and multifunctional units, based on specific requirements for the area of responsibility. 2-16. The MEDCOM (DS) is assigned to the ASCC. As one of the theater enabling commands, the MEDCOM (DS) is the theater medical command responsible for integration, synchronization, and command and control for the execution of all AHS support operations within the AOR. The MEDCOM (DS) may have a direct support or general support relationship with the corps or the division. The MEDCOM (DS) has a command relationship with the ASCC and a general support relationship with the theater sustainment command (TSC) or expeditionary sustainment command (ESC). A high level of coordination between command and staff channels develops the situational understanding necessary to recommend priorities and courses of action to echelon commanders. The medical staff channels (surgeon cells) conduct planning, Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-5 coordination, synchronization, and integration of AHS support to plans. Refer to Appendix C for detailed discussion regarding the coordination, synchronization, and integration of medical support at echelons. The chain of medical commanders execute the AHS support to OPLANs, and maintain the medical technical channel throughout echelons. THEATER ARMY SURGEON'S SECTION 2-17. The ASCC surgeon is the theater army staff proponent responsible for (in coordination with the MEDCOM [DS] commander) the provision of AHS support within the AOR. The ASCC surgeon has staff responsibility for medical planning, coordination, and policy development for AHS support to deployed forces. This officer advises the ASCC commander concerning the health of the command, recommends changes to the theater evacuation policy, and provides input to and personnel in support of the theater patient movement requirements center, as required. Organizations from battalion through ASCC level are authorized a surgeon. The Army Medicine leverages the chain of surgeon's cells (staff channels) and medical command channels (through the MEDCOM [DS], medical brigade [support], and medical battalion [multifunctional] to provide AHS support to the deployed force. Integration of these two chains and other elements of sustainment occur at command headquarters at echelon and not just between sustainment organizations. 2-18. The ASCC surgeon and the surgeon cells at each echelon identify, assess, counter and/or mitigate health threats across the competition continuum. They advise commanders on medical capabilities and capacities necessary to support plans, and interface with logistical, financial management, and personnel elements to coordinate AHS support across the warfighting functions. The ASCC surgeon and the surgeon cells at each echelon (including the TSC, ESC, and sustainment brigade surgeon cells) work with their staff to conduct planning, coordination, synchronization, and integration of AHS support to plans to ensure that all 10 medical functions are considered and included in running estimates, OPLANS, and OPORD in coordination with the MEDCOM (DS). Refer to Appendix C for more information on the synchronization and integration of AHS support at echelon. 2-19. The MEDCOM (DS) commander is responsible for maintaining a regional focus in support of the GCC and ASCC theater engagement plan, while providing effective and timely direct FHP and HSS to tactical commanders and general support (on an area basis) to  theater forces at EAB. The enduring regional focus of the ASCC drives organizational specialization in the supporting MEDCOM (DS) to address unique health threats, specific needs of the local populace, availability of other Service medical capabilities, and geographic factors that are distinctly related to a particular region. The MEDCOM (DS) coordinates with the ASCC surgeon (as the staff proponent with execution through G-3 channels under the authority of the ASCC commander) to provide AHS support within the AOR. 2-20. As the theater medical command, the MEDCOM (DS) integrates, synchronizes, and provides command and control of MEDBDE (SPT), MMBs, and other AHS units providing force health protection and health service support to tactical commanders. The MEDCOM (DS) employs an operational command post (CP) and a main CP that can deploy autonomously into an operational area and is employed based on the size and complexity of operations or the support required. Refer to Figure 2-3 on page 2-6 for an overview of a theater medical structure. Key tasks of a MEDCOM (DS) in support of the ASCC include:  Providing command and control of MEDBDE (SPT) and subordinate medical units assigned and attached.  Task-organizing medical elements based on specific medical requirements.  Monitoring health threats within each operational area and ensuring the availability of required medical capabilities to mitigate those threats. Chapter 2 2-6 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Figure 2-3. Medical structure in theater THEATER SUSTAINMENT COMMAND 2-21. The TSC is the Army’s command for the integration and synchronization of sustainment in the AOR. The TSC connects strategic enablers to the tactical formations. It is a theater-committed asset to each ASCC and focuses on Title 10 support of Army forces for theater security cooperation and the CCDRs daily operational requirements. The TSC commands assigned human resources sustainment centers and Financial Management Support Centers. The TSC commander also commands and task organizes attached ESCs, sustainment brigades, and additional sustainment units. The TSC executes the sustainment concept of support for planning and executing sustainment-related support to the AOR for all the Army strategic roles (shape OEs, prevent conflict, prevail in large-scale ground combat, and consolidate gains). 2-22. The TSCs execute sustainment operations through their assigned and attached units. The TSC integrates and synchronizes sustainment operations across an AOR from a home station command and control center or through a deployed CP. The TSC has four operational responsibilities to forces in theater: theater opening, theater distribution, sustainment and theater closing. 2-23. The task-organized TSC is tailored to provide operational-level sustainment support within an assigned AOR. It integrates and synchronizes sustainment operations for an ASCC including all Army forces forward- stationed, transiting, or operating within the AOR. The TSC coordinates Title 10, Army support to other Services, DOD executive agent (EA), and lead service responsibilities across the entire theater. 2-24. The TSC organizes forces, establishes command relationships and allocates resources as necessary to support mission requirements, and exercises command and control over attached sustainment forces. The TSC supports the ASCC sustainment cells with planning and coordinating theater-wide sustainment. The execution of sustainment is decentralized, performed by the human resources sustainment centers, Financial Management Support Centers, ESCs, sustainment brigades, and other sustainment organizations. The Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-7 medical logistics management center (MLMC) forward team collocates with the distribution management center (DMC) of the TSC or ESC to serve as the liaison to the MEDCOM (DS). The MEDCOM (DS) is responsible for integrating and executing medical operations. The DMC is the principal staff section for coordinating sustainment across an operational area. It is headed by the support operations officer and is a coordinating staff section unique to TSCs and ESCs. The DMC is responsible for sustaining the force in accordance with the theater army priorities. The staff focuses on detailed planning for operational area opening, distribution, sustainment, and operational area closing operations. See ATP 4-94 for additional information. ARMY MEDICAL SUPPORT TO OTHER SERVICES 2-25. The Surgeon General is the principal military adviser to the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army on the health and medical aspects of manning, training, and equipping the Army as in Title 10 United States Code. In this role, The Surgeon General serves as the Headquarters, Department of the Army medical integrator and synchronizer with expert oversight for material development for assigned programs and responsible for medical research, development and acquisition functions. United States Army medical forces provide AHS support to the joint force through oversight and assigned DOD EA or lead Service responsibilities for a number of medical functions. This requires the synchronization and integration of operational medical resources across the unified action partners to meet CCDR’s global mission objectives. The Surgeon General’s EA or lead Service responsibilities include:  Serves as the DOD EA for medical research for prevention, mitigation, and treatment of blast injuries.  Coordinates for joint patient movement across the joint force.  Provides intratheater aeromedical evacuation (includes medical evacuation from ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship for United States Navy and Marine personnel).  Coordinates for medical support to joint special operations forces. See ATP 4-02.43 for additional information. 2-26. The MEDCOM (DS), MEDBDE (SPT), and subordinate units are responsible to the ASCC commander (through coordination with the ASCC surgeon) for regionally focused execution and oversight of AHS support to other Services within the AO. When designated, the MEDCOM (DS) is also responsible for providing operational medical logistics support to other Services. In cases where the ASCC is designated by the CCDR as the single integrated medical logistics manager (SIMLM), these functions are most commonly executed under the direction of the MEDCOM (DS) in coordination with the ASCC surgeon, the TSC, and the supported service components. 2-27. For the Class VIII single integrated medical logistics manager mission, the MLMC provides information management and distribution coordination; the medical logistics company provides medical supply and medical maintenance support; the MEDBDE (SPT) provides planning and supervision; and the MEDCOM (DS) provides theater-level oversight of MEDLOG operations. The medical detachment (blood support) provides collection, manufacturing, storage, and distribution of blood and blood products for brigade and echelons above brigade AHS units and other Services as required. The MEDCOM (DS) maintains a command link with the MEDBDE (SPT) and coordination link with the TSC and/or ESC through the MLMC (forward team) collocated with the DMC. HEALTH CARE AND THE COMMAND SURGEON IN JOINT OPERATIONS 2-28. The AHS is a strategic enabler of joint medical operations and provides the only standing theater- level medical command and control within the DOD. In joint operations, each Service operates its own health care delivery system, however, health care facilities, medical equipment, supplies, and personnel may be provided on a joint basis, when directed by the joint force commander. Although joint staffing is not a requisite to joint use, staff augmentation from Service components may be required. When one Service uses personnel or medical elements from another Service, the borrowing Service assumes operational control over those elements, however, administrative responsibility remains with the lending Service. 2-29. Upon activation of a joint task force, a command surgeon is designated from one of the component Services. Joint Publication 4-02 states that a joint force surgeon should normally be appointed for each Chapter 2 2-8 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 combatant command, subordinate unified command, and joint task force. As a specialty advisor, the joint force surgeon reports directly to the joint force commander or the joint force land component commander. The joint force surgeon coordinates medical matters for the joint force commander. The joint force surgeon’s staff should be jointly manned (when possible) and should be of sufficient size to effectively facilitate joint coordination of medical initiatives; review of plans; and integration with overall operations. The command surgeon must assess component forces medical requirements and capabilities and provide guidance to enhance effectiveness of health care through shared use of assets. Refer to JP 4-02 for additional information on the duties and responsibilities of the joint force surgeon. 2-30. Liaison must be established between the joint force surgeon and each Service component command surgeon to ensure that mutual understanding of medical capabilities and procedures, unity of purpose and action, and joint health care is maintained. UNIFIED ACTION PARTNERS 2-31. In the OE, a unity of effort must be achieved by all participants and in many scenarios the AHS will provide responsive medical care to unified action partners within the operations determination of eligibility for care. Likewise, our unified action partners may provide first responder and health care services for U.S.
troops engaged in multinational operations.The synchronization with our unified action partners of all health care delivery to U.S. Soldiers and multinational forces is essential to ensure the appropriate medical resources are available when needed in the OE. SECTION II — MEDICAL COMMAND AND CONTROL ORGANIZATIONS 2-32. The AHS is a foundational capability that supports the CCDR’s efforts to prevent conflict and shape OEs. The Army medical forces participate in expeditionary operations, integrate with other Services, and support unified action partners. Leaders must understand that the Army Health System medical functions are complex in nature and that medical command and control of FHP and HSS support require integration, coordination, and synchronization to ensure the interoperability of all medical assets remain in balance to optimize the effective functioning of the entire system. 2-33. The medical command and control function includes the centralized medical chain of command that provides command and control of EAB medical assets. Most importantly, it also includes the surgeon’s technical supervision at echelon of assigned or attached medical assets. 2-34. All command and control headquarters perform the same basic military tasks. According to ADP 6-0, command and control is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Medical command and control is not just the exercise of command and control over assigned or attached medical units. It is an overarching function including the technical, clinical, and medical control of all FHP and HSS support. A key to the successful accomplishment of the AHS support is the synchronization of health care activities and the surgeon’s technical supervision at echelon of ongoing medical and clinical operations. For more detailed information refer to Appendix C.  Specific medical command and control tasks are addressed in Table 2-1 on page 2-9. Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-9 Table 2-1. Primary tasks and purposes of the medical command and control function Primary task Purpose Command forces Ensure unity of Army Health System support effort. Train subordinates on command and control and the application of mission command. Make timely and effective Army Health System support decisions and act. Inform and influence leaders to provide the right mix of medical capabilities. Control operations Regulate the Army Health Service support of subordinate and supporting units. Direct and coordinate the actions of medical assets to meet commander’s intent. Ensure the medical functions within the protection and sustainment warfighting functions are coordinated and synchronized for linkage between these varied commands and staffs. Direct actions by establishing responsibilities and limits that prevent subordinate medical unit actions from impeding one another. Maintain situational understanding of Army Health Services command and control systems and the common operational picture. Drive the operations process Employ the operations process to integrate and synchronize the force health protection and health service support medical functions. Integrate numerous processes such as intelligence preparation of the battlefield, medical intelligence, and the military decision-making process. Ensure execution of Army Health System support supports the CCDR's decisions and intent. Establish the command and control system Support the commander’s decision making. Prepare and communicate directives to subordinate and supporting medical units. Facilitate the integration of medical information systems in support of Army Health System. Provide technical supervision Advise the commander on the health of the command and how best to provide Army Health System support for commander’s freedom of movement. Ensure medical standards are established, implemented, and monitored throughout the operational area. Advise commanders on implementation of protective action posture including chemoprophylaxis, restriction of movement, isolation, and quarantine to prevent and control the spread of diseases. Provide consultation and support to subordinate medical units or elements. Provide reachback capability to the Defense Health Agency (DHA) continental United States-support base medical treatment facilities in the areas of various medical disciplines and specialties. Provide oversight over medical care to Soldiers, civilians, and detainees. For a more detailed discussion on command and control, refer to ADP 3-0, ADP 5-0, and ADP 6-0. Chapter 2 2-10 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 MEDICAL COMMAND (DEPLOYMENT SUPPORT) 2-35. The MEDCOM (DS) conserves the fighting strength of the operational commander through integration, synchronization of AHS operations and providing command and control of MEDBDE (SPT), MMBs, and/or other AHS units assigned/attached to the headquarters providing HSS or FHP to operational commanders and AO forces while simultaneously conducting stability tasks. MISSION, ASSIGNMENT, AND BASIS OF ALLOCATION 2-36. The MEDCOM (DS) serves as the theater medical command within the AO. The MEDCOM (DS) commander identifies and evaluates health care requirements throughout the AO. Within the MEDCOM (DS) AO, medical resources may be dispersed over an extended area and may include numerous areas with increased patient densities, transient troop populations, varying levels of hostilities, and significantly different health care requirements. To successfully execute medical operations, the MEDCOM (DS) commander must have the ability to rapidly task-organize and reallocate medical assets across command and geographical boundaries. This ability is crucial to ensure the medical force package is effectively tailored to optimize the use of scarce medical resources. 2-37. The MEDCOM (DS) is composed of an operational command post (OCP) and a main command post (MCP) that can deploy autonomously into the AO.  The OCP is a deployable and versatile module. The OCP can conduct early entry operations and serves as the forward command and control element of the MEDCOM (DS). The OCP expand the reach of the MEDCOM (DS) to provide connectivity between the headquarters and headquarters company, MEDCOM (DS) in CONUS and/or deployed home station and the medical units in the AO. It—  Provides command and control, administrative assistance and technical supervision of assigned or attached medical units.  Can deploy autonomously into the AO during early entry and theater opening operations. Further, the OCP can be deployed to other AOs outside its habitually supported theater to provide medical command and control in support of another operation.  Provides interface and liaison with supported forces in the AO. The OCP has an assigned standard requirements code to facilitate the placement of personnel in the command post and to integrate the command post into the Time Phased Force Deployment List.  Can be incrementally expanded or be augmented as the force builds within the AO.  Builds the structure required to provide campaign-quality health care to the deployed force.  The MCP provides appropriate staff sections for command, control, and support to assigned or attached units in the theater of operation. The MCP can be deployed to expand or enhance the Operational Command Post or remain in a sanctuary as the primary command and control medical element of the HHC, MEDCOM (DS). The MCP provides connectivity between CONUS and medical units in the theater. If the OCP is deployed and needs additional personnel or clinical skills, the MCP can deploy personnel to the OCP to provide more robust command and control capabilities. The MCP provides a robust planning, controlling, and coordinating capability to facilitate the provision of health care to expanding forces. The MEDCOM (DS) MCP provides—  Medical staff planning, operational and technical supervision, and administrative assistance for subordinate units operating in the AO.  Increased capability for medical and surgical consultation services, technical advice, and policy development in the areas of hospitalization, nursing services, pharmacy, optometry, medical laboratory, dental services, COSC, behavioral health, and neuropsychiatric services, veterinary services (zoonotic disease control, investigation and inspection of subsistence, and animal medicine), nutrition care, and operational public health (entomology, epidemiology, occupational and environmental health (OEH) surveillance, potable water inspection, pest management, food facility inspection, and control of medical and nonmedical waste). 2-38. The MEDCOM (DS) possesses the authority to effectively and efficiently task-organize medical elements based on specific medical requirements. The MEDCOM (DS) serves as the theater medical Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-11 command for the AOR and focuses on medical OPLANs and medical contingency plans. It monitors threats and ensures required medical capabilities to mitigate these health threats, and maintains visibility and utilization of medical infrastructure, treatment, and evacuation capabilities. It accomplishes Title 10 responsibilities and Army support to other Services for the AO. The MEDCOM (DS) partners and trains with host-nation and multinational AHS units. It maintains a command relationship with the theater army and the CCDR to influence and improve the delivery of health care and is linked to the TSC by the MEDLOG management center for coordination and planning. The MEDCOM (DS) is assigned to the theater army and is allocated on a basis of one per theater. 2-39. Refer to Figure 2-4 for notional deployed MEDCOM (DS). Figure 2-4. Notional deployed medical command (deployment support) CAPABILITIES AND DEPENDENCIES 2-40.

This unit (its TOE and supplies) is 100 percent mobile using organic assets. 2-43. Refer to Figure 2-5 (on page 2-13) for a depiction of a MEDCOM (DS) organizational structure. REGIONAL FOCUS 2-44. The MEDCOM (DS) maintains a regional focus that encompasses all of the CCDR’s AOR. As in all regions of the world, neighboring countries often have economic, social, and religious ties and deal with similar health issues. The issues which may be at the heart of the social unrest in the deployment area can usually be found to exist in the other countries within the same region. Medical forces, due to their humanitarian mission, are more acceptable to host nations than the operational Army. The medical commander’s ability to cultivate medical professional contacts within a nation or group of nations, facilitates the planning for and execution of regional strategies that will potentially mitigate the underlying social, economic, cultural, health, and political conditions which can foster civil unrest. 2-45. By establishing linkages to the civilian and governmental health care authorities in each nation, the senior medical command headquarters can actively monitor existing health threats, develop regional strategies to mitigate these threats, enhance the host-nation government’s legitimacy with the affected population, and reduce human suffering. The medical commander provides the CCDR with an effective tool to assist in shaping the security environment by mitigating the adverse health conditions that impact the development of strong social, economic, and political infrastructures. The CCDR can deploy medical experts to provide consultation, training support, and advice to assist host nations in broadening their medical capacity in both the public and private health sectors through the development and implementation of health care programs specifically designed to address the particular health challenges faced by the host nation. Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-13 Figure 2-5. Medical Command (deployment support) organizational structure 2-46. Military medical training exercises can be mutually beneficial to the host nation and U.S. forces. These exercises provide a forum for training medical personnel in the identification and treatment of diseases and conditions that are not endemic in the U.S. and provide the host-nation military or civilian medical personnel training on emerging state-of-the-art technologies and medical protocols. The care provided which is incidental to the training mission, assists the host nation in overcoming the adverse impacts of the diseases/conditions treated and enhances its legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens. 2-47. The effects of focusing on interregional cooperation are to eradicate diseases or the environmental conditions that promote the growth of disease vectors. The interregional cooperation which results may also favorably affect the economic, social, and political fabric of the nation, remove obstacles to interregional cooperation in other sectors, and enhance the standard of living of the host-nation residents.

CAPABILITIES AND DEPENDENCIES 2-123. The MMB headquarters is composed of two standard requirements code identified modules (the early entry element and the campaign support element) to facilitate the deployment and integration of the unit on the time-phased force deployment list. This headquarters conducts operational planning for assigned and attached medical functional companies, detachments, and teams. The early entry element can be deployed independently or task-organized with a CSH or hospital center as a medical multifunctional task force. The MMB headquarters should only be deployed as far forward as the division AO. Even in this circumstance, the MMB would remain under the direct command and control of the MEDBDE (SPT) and not directly attached to the BCT. Detachments and teams assigned or attached to the MMB may be further attached to the brigade support medical company to augment or reconstitute BCT medical elements. The array of health care units assigned and attached will vary depending upon mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations factors. The MMB staff structure is depicted in Figure 2-12. Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-33 Figure 2-12. Medical battalion (multifunctional) staff structure STAFF ORGANIZATIONS AND FUNCTIONS 2-124. This section discusses staff organizations and functions in MMB. Internal Staff and Operations 2-125. The MMB’s coordinating staff and special staff sections manage the command’s internal operations through coordination with staffs of higher, lower, and adjacent units. The staff’s efforts support the commander and subordinate units. The staff supports the commander by providing accurate and timely information. It produces estimates, recommendations, plans and orders, and monitors execution. The staff streamlines cumbersome or time-consuming procedures by ensuring that all activities contribute to mission accomplishment. Within the MMB headquarters, staff sections coordinate their areas of interest with other headquarters staff sections as required. Battalion Command Section 2-126. The battalion command section provides command and control and administrative services for assigned and attached medical companies and detachments. S-1 Section 2-127.

Develops, recommends, and submits priority information requests and essential elements of friendly information for information impacting clinical operations (to include the potential enemy use of CBRN weaponry and toxic industrial materials releases). This includes health threats and potential diseases present in the AO and the health status of enemy forces who may become detained personnel (to include new or exotic diseases in enemy forces).  Operational, planning, and medical regulating support. This section monitors current operations and assists in planning future operations by developing and coordinating estimates and plans. They must evaluate proposed courses of action for their impact on MMB capabilities and activities and recommend whether they are feasible. Further, they must closely monitor medical regulating activities delays in the timely evacuation of patients to and from MMB MTFs. The FHP operations section recommends clinical and operational capabilities (task-organized) required to be deployed forward to support MMB personnel deployed to the BCT or to areas within the EAB to provide direct support.  S-4 for MEDLOG support of critical Class VIII items required for patient care, to include medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and blood. The FHP operations section monitors the blood distribution and reporting processes (TM 8-227-12) to determine the impact on medical company (area support) clinical operations of shortages and delays. Further, they monitor the status of medical supplies, medical equipment, and medical equipment maintenance and repair to ensure that sufficient quantities are on hand and/or on order to sustain patient care activities within the command. They also work closely with the MEDCOM (DS) and MEDBDE (SPT) logistics in identifying and obtaining pharmaceuticals to treat diseases (to include biological warfare Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-35 agents) not usually present in U.S. forces (such as for detainees). This also includes medications and medical equipment required to treat nontraditional populations, such as U.S. government contractors, geriatric, pediatric, and obstetric patients. This section also advises the command on the management and disposition of captured enemy medical supplies and equipment.  Battalion maintenance section on issues related to assigned wheeled vehicle maintenance, power- equipment maintenance, and wheeled vehicle.  S-6 on matters pertaining to connectivity, information management, automation, and communications.

This section identifies communications-electronics requirements for data transmission services and coordinates these requirements with the external signal organizations. This section provides advice and consultation on the integration of medical information systems in support of AHS and with other command and control systems within the AO. Detachment Headquarters 2-137. The detachment headquarters provides for billeting, filed feeding, discipline, security, training, and administration for Soldiers assigned to the headquarters. Chapter 2 2-36 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Unit Ministry Team 2-138. The battalion unit ministry team provides two required capabilities to the command. First, religious support and pastoral ministry for assigned or attached Service members, authorized civilians, patients, and casualties. Second, they advise on religion, morals, and morale within units, and ethical decision making of the command. The unit ministry team also supports and advises subordinate commanders and COSC units, as required. External Coordination 2-139.The MMB must coordinate externally with the MEDBDE (SPT)/MEDCOM (DS) and in early entry operations when a senior medical command headquarters is not present, with the sustainment brigade staff and other supported units to accomplish the medical mission. This coordination is conducted mainly through command surgeon channels for synchronization of the medical plan and external coordination with the combat aviation brigade for MEDEVAC. Coordinates and synchronizes the planning and execution of AHS actions. 2-140. In the performance of their AHS mission, the MMB staff may be required to coordinate with medical personnel/organizations of the other Services. For example, the USAF staff provides aeromedical liaison teams to facilitate AE aboard USAF resources. The MMB may be required to coordinate directly with CONUS for support services under control of Department of the Army (DA), DOD, and Secretary of Defense. These include depots, arsenals, data banks, plants, research laboratories, and factories associated with the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. SECTION III — MEDICAL COMMANDER, COMMAND SURGEON, AND LINE COMMANDER 2-141. The medical commander exercises command and control (authority and direction) over the subordinate medical resources. MEDICAL COMMANDER 2-142. As discussed in Army doctrine on unified land operations, the medical commander is the focus of command and control and uses two processes in the decision-making process. The commander uses an analytic approach to evaluate information and data systematically, proposes courses of action, and determines which course of action will provide the optimal results. The commander also makes decisions intuitively. For the medical commander, the intuitive decision-making process is guided by professional judgment gained from experience, knowledge, education, intelligence, and intuition. Experienced staff members use their intuitive ability to recognize the key elements and implications of a particular problem or situation, reject the impractical, and select an adequate solution. 2-143. The leader-developed medical professional has been trained in critical thinking, assessing situations, determining requirements for follow-on services, and decisive decision-making skills since the beginning of leader’s professional career. These are essential and critical skills which have been taught, nurtured, and cultivated throughout commander’s professional medical education and training. The medical commander’s experience base cannot be viewed from a purely military perspective of when the commander entered the Army, but must be viewed holistically to encompass all of the training, education, and experience this leader received. The military and leader development training, education, and experience coupled with proven critical thinking skills and ability to take decisive action make this officer the most qualified commander to determine how medical assets will be employed in support of the operational commander and to successfully accomplish Title 10 responsibilities for the care of assigned Soldiers. 2-144. The construct of mission command provides for centralized planning and decentralized execution and is driven by mission orders. Successful mission command demands that subordinate leaders at all echelons exercise disciplined initiative, aggressive action, and to independently accomplish the mission within the commander’s intent. Mission command gives the subordinate leaders at all echelons the greatest possible freedom of action. While command and control restrains higher-level commanders from micromanaging subordinates, it does not remove them from the fight. Rather, mission command frees these Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-37 commanders to focus on accomplishing their higher commander’s intent and on critical decisions only they can make. The medical command and control structure enables the MEDCOM (DS) commander to retain a regional focus in support of the CCDR and the operational area engagement plan, while still providing effective and timely direct support to the supported operational commanders and providing general support on an area basis to theater forces at EAB (such as those conducting aerial ports of debarkation, sea ports of debarkation, and operational assembly areas operations or to other temporary or permanent troop concentrations). One consequence of the enduring regional focus of the Army AO is to drive specialization in its subordinate MEDCOM (DS) since unique health threats, local needs and capabilities, other Service capabilities, and geographic factors are distinctly related to a particular region. This characteristic is in contrast to some other staff and subordinate unit functions that are performed in much the same ways regardless of region. COMMAND SURGEON 2-145. At all levels of command, a command surgeon is designated. This Army Medicine officer is a member of the commander’s personal and special staff charged with planning, coordinating, and ensuring the AHS mission is executed. At the lower levels of command, this officer may be dual-hatted as an AHS unit commander; further, the command surgeon may have a small staff section to assist in planning, coordinating, and synchronizing the AHS effort within the operational area. For detailed information regarding the surgeon and surgeon section at echelon, refer to Appendix C.
2-146. The command surgeon is responsible for ensuring that all Army Medicine functions are considered and included in running estimates, OPLANs, and OPORDs. The command surgeon retains technical supervision of all AHS operations. At the higher levels of command, the scope of duties and responsibilities expand to include all subordinate levels of command. 2-147. Through mission command, the command surgeon may be empowered to act somewhat independently; however, the nonmedical commander can retain the authority to make the decisions which he feels are critical. Mission command, to be successful, requires an environment of trust and mutual understanding which may be challenging to establish for newly assigned staff members who have not had a previous supporting relationship with the command. 2-148. The duties and responsibilities of command surgeons may include, but are not limited to:  Advising the commander on the health of the command.  Monitoring the three phases of TCCC.  Developing and coordinating the HSS and FHP portion of OPLANs to support the CCDRs decisions, planning guidance, and intent.  Preparing and developing the medical concept of support and medical common operating picture.  Determining the medical workload requirements (patient estimates) in coordination with the assistant chief of staff, personnel (the assistant chief of staff, personnel’s casualty estimate includes only those casualties that require replacements). A patient estimate refers to estimates derived from the casualty estimate prepared by the personnel staff officer/assistant chief of staff, personnel. The patient medical workload is determined by the Army Health System support planner. Patient estimate only encompasses medical casualty (ATP 4-02.55).  Determining, in conjunction with the staff judge advocate and the chain of command, the eligibility for medical care in a U.S. Army MTF.  Maintaining situational understanding.

The usage of these systems will enable theater-wide visibility in support of AHS functions and joint HSS.  Recommending MEDEVAC policies and procedures.  Monitoring medical regulating and patient tracking operations.  Determining AHS training requirements.  Developing policies, protocols, and procedures pertaining to the medical and dental treatment of sick, injured, and wounded personnel. These policies, protocols, and procedures will be in consonance with applicable regulations, directives, and instructions; higher headquarters policies; SOPs; applicable multinational force compatibility agreements; memorandums of understanding or agreement; and Status of Forces Agreements.  Ensuring patient safety, quality assurance, infection control, and risk management programs are established and implemented.  Ensuring field medical records and/or electronic medical records, when available, are maintained on each Soldier at the primary care MTF according to AR 40-66. This includes documentation of any radiological exposures and integration with U.S. Army Dosimetry Center and radiation safety officer as necessary.  Ensuring compliance with the theater blood bank service program.  Ensuring a viable veterinary program (to include inspection of subsistence and outside the continental U.S. food production and bottled water facilities, veterinary public health, and animal medical care [including establishing a military working dog (MWD) evacuation policy]) is established.  Ensuring a medical laboratory capability or procedures for obtaining this support from out of theater resources are established for the identification and confirmation and/or theater validation of the use of suspect biological warfare and chemical warfare agents by opposition forces. This also includes the capability for collecting specimens/samples, packaging, and handling requirements and escort/chain of custody requirements. For additional information on AHS support in a CBRN environment refer to Army medical doctrine.  Planning for and implementing public health operations and facilitating health risk communications (to include operational public health activities and initiating personnel protective measures to counter the health threat).  Planning for and ensuring pre- and postdeployment health assessments are accomplished.  Establishing and executing a medical surveillance program (refer to DODD 6490.02E, DODI 6490.03, and AR 40-66 for an in-depth discussion).  Establishing and executing an OEH surveillance program.  Recommending COSC, BH, and substance abuse control programs.  Coordinating for medical intelligence with the supporting intelligence officer, section, and unit. Refer to Appendix D for more information on medical intelligence. Pursuing other avenues to obtain medical intelligence and/or medical information such as the—  National Center for Medical Intelligence.  Army Public Health Center.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  United States Public Health Services.  The Office of The Surgeon General, Intelligence and Security Division.  Intergovernmental organizations (such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, or the Pan American Health Organization, and other nongovernmental organizations).  Information gathered from MSAT, site visits to host-nation medical facilities. Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-39  Identifying commander’s critical information requirements, priority intelligence requirements, essential elements of friendly information, and friendly forces information requirements as they pertain to the health threat; ensuring they are incorporated into the command’s intelligence requirements.  Coordinating for foreign humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and medical response to weapons of mass destruction or terrorist incidents, and defense support of civil authorities, when authorized.  Advising commanders on AHS CBRN defensive actions (such as immunizations, use of chemoprophylaxis, pretreatments, and barrier creams).  Ensuring individual informed consent is established before the administration of investigational new drugs as described in AR 40-7.  Assessing special equipment and procedures required to accomplish the AHS mission in specific environments such as urban operations, mountainous terrain, extreme cold weather operations, jungles, and deserts. Requirements are varied, depending upon the scenario, and could include:  Obtaining pieces of equipment or clothing not usually carried (piton hammers, extreme cold weather parka, jungle boots, or the like).  Adapting medical equipment sets for a specific scenario to include adding items based on the forecasted types of injuries to be encountered (such as more crush injuries and fractures in urban operations or mountain operations). In certain scenarios (such as urban operations), some medical supplies and equipment may not be carried into the fight initially (such as sick call materials), but rather brought forward by follow-on forces. In mountain operations, bulky or heavy items (such as extra tentage) may not accompany the force because of the difficulty in traversing the terrain.  Having individual Soldiers carry additional medical items, such as bandages and intravenous fluids.  Recommending disposition instructions for captured enemy medical supplies and equipment. Under the provisions of the Geneva Conventions, medical supplies and equipment are protected from intentional destruction and should be used to initially treat sick, injured, or wounded detainees. Refer to Chapter 3 for additional information on the Geneva Conventions.  Submitting to higher headquarters those recommendations on medical problems/conditions that require research and development.  Recommending theater policy for medically evacuating contaminated patients.  Coordinating and monitoring patient decontamination operations to include:  Theater policies on patient decontamination operations.  Layout and establishment of patient decontamination site.  Use of collective protection.  Use of nonmedical Soldiers to perform patient decontamination procedures under medical supervision. This paragraph implements STANAG 2132. 2-149. The command surgeon is responsible for the standard of care (scope of practice) which is provided to sick, injured, and wounded Soldiers by subordinate medical personnel, he—  Ensures that standardized protocols for the alleviation of pain (to include the administration of pain relief medications by nonphysician health care providers) are established and disseminated. Further, he must ensure and certify that each military occupational specialty 68W Soldier (combat medic), working under the supervision of a physician, has received sufficient training to—  Recognize when pain management measures and medications are required.  Provide pain management measures (elevation, immobilization, and ice [when available]).  Select the appropriate medication (such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or morphine sulfate); determine the mode of administration (oral or parenteral); be knowledgeable of the possible side effects and how to treat them; and administer the appropriate medication. Chapter 2 2-40 FM 4-02 17 November 2020  Document the treatment provided DD Form 1380 (Tactical Combat Casualty Care [TCCC] Card), to include the marking of individuals who have received morphine sulfate). Note. When morphine is administered to a casualty in the field, the dose, Greenwich Mean Time (ZULU time), date, route of entry, and name of the drug must be entered onto the DD Form 1380. Additionally, the combat medic (or other health care provider) must mark the casualty with the letter “M” (for morphine) and the hour of injection (such as “M 0830”) on the patient’s forehead with a skin pencil or another semipermanent marking substance. The empty syrette, injection device, or its envelope should be attached to the patient’s clothing.  Is also responsible for ensuring that all controlled substances are stored, safeguarded, issued, and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of AR 40-3. The medical equipment set for the combat medic includes morphine sulfate. When the mission supported involves a high risk of trauma, the command surgeon may authorize the combat medic to carry morphine sulfate to alleviate severe pain caused by trauma or wounding. This medication must be accounted for when issued to the combat medic and upon mission completion. TACTICAL COMMANDER AND OPERATIONAL ARMY 2-150. The deployed medical force ensures that the operational commander has the right mixture of medical professional (operational, technical, and clinical) expertise to synchronize the complex system of medical functions required to maintain the health of the command by promoting health and fitness, preventing casualties from DNBI, and promptly treating and evacuating those injured in the OE. Only a focused, responsive, dedicated medical effort can reduce morbidity and mortality and ensure that the operational commander can maintain the health of the Soldiers and uniformed members from the other Services entrusted to the commander’s care by our Nation. According to ADP 1, an Army professional is a member of the Army Profession who meets the Army’s certification criteria of competence, character, and commitment. COMMANDER 2-151. Commanders and unit leaders must take an active role to counter the health threat to their deployed forces.Command emphasis and support is required in the areas of health promotion, field hygiene and sanitation, identification and treatment of Soldiers with potential mild traumatic brain injury, and in promoting the COSC programs to include suicide prevention. 2-152. According to FM 3-0, LSCO is intense, lethal, and brutal. Their conditions include complexity, chaos, fear, violence, fatigue, and uncertainty. Future battlefields will include noncombatants, and they will be crowded in and around large cities. Enemies will employ conventional tactics, terror, criminal activity, and information warfare to further complicate operations. Large-scale combat operations present the greatest challenge for Army forces. Army Health System support must maintain a balance between supporting the commander’s scheme of maneuver during LSCO while still retaining the focus of patient care. HEALTH PROMOTION 2-153. Health promotion is a leadership program that encompasses the assets of educational, environmental, and AHS support services that enable individuals to increase control over and improve their health in support of Army well-being. Commanders and leaders must raise the awareness of health promotion programs and informational sources and establish a command climate which encourages Soldiers to develop healthy habits and make the lifestyle changes required to maximize their personal health and fitness. Refer to ATP 6-22.5 for more information on health and fitness. 2-154. Army health promotion is defined as any combination of health education and related organizational, political, and economic interventions designed to facilitate behavioral and environmental changes conducive to the health and well-being of the Army community. It focuses on the integration of primary prevention and public health practices into community and organizational structure to ensure that health and well-being are part of the way the Army does business. Health is the product of many personal, environmental, and Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-41 behavioral factors. Health promotion programs must consider a broad range of health-related factors and should address the following areas:  Health education and the health promotion process.  Behavioral health programs.  Physical programs.  Spiritual programs.  Environmental and social programs. 2-155. Army health promotion involves—  Identifying community health needs and setting priorities.  Developing, adjusting, and implementing health promotion programs to meet identified needs.  Evaluating the effectiveness of these programs.  Promoting resiliency.  Promoting and enhancing quality of life.  Promoting wellness along with well-being. 2-156. The health promotion process is similar to the risk management process described in ATP 5-19. FIELD HYGIENE AND SANITATION 2-157. To counter the health threat, commanders and leaders must ensure that field hygiene and sanitation, , feral animal risk mitigation measures, inspection of potable water and field feeding facilities, sleep discipline (including work and rest schedules), and personal protective measures are instituted and receive command emphasis. Field hygiene and sanitation combines with personal protective measures, to include correctly wearing the uniform and using insect repellent, sunscreen, and insect netting. Leaders must ensure that Soldiers practice these activities continuously during the force projection through postdeployment cycles and processes. Guidance for establishing, training, and employing unit field sanitation teams can be found in ATP 4-25.12. MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY/CONCUSSION 2-158. Mild traumatic brain injury or concussion is a major health threat facing Soldiers and is recognized as a matter of significant military and operational concern. Concussive injuries are associated with explosions or blasts and blows to the head during training activities or contact sports. Leaders and Soldiers at all echelons must be aware of this invisible injury and receive mild traumatic brain injury/concussion education and training to help decrease stigma associated with seeking medical assistance. Commanders must also be aware of leader reporting requirements, mandatory medical evaluations, and medical reporting requirements. Leaders also have a responsibility to ensure their Soldiers receive a medical evaluation following a concussive event, no matter how mild. Prompt medical attention as soon as possible after an injury maximizes recovery, decreases risk of a subsequent concussion while the brain is healing, and ultimately preserves combat power. Education, training, treatment, and tracking of injured Soldiers are the keys to the Army’s Traumatic Brain Injury Management Strategy. COMBAT AND OPERATIONAL STRESS 2-159. Stress in response to threatening or uncertain situations is a reality in all types of military operations including major combat, stability, and defense support of civil authorities as well as during training exercises, in garrison, and issues related to Family and home life. Soldiers are exposed to various types of combat and operational stress throughout their military experience. Combat and operational stress control refers to a coordinated program of actions taken by military leadership to prevent, identify, and manage reactions to traumatic events that may affect exposed organizations and individuals during unified land operations. Also called COSC. Combat and operational stress control does not take away the experiences faced while engaged in such operations, but provides mechanisms to mitigate reactions to those experiences so that Soldiers remain combat effective and maintain the quality of life to which they are entitled. Chapter 2 2-42 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 SOLDIERS AND THEIR FAMILIES 2-160. It is essential to the morale and effectiveness of our Soldiers and their units that Soldiers recognize and believe they will receive the best and most effective medical care possible should they be wounded or injured. The AHS must ensure that it can provide responsive medical care to our injured or wounded Soldiers regardless of their physical location. Our Soldiers must also be confident that their Family members will receive the highest quality, responsive, and compassionate care at their home station while they are deployed. This confidence in the ability of the AHS to care for both the Soldier and the Soldier’s Family is instrumental in reducing and mitigating some of the combat and operational stresses associated with lengthy deployments. SECTION IV — ARMY HEALTH SYSTEM TEAM OF TEAMS 2-161. The AHS is a system of systems which is comprised of 10 medical functions. The AHS team is composed of a myriad of professional medical, scientific, research, operational, and administrative teams dedicated to the single purpose of providing the best medical care and treatment to our Nation’s Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen and their Families, deployed DOD civilian employees and defense contractors, and to other eligible beneficiaries in their time of need. To achieve this aim, the AHS team must be ready, reliable, responsive, and relevant (Figure 2-13). Figure 2-13. Army Health System—a team of teams Ready 2-162. The AHS views readiness from two perspectives: medical personnel (ready medical force) and the operational Army (medically-ready force). Medical Personnel 2-163. Medical personnel contribute to the success of military operations by applying medical skills and knowledge to problems on the battlefield. Medical personnel undergo institutional and organizational training to ensure they gain appropriate initial qualifications and maintain currency in their discipline. Ongoing training is essential to avoid skill and knowledge fade, and ensures practitioners adapt to evolving clinical practice guidelines, and advances in technology and treatment protocols. The training continuum comprises initial training in a specialty, sustainment training (including medical continuing education requirements), refresher training and pre-deployment training. AHS units (both in the institutional force and the operational Army) participate in realistic and rigorous training focused on reinforcing Soldier skills in the field and exercising the entire scope of battlefield medicine from point-of-injury, through the roles of Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-43 care, to evacuation from the operational area. Training must be integrated with combatant elements to ensure friction points are revealed and resolved before exposure to the added difficulties and uncertainty of actual combat operations. Mastery of the basics of battlefield medicine by all medical personnel is the pivotal component of supporting LSCO. To prepare for combat operations, medical personnel must also be afforded the opportunity to hone their skills and knowledge in demanding clinical environments (e.g., hospitals, emergency medical services and remote clinics). Operational Army 2-164. The AHS collaborates with line commanders to ensure that Soldiers maintain a healthy lifestyle, are physically and mentally fit for deployments, and are medically screened to ensure they do not have on-going medical conditions which could be aggravated by conditions in the AO. Health promotion programs, nutrition programs and counseling, personnel protective measures to include health risk communications and mitigation techniques, preventive dentistry, and COSC programs all focus on maintaining the Soldier’s health both in garrison and when deployed. RELIABLE 2-165. As discussed under partnerships, the Soldier, commander, and Families have confidence that the AHS will always be prepared to provide the appropriate medical care whenever and wherever it may be required. This trust between the AHS and its beneficiaries is at the center of all that the AHS does. It is imperative to the fighting morale of our forces, that each Soldier believes that if injured, he will promptly be given medical care for those wounds and will be medically evacuated from the battlefield. It is also essential that should the Soldier’s Family face a medical emergency while the Soldier is deployed, the Family member will receive state-of-the-art medical care. This in turn relieves some of the stressors the Soldier must manage during deployments and separation from the Soldier’s Family. The AHS system of health is a proven system which has provided reliable health care throughout its history regardless of where needed on the battlefield or in garrison operations. RESPONSIVE 2-166. Both the operational Army and the institutional force must be responsive to the changing OE and the resulting medical implications. Operational Army 2-167. Army Health System planning must be flexible, scalable, and adaptable to optimize the full utilization and integration of scarce medical resources in the accomplishment of the health care delivery mission. The medical command and control organizations must leverage all available medical resources within an AO to optimize patient care to include medical capabilities of sister Services, U.S. governmental agencies, and multinational forces. Institutional Force 2-168. The institutional force is responsive to the health care needs of all Soldiers stationed throughout the world. Combat capability developers use observations, insights, and lessons learned from on-going operations to identify requirements and gaps in order to develop TOE medical organizations which are more modular and adaptive to changes on the battlefield and to incorporate emerging technologies to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of medical materiel. Medical research and development is a vital link between the Army Medicine and the educational and industrial base within CONUS. It enables the MEDCoE to capitalize on emerging technologies and treatment protocols to refine and enhance the state-of-the-art care provided to our Soldiers and other eligible beneficiaries. The military medical education provided within the AHS includes leadership training, enlisted military occupational specialty skills, refresher and sustainment training, medical continuing education, individual Soldier skills, and collective training. Further, if training deficiencies are identified during a deployment, the MEDCoE may develop additional predeployment training packages and assist United States Army Forces Command with predeployment certification of individual and unit skill sets. When appropriate, new equipment training teams provide collective training Chapter 2 2-44 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 to units located throughout the world to ensure the medical personnel are properly trained on how to deploy and employ the new equipment. For example, during the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, a new collective protection shelter system was fielded and training teams from the Army Medicine were deployed to unit locations worldwide to facilitate the transition and use of this new shelter system. 2-169. The institutional force provides a vital link in ensuring the medical readiness of forces to be deployed. Mobilization stations within CONUS ensure Soldiers are medically processed for overseas deployments to include immunizations, eyewear, dental care, medications, resiliency training, and individual patient records are initiated and/or maintained. This ensures the operational commander has a healthy and fit force. For more information, refer to Appendix E.
2-170. The institutional force provides the reachback capability for deployed forces. Requirements for medical specialty personnel generated during the conduct of operations are met by mobilizing and deploying medical resources in the institutional force to meet theater-specific requirements. Additionally, the institutional force provides definitive health care services; restorative, rehabilitative, and convalescent care to enhance and expand on the essential care provided to Soldiers in the deployment area. RELEVANT 2-171. The AHS must provide relevant care based on current operational and strategic plans. The AHS must be adaptive and use innovative approaches and solutions for identified gaps and shortfalls, such as was done to establish the Wounded Warrior Program and to staff Warrior transition units to ensure that our Soldiers’ medical, rehabilitative, and convalescent needs were effectively addressed, as well as providing the appropriate command climate and unit support to either return the Soldier to military duty or to transition back to civilian life as a productive member of society. Clinical Aspects 2-172. The clinical aspects of the operation involve the provision of medical care to sick, injured, and wounded Soldiers (or other designated beneficiaries) and the prevention of DNBI by medically trained individuals. The care extends from the place of injury or wounding and is usually provided initially by the combat medic assigned to a movement and maneuver or fires unit or by a health care provider at the battalion aid station through the successive roles of care to the CONUS-support base, if the patient’s medical condition so warrants. As patients are evacuated between roles of care, they receive en route medical care to sustain them, thus reducing the potential for their medical condition to deteriorate while in-transit. Operational Aspects 2-173. The operational aspects of the mission include such military tasks as:  Maintaining situational understanding of the ongoing and future operations.  Providing timely support to the maneuver forces.  Maintaining the unit’s readiness posture.  Ensuring the survivability of the unit (such as unit perimeter defense, hasty firing positions, and patient bunkers). See ATP 3-37.34 Survivability Operations for more information.  Ensuring compliance with the law of land warfare (to include the Geneva Conventions). 2-174. To accomplish the Army Medicine mission, a synchronization of the clinical and operational aspects must be achieved. It accomplishes nothing for a unit to provide the best clinical care, if it cannot survive the operation. Likewise, a unit that can execute all of its military tasks is not successful if the patients entrusted to its care die or their conditions deteriorate because no consideration was given to their clinical needs during an operational relocation. 2-175. A balance must be achieved in prioritizing the requirements generated from both the operational and clinical aspects of the mission. Without synchronizing the response to the overall requirements, both operational and clinical, a shortfall in one sphere may have serious ramifications on mission success. A shortage of scalpel blades for an FST or FRSD adversely impacts the patient care mission as would a shortage of ammunition for use in perimeter defense which could lead to mission failure in an operational sense. If Army Health System Command and Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 2-45 neither item is available, the FST or FRSD cannot provide the required surgical care to stabilize patients for further evacuation and the unit cannot survive in the OE because it lacks a means for defense. 2-176. To enhance the delivery of health care in the OE and to provide a seamless medical system from the POI or wounding through progressive roles of care to the CONUS-support base, the Army Medicine team must integrate their special skills and knowledge, leverage technology, maximize the use of scarce resources, and synchronize their collective efforts. The accomplishment of the Army Medicine mission necessitates a cohesive unity of effort to provide the care our Soldiers deserve.

Collectively, these treaties are often referred to as The Hague and Geneva Conventions. Whereas the Hague Conventions concern the methods and means of warfare, the Geneva Conventions concern the victims of war or armed conflict.The Geneva Conventions are 4 separate international treaties, signed in 1949. The Conventions are very detailed and contain many provisions, which are tied directly to the medical mission. These Conventions are entitled—  Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field.  Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea.  Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.  Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. SECTION I — THE LAW OF LAND WARFARE 3-1. The conduct of armed hostilities on land is regulated by the law of land warfare. Refer to FM 6-27 for more information. This body of law is inspired by the desire to diminish the evils of war by—  Protecting both combatants and noncombatants from unnecessary suffering.  Safeguarding certain fundamental human rights of persons who fall into the hands of the enemy, particularly detainees, the wounded and sick, and civilians.  Facilitating the restoration of peace. 3-2. The law of land warfare places limits on the exercise of a belligerent’s power in the interest of furthering that desire (diminishing the evils of war) and it requires that belligerents—  Refrain from employing any kind or degree of violence which is not actually necessary for military purposes.  Conduct hostilities with regard for the principles of humanity and chivalry. 3-3. Refer to DODD 2311.01 (DOD law of War Program) and FM 6-27/MCTP 11-10C (The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Land Warfare) for additional information on the law of land warfare. SECTION II — GENEVA CONVENTIONS 3-4. The essential and dominant idea of the GWS is that the Soldier who has been wounded or who is sick, and for that reason is out of the combat in a disabled condition, is from that moment protected. Friend or foe must be tended with the same care. From this principle, numerous obligations are imposed upon parties to a conflict. PROTECTION AND CARE 3-5. Article 12 of the GWS imposes several specific obligations regarding the protection and care of the wounded and sick. Chapter 3 3-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020  The first paragraph of Article 12, GWS, states:  “Members of the armed forces and other persons mentioned in the following Article, who are wounded or sick, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.”  The word respect means “to spare, not to attack” and protect means “to come to someone’s defense, to lend help and support.”  These words make it unlawful to attack, kill, ill-treat, or in any way harm a fallen and unarmed enemy soldier. At the same time, these words impose an obligation to come to aid and give him such care as his condition requires.  This obligation is applicable in all circumstances. The wounded and sick are to be respected just as much when they are with their own army or in no man’s land as when they have fallen into the hands of the enemy.  Combatants, as well as noncombatants, are required to respect the wounded. The obligation also applies to civilians; Article 18, GWS, specifically states:  “The civilian population shall respect these wounded and sick, and in particular abstain from offering them violence.”  The GWS does not define what wounded or sick means, nor has there ever been any definition of the degree of severity of a wound or a sickness entitling the wounded or sick combatant to respect. Any definition would necessarily be restrictive in character and would thereby open the door to misinterpretation and abuse. The meaning of the words wounded and sick is thus a matter of common sense and good faith. It is the act of falling or laying down of arms because of a wound or sickness which constitutes the claim to protection. Only the soldier who is himself seeking to kill may be killed.  The benefits afforded the wounded and sick extend not only to members of the armed forces, but to other categories of persons as well, classes of whom are specified in Article 13, GWS. Even though a wounded person is not in one of the categories enumerated in the article, we must still respect and protect that person. There is a universal principle which says that any wounded or sick person is entitled to respect and humane treatment and the care which his condition requires. Wounded and sick civilians have the benefit of the safeguards of the Geneva Conventions.  The second paragraph of Article 12, GWS, provides that the wounded and sick “…shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Party to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria.”  All adverse distinctions are prohibited. Nothing can justify a belligerent in making any adverse distinction between wounded or sick that require his attention, whether they are friend or foe. Both are on equal footing in the matter of their claims to protection, respect, and care. The foregoing is not intended to prohibit concessions, particularly with respect to food, clothing, and shelter, which take into account the different national habits and backgrounds of the wounded and sick.  The wounded and sick shall not be made the subjects of biological, scientific, or medical experiments of any kind which are not justified on medical grounds and dictated by a desire to improve their condition.  The wounded and sick shall not willfully be left without medical assistance, nor shall conditions exposing them to contagion or infection be created.  The only reasons which can justify priority in the order of treatment are reasons of medical urgency. This is the only justified exception to the principle of equality of treatment of the wounded.  Paragraph 5 of Article 12, GWS, provides that if we must abandon wounded or sick, we have a moral obligation to, “as far as military considerations permit,” leave medical supplies and personnel to assist in their care. This provision is in no way bound up with the absolute obligation imposed by paragraph 2 of Article 12 to care for the wounded. A belligerent can never refuse to care for enemy wounded on the pretext that his adversary has abandoned them without medical personnel and equipment. Army Health System and the Effects of the Law of Land Warfare and Medical Ethics 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 3-3 ENEMY WOUNDED AND SICK 3-6. The protections accorded the wounded and sick apply to friend and foe alike without distinction. Certain provisions of the GWS; however, specifically concern enemy wounded and sick. There are also provisions in the GPW which, because they apply to prisoners of war generally, also apply to enemy wounded or sick.  Article 14 of the GWS states that persons who are wounded and then captured have the status of prisoners of war, however, that wounded soldier is also a person who needs treatment. Therefore, a wounded soldier who falls into the hands of an enemy who is a Party to the GWS and the GPW, such as the U.S., will enjoy protection under both Conventions until his recovery. The GWS will take precedence over the GPW where the two overlap.  Article 16 of the GWS requires the recording and forwarding of information regarding enemy wounded, sick, or dead. (See AR 190-8 and FM 3-63 for disposition of detainees after hospital care.)  When intelligence indicates that large numbers of detainees may result from an operation, medical units may require reinforcement to support the anticipated additional detainee patient workload. SEARCH FOR AND COLLECTION OF CASUALTIES 3-7. Article 15 of the GWS imposes a duty on combatants to search for and collect the dead and wounded and sick as soon as circumstances permit. It is left to the operational commander to judge what is possible and to decide to commit the commander’s medical personnel to this effort. If circumstances permit, an armistice or suspension of fire should be arranged to permit this effort. ASSISTANCE OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION 3-8. Article 18, GWS, addresses the civilian population. It allows a belligerent to ask the civilians to collect and care for wounded or sick of whatever nationality. This provision does not relieve the military authorities of their responsibility to give both physical and moral care to the wounded and sick. The GWS also reminds the civilian population that they must respect the wounded and sick, and in particular, must not injure them. ENEMY CIVILIAN WOUNDED AND SICK 3-9. Certain provisions of the Geneva Conventions are relevant to the medical mission.  Article 16 of the GC provides that enemy civilians who are “…wounded and sick, as well as the infirm, and expectant mothers, shall be the object of particular protection and respect.”  The Article also requires that, “As far as military considerations allow, each Party to the conflict shall facilitate the steps taken to search for the killed and wounded [civilians], to assist…other persons exposed to grave danger, and to protect them against pillage and ill-treatment [emphasis added].”  The “protection and respect” to which wounded and sick enemy civilians are entitled is the same as that accorded to wounded and sick enemy military personnel.  While Article 15 of the GWS requires Parties to a conflict to search for and collect the dead, wounded, and sick members of the armed forces, Article 16 of the GC states that the Parties must “facilitate the steps taken” in regard to civilians. This recognizes the fact that saving civilians is the responsibility of the civilian authorities rather than of the military. The military is not required to provide injured civilians with medical care in a combat zone, however, if we start providing treatment, we are bound by the provisions of the GWS. Provisions for treating civilians (enemy or friendly) will be addressed in EAB regulations.  In occupied territories, the Occupying Power must accord the inhabitants numerous protections as required by the GC. The provisions relevant to medical care include:  Requirement to bring in medical supplies for the population if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate.  Prohibition on requisitioning medical supplies unless the requirements of the civilian population have been taken into account. Chapter 3 3-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020  Duty of ensuring and maintaining, with the cooperation of national and local authorities, the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health, and hygiene in the occupied territory.  Requirement that medical personnel of all categories be allowed to carry out their duties.  Prohibition on requisitioning civilian hospitals on other than a temporary basis and then only in cases of urgent necessity for the care of military wounded and sick and after suitable arrangements have been made for the civilian patients.  Requirement to provide adequate medical treatment to detained persons.  Requirement to provide adequate medical care in detention camps. MEDICAL REPATRIATION 3-10. The Geneva Conventions provide for the repatriation of—  Retained health care personnel once they are no longer needed to provide health care to members of their own forces (Articles 28 and 39, GWS).  Seriously wounded and sick prisoners of war (POWs). 3-11. Parties to the conflict are bound to send back to their own country, regardless of number or rank, seriously wounded and seriously sick POWs, after having cared for them until they are fit to travel. No sick or injured prisoner of war may be repatriated against his will during hostilities (Article 109, GPW). 3-12. The following shall be directly repatriated (Article 110, GPW):  Incurably wounded and sick whose mental or physical fitness seems to have been gravely diminished.  Wounded and sick who, according to medical opinion, are not likely to recover within one year, whose condition requires treatment, and whose mental or physical fitness seems to have been gravely diminished.  Wounded and sick who have recovered, but whose mental or physical fitness seems to have been gravely and permanently diminished. 3-13. The following may be accommodated in a neutral country (Article 110, GPW):  Wounded and sick whose recovery may be expected within one year of the date of the wound or the beginning of the illness, if treatment in a neutral country might increase prospects of a more certain and speedy recovery.  Prisoners of war whose behavioral or physical health, according to medical opinion, is seriously threatened by continued captivity. 3-14. The conditions which POWs accommodated in a neutral country must fulfill in order to permit their repatriation will be fixed, as shall likewise their status, by agreement between the Powers concerned. In general, POWs who have been accommodated in a neutral country, and who belong to the following categories, should be repatriated:  Those whose state of health has deteriorated so as to fulfill the conditions laid down for direct repatriation.  Those whose mental or physical powers remain, even after treatment, considerably impaired. 3-15. Upon the outbreak of hostilities, Mixed Medical Commissions will be appointed to examine sick and wounded POWs and to make all appropriate decisions regarding them (Article 112, GPW). However, POWs who, in the opinion of the medical authorities of the Detaining Power, are manifestly seriously injured or seriously sick, may be repatriated without having been examined by a Mixed Medical Commission. PROTECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF MEDICAL PERSONNEL 3-16. Article 24 of the GWS provides special protection for “Medical personnel exclusively engaged in the search for, or the collection, transport or treatment of the wounded or sick, or in the prevention of disease, [and] staff exclusively engaged in the administration of medical units and establishments . . . [emphasis added].”  Article 25 provides limited protection for “Members of the armed forces specially trained for Army Health System and the Effects of the Law of Land Warfare and Medical Ethics 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 3-5 employment, should the need arise, as hospital orderlies, nurses or auxiliary stretcher-bearers, in the search for or the collection, transport or treatment of the wounded and sick . . . if they are carrying out these duties at the time when they come into contact with the enemy or fall into his hands [emphasis added].” PROTECTION 3-17. There are two separate and distinct forms of protection.  The first is protection from intentional attack if medical personnel are identifiable as such by an enemy in a combat environment. Normally, this is facilitated by medical personnel wearing an armband bearing the distinctive emblem (a Red Cross or Red Crescent on a white background), or by their employment in a medical unit, establishment, or vehicle (including medical aircraft and hospital ships) that displays the distinctive emblem. Persons protected by Article 25 may wear an armband bearing a miniature distinctive emblem only while executing medical duties.  The second protection provided by the GWS pertains to medical personnel who fall into the hands of the enemy. Article 24 personnel are entitled to “retained person” status. They are not deemed to be POWs, but otherwise benefit from the protections of the GPW. Article 28 of the GWS states they are authorized to carry out medical duties only, and “. . . shall be retained only in so far as the state of health . . . and the number of POWs require.”  Article 25 personnel are POWs, but shall be employed to perform medical duties in so far as the need arises. They may be required to perform other duties or labor, and they may be held until a general repatriation of POWs is accomplished upon the cessation of hostilities. SPECIFIC CASES 3-18. Army Medicine personnel and non-Army Medicine personnel assigned to medical units fall into the category identified in Article 24 provided they meet the exclusively engaged criteria of that article. The United States Army does not have any personnel who officially fall into the category identified in Article 25. While it is not a violation of the GWS for Article 24 personnel to perform nonmedical duties, it should be understood; however, that Article 24 personnel lose their protected status under that article if they perform duties or tasks inconsistent with their noncombatant role.Should those personnel later take up their medical duties again, a reasonable argument might be made that they cannot regain Article 24 status since they have not been exclusively engaged in medical duties and that such switching of roles might at best cause such personnel to fall under the category identified in Article 25.  While only Article 25 refers to nurses, nurses are Article 24 personnel if they meet the criteria of that article.  The AHS officers and NCOs assigned to nonmedical positions in a brigade support battalion or a sustainment brigade are neither Article 24 nor Article 25 personnel. Such assignments place them in the role of a combatant. Examples of such personnel are—  The AHS officers serving as commanders of brigade support battalions with responsibility for base or base-cluster defense, as well as command and control of medical and nonmedical units.  The AHS officers and NCOs assigned to nonmedical staff positions with a brigade support battalion with responsibility for planning and supervising the sustainment support for a BCT or other combat unit.  Article 24 personnel who might become Article 25 personnel by virtue of their switching roles could include the following:  A medical company commander, a physician, or the executive officer (a Medical Service Corps officer) detailed as convoy march unit commander with responsibility for medical and nonmedical unit routes of march, convoy control, defense, and repulsing attacks.  Helicopter pilots, who are permanently assigned to a dedicated air ambulance unit, but fly helicopters not bearing the Red Cross emblem on standard combat missions during other times.  The GWS does not itself prohibit the use of Article 24 personnel in perimeter defense of nonmedical units such as areas or base clusters under overall security defense plans, but the policy Chapter 3 3-6 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 of the United States Army is that Article 24 personnel will not be used for this purpose. Adherence to this policy should avoid any issues regarding their status under the GWS due to a temporary change in their role from noncombatant to combatant. Medical personnel may guard their own unit without any concurrent loss of their protected status. IDENTIFICATION CARDS AND ARMBANDS 3-19. Medical personnel who meet the exclusively engaged criteria of Article 24, GWS, are entitled to wear an armband bearing the distinctive emblem of the Red Cross and carry the medical personnel identification card authorized in Article 40, GWS (in the U.S. Armed Services, DD Form 1934 [Geneva Conventions Identity Card for Medical and Religious Personnel Who Serve in or Accompany Armed Forces]). Article 25 personnel and medical personnel serving in positions that do not meet the exclusively engaged criteria of Article 24 are not entitled to carry the medical personnel identification card or wear the distinctive emblem armband. Such personnel carry a DOD Common Access Card, and under Article 25, may wear an armband bearing a miniature distinctive emblem when executing medical duties. The following paragraph implements STANAGs 2060, 2454, and 2931. PROTECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF MEDICAL UNITS, ESTABLISHMENTS, BUILDINGS, MATERIEL, AND MEDICAL TRANSPORTS 3-20. There are two separate and distinct forms of protection: protection from intentional attack and protection when falling into the hands of the enemy. PROTECTION FROM INTENTIONAL ATTACK 3-21. The first is protection from intentional attack if medical units, establishments, or transports are identifiable as such by an enemy in a combat environment. Normally, this is facilitated by medical units or establishments flying a white flag with a Red Cross and by marking buildings and transport vehicles (aircraft or ground) with the distinctive emblem.  It follows that if we cannot attack recognizable medical units, establishments, or transports, we should allow them to continue to give treatment to the wounded in their care as long as this is necessary.  All vehicles employed exclusively on medical transport duty are protected in the operational area. Medical vehicles being used for both military and medical purposes, such as moving wounded personnel during an evacuation and carrying retreating belligerents, are not entitled to protection.  Medical aircraft, like medical transports, are protected from intentional attack, but with a major difference—they are protected “. . . while flying at heights, times and on routes specifically agreed upon between the belligerents concerned.”  (Article 36, GWS.) Such agreements may be made for each specific case or may be of a general nature, concluded for the duration of hostilities. If there is no agreement, belligerents use medical aircraft at their own risk and peril.  Article 37, GWS specifies that “. . . medical aircraft of Parties to the conflict may fly over the territory of neutral Powers, land on it in case of necessity, or use it as a port of call.”  The medical aircraft will “. . . give the neutral Powers previous notice of their passage over the said territory and obey all summons to alight, on land or water.”  The aircraft will be “ . . . immune from attack only when flying on routes, at heights and at times specifically agreed upon between the Parties to the conflict and the neutral Power concerned.”  It further states that “The neutral Powers may, however, place conditions or restrictions on the passage or landing of medical aircraft on their territory.”  The second paragraph of Article 19 imposes an obligation upon those responsible to “. . . ensure that the said medical establishments and units are, as far as possible, situated in such a manner that attacks against military objectives cannot imperil their safety.”  Hospitals should be sited alone, Army Health System and the Effects of the Law of Land Warfare and Medical Ethics 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 3-7 as far as possible from military objectives. The unintentional bombardment of a medical establishment or unit due to its presence among or in proximity to valid military objectives is not a violation of the GWS. Legal protection is certainly valuable, but it is more valuable when accompanied by practical safeguards. PROTECTION WHEN FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY 3-22. The second protection provided by the GWS pertains to medical units, establishments, materiel, and transports that fall into the hands of the enemy.  Captured mobile medical unit materiel is to be used first to treat the patients in the captured unit. If there are no patients in the captured unit, or when those who were there have been moved, the materiel is to be used for the treatment of other wounded and sick persons.  Generally, the buildings, materiel, and stores of fixed medical establishments will continue to be used to treat wounded and sick, however, after provision is made to care for remaining patients, operational commanders may make other use of them. All distinctive markings must be removed if the buildings are to be used for other than medical purposes.  The materiel and stores of fixed establishments and mobile medical units are not to be intentionally destroyed, even to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. In certain extreme cases, buildings may have to be destroyed for operational reasons.  Medical transports that fall into enemy hands may be used for any purpose once arrangement has been made for the medical care of the wounded and sick they contain. The distinctive markings must be removed if they are to be used for nonmedical purposes.  A medical aircraft is supposed to obey a summons to land for inspection. If it is performing its medical mission, it is supposed to be released to continue its flight. If examination reveals that an act “harmful to the enemy” (for example, if the aircraft is carrying munitions) has been committed, it loses the protections of the Conventions and may be seized. If a medical aircraft makes an involuntary landing, all aboard, except the medical personnel, will be POWs. A medical aircraft refusing a summons to land is a fair target. IDENTIFICATION 3-23. The GWS contains several provisions regarding the use of the Red Cross emblem on medical units, establishments, and transports. (The identification of medical personnel has been previously discussed.)  Article 39 of the GWS reads as follows:  “Under the direction of the competent military authority, the emblem shall be displayed on the flags, armlets and on all equipment employed in the Medical Service.”  There is no obligation of a belligerent to mark his units with the emblem. Sometimes a commander (generally no lower than a brigade commander for NATO forces) may order the camouflage of his medical units in order to conceal the presence or real strength of his forces. The enemy must respect a medical unit if he knows of its presence, even one that is camouflaged or not marked. The absence of a visible Red Cross emblem, however, coupled with a lack of knowledge on the part of the enemy as to the unit’s protected status, may render that unit’s protection valueless.  The distinctive emblem is not a Red Cross alone; it is a Red Cross on a white background. Should there be some good reason, however, why an object protected by the Convention can only be marked with a Red Cross without a white background, belligerents may not make the fact that it is so marked a pretext for refusing to respect it.  Some countries use the Red Crescent on a white background in place of the Red Cross. This emblem is recognized as an authorized exception under Article 38, GWS. Additional Protocol III to the Geneva Conventions also recognizes the Red Crystal. The Red Crystal replaces the Red Star of David.  The initial phrase of Article 39 shows that it is the military commander who controls the emblem and can give or withhold permission to use it. He is at all times responsible for the Chapter 3 3-8 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 use made of the emblem and must see that it is not improperly used by the troops or by individuals.  Article 42 of the GWS specifically addresses the marking of medical units and establishments.  “The distinctive flag of the Convention shall be hoisted only over such medical units and establishments as are entitled to be respected under the Convention, and only with the consent of the military authorities.”  (Paragraph 1, Article 42, GWS.) Although the Convention does not define “the distinctive flag of the Convention,” what is meant is a white flag with a Red Cross in its center. Also, the word “flag” must be taken in its broadest sense. Hospitals are often marked by one or several Red Cross emblems painted on the roof. Finally, the military authority must consent to the use of the flag (see the above comments on Article 39) and must ensure that the flag is used only on buildings entitled to protection.  “In mobile units, as in fixed establishments, it [the distinctive flag] may be accompanied by the national flag of the Party to the conflict to which the unit or establishment belongs.” (Article 42, GWS.) This provision makes it optional to fly the national flag with the Red Cross flag. It should be noted that in an operational area the national flag is a symbol of belligerency and is therefore likely to provoke attack.  In a NATO conflict, NATO STANAG 2931 provides for camouflage of the Geneva emblem on medical facilities where the lack of camouflage might compromise operations. Medical facilities on land, supporting forces of other nations, will display or camouflage the Geneva emblem in accordance with national regulations and procedures. When failure to camouflage would endanger or compromise operational operations, the camouflage of medical facilities may be ordered by a NATO commander of at least brigade level or equivalent. Such an order is to be temporary and local in nature and countermanded as soon as the circumstances permit. It is not envisaged that fixed, large, medical facilities would be camouflaged. The STANAG defines “medical facilities” as “medical units, medical vehicles, and medical aircraft on the ground.” Note. There is no such thing as a “camouflaged” Red Cross. When camouflaging a medical unit either cover up the Red Cross or take it down. A black cross on an olive drab or any other background is not a symbol recognized under the Geneva Conventions. 3-24. For additional guidance on the marking of air ambulances, refer to AR 40-3 and TM 1-1500-345-23. For more information on approved medical symbols, refer to Appendix F.
LOSS OF PROTECTION OF MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENTS AND UNITS 3-25. Medical assets lose their protected status by committing acts “harmful to the enemy.”  (Article 21, GWS.) A warning must be given to the offending unit and a reasonable amount of time allowed to cease such activity. ACTS HARMFUL TO THE ENEMY 3-26. The phrase “acts harmful to the enemy” is not defined in the Convention, but should be considered to include acts the purpose or effect of which is to harm the enemy, by facilitating or impeding military operations. Such harmful acts would include, for example, the use of a hospital as a shelter for able-bodied combatants, as an arms or ammunition dump, or as a military observation post. Another instance would be the deliberate sitting of a medical unit in a position where it would impede an enemy attack. WARNING AND TIME LIMIT 3-27. The enemy has to warn the unit to put an end to the harmful acts and must fix a time limit on the conclusion of which he may open fire or attack if the warning has not been complied with. The phrase in all appropriate cases recognizes that there might obviously be cases where no time limit could be allowed. A body of troops approaching a hospital and met by heavy fire from every window would return fire without delay. Army Health System and the Effects of the Law of Land Warfare and Medical Ethics 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 3-9 USE OF SMOKE AND OBSCURANTS 3-28. The use of smoke and obscurants during MEDEVAC operations for signaling or marking landing zones does not constitute an act harmful to the enemy, however, employing such devices to obfuscate a medical element’s position or location is tantamount to camouflaging; it would jeopardize its entitlement privilege status under the GWS. Refer to Army doctrine for MEDEVAC for additional information on the use of smoke and obscurants for medical operations. CONDITIONS NOT DEPRIVING MEDICAL UNITS AND ESTABLISHMENTS OF PROTECTION 3-29. Article 22 of the GWS reads as follows:  “The following conditions shall not be considered as depriving a medical unit or establishment of the protection guaranteed by Article 19:  (1) That the personnel of the unit or establishment are armed, and that they use the arms in their own defense (sic), or in that of the wounded and sick in their charge. (2)  That in the absence of armed orderlies, the unit or establishment is protected by a picket or by sentries or by an escort. (3)  That small arms and ammunition taken from the wounded and sick and not yet handed to the proper service, are found in the unit or establishment. (4)  That personnel and material (sic) of the veterinary service are found in the unit or establishment, without forming an integral part thereof. (5) That the humanitarian activities of medical units and establishments or of their personnel extend to the care of civilian wounded or sick.” ACTS 3-30. These five conditions are not to be regarded as acts harmful to the enemy. These are particular cases where a medical unit retains its character and its right to immunity, in spite of certain appearances which might lead to a contrary conclusion or, at least, create some doubt. DEFENSE OF MEDICAL UNITS AND SELF-DEFENSE BY MEDICAL PERSONNEL 3-31. A medical unit is granted a privileged status under the law of land warfare. This status is based on the view that medical personnel are not combatants and that their role in the combat area is exclusively a humanitarian one. In recognition of the necessity of self-defense, however, medical personnel may be armed for their own defense or for the protection of the wounded and sick under their charge. To retain this privileged status, they must refrain from all aggressive action and may only employ their weapons if attacked in violation of the Conventions. They may not employ arms against enemy forces acting in conformity with the law of land warfare and may not use force to prevent the capture of their unit by the enemy (it is, on the other hand, perfectly legitimate for a medical unit to withdraw in the face of the enemy). Medical personnel who use their arms in circumstances not justified by the law of land warfare expose themselves to penalties for violation of the law of land warfare.Provided they have been given due warning to cease such acts, they may also forfeit the protection of the medical unit or establishment which they are protecting.  Medical personnel are not authorized crew-served or offensive weapons. They may carry small arms, such as rifles, pistols, squad automatic weapons, or authorized substitutes in the defense of medical facilities, equipment, and personnel/patients without surrendering the protections afforded by the Geneva Conventions. Further, Army Medicine and non- Army Medicine personnel in medical units are not required to train and qualify on crew-served weapons, however, Army Medicine personnel attending training at Noncommissioned Officer Education System courses will receive weapons instruction that is part of the curriculum. This will ensure the successful completion of the course is not jeopardized by failure to attend the weapons training portion of the curriculum. (Refer to AR 350-1 for further information).  The presence of machine guns, grenade launchers, booby traps, hand grenades, light antitank weapons, or mines (regardless of the method by which they are detonated) in or around a medical unit or establishment would seriously jeopardize its entitlement privilege status under the GWS. The deliberate arming of a medical unit with such items could constitute an act harmful to the enemy and cause the medical unit to lose its protection, regardless of the location of the medical unit. Chapter 3 3-10 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Guarding Medical Units 3-32. As a rule, a medical unit is to be guarded by its own personnel, however, it will not lose its protected status if the guard is performed by a number of armed Soldiers. The military guard attached to a medical unit may use its weapons, just as armed medical personnel may, to ensure the protection of the unit. But, as in the case of medical personnel, the Soldiers may only act in a purely defensive manner and may not oppose the occupation or control of the unit by an enemy who is respecting the unit’s privileged status. The status of such Soldiers is that of ordinary members of the armed forces. The mere fact of their presence with a medical unit will shelter them from attack. In case of capture, they will be POWs. Arms and Ammunition taken from the Wounded 3-33. Wounded persons arriving in a medical unit may still be in possession of small arms and ammunition, which will be taken from them and handed to authorities outside the medical unit. Should a unit be captured by the enemy before it is able to get rid of these arms, their presence is not of itself cause for denying the protection to be accorded the medical unit under the GWS. Personnel and Materiel of Veterinary Services 3-34. The presence of personnel and materiel of Veterinary Services with a medical unit is authorized, even where they do not form an integral part of such unit. Care of Civilian Wounded and Sick 3-35. A medical unit or establishment protected by the GWS may take in civilians, as well as military wounded and sick, without jeopardizing its privileged status. This clause merely sanctions what is actually done in practice. THE 1977 PROTOCOLS TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS 3-36. Amendments to the Geneva Conventions have been ratified by some of our allies and potential adversaries. The U.S. representative to the diplomatic conference signed these amendments, but they have not been officially ratified by our government. COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS 3-37. The U.S. is a party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Two of these Conventions afford protection for medical personnel, facilities, and evacuation platforms (to include aircraft on the ground). All medical personnel should thoroughly understand the provisions of the Geneva Conventions that apply to medical activities. Violation of these Conventions can result in the loss of the protection afforded by them. Medical personnel should inform the operational commander of the consequences of violating the provisions of these Conventions. The consequences can include the following:  Medical evacuation assets subjected to attack and destruction by the enemy.  Medical capability degraded. Captured medical personnel becoming POWs rather than retained persons. They may not be permitted to treat fellow prisoners.  Loss of protected status for medical unit, personnel, or evacuation platforms (to include aircraft on the ground). 3-38. Because even the perception of impropriety can be detrimental to the mission and U.S. interests, medical commanders must ensure that they do not give the impression of impropriety in the conduct of medical operations. For example, the MMB commander included in the operational SOP rules governing the use of crew-served weapons, it would give the impression that the unit possessed and intended to use these types of weapons. Under the provisions of the GC, medical units are only authorized individual small arms and squad automatic weapons for use in the defense of the patients under their care and for themselves. Even though the unit did not possess these types of weapons, the entry in the operational SOP could be misinterpreted and a case made that the commander intended to use these weapons in violation of the Geneva Conventions. Army Health System and the Effects of the Law of Land Warfare and Medical Ethics 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 3-11 MEDICAL CARE FOR DETAINED PERSONNEL 3-39. It is DOD policy that the U.S. military Services shall comply with the principles, spirit, and intent of the international law of war, both customary and codified, to include the GCs. As such, captured or detained personnel will be accorded an appropriate legal status under international law and conventions. Personnel in U.S. custody will receive medical care consistent with the standard of medical care that applies for U.S.
military personnel in the same geographic area. Refer to DODD 2310.01E, DODI 2310.08E, JP 3-63, JP 4- 02, AR 40-400, AR 190-8, and ATP 4-02.46 for additional information on medical care for detained personnel. SECTION III — MEDICAL ETHICS 3-40. Health care personnel are well-trained in and guided by the ethics of their professional calling. This training and ethical principles, coupled with the requirements of international law as it pertains to the treatment of detainees, and civilians during conflict will ensure the ethical treatment of all sick and wounded personnel. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE MEDICAL TREATMENT OF DETAINEES 3-41. Health care personnel (particularly physicians) perform their duties consistent with the following basic principles:  Health care personnel have a duty in all matters affecting the physical and BH of detainees to perform, encourage, and support, directly and indirectly, actions to uphold the humane treatment of detainees. They must ensure that no individual in the custody or under the physical control of the DOD, regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment as defined in U.S. law.  Health care personnel charged with the medical care of detainees have a duty to protect detainees’ physical and BH and provide appropriate treatment for disease. To the extent practicable, treatment of detainees should be guided by professional judgments and standards similar to those applied to personnel of the United States Armed Forces.  Health care personnel shall not be involved in any professional provider-patient treatment relationship with detainees the purpose of which is not solely to evaluate, protect, or improve their physical and BH.  Health care personnel, whether or not in a professional provider-patient treatment relationship, shall not apply their knowledge and skills in a manner that is not applicable law or the standards set forth in DODD 2310.01E.  Health care personnel shall not certify, or participate in the certification of, the fitness of detainees for any form of treatment or punishment that is not in consonance with applicable law, or participate in any way in the administration of any such treatment or punishment.  Health care personnel shall not participate in any procedure for applying physical restraints to the person of a detainee unless such a procedure is determined to be necessary for the protection of the physical or BH or the safety of the detainee, or necessary for the protection of other detainees or those treating, guarding, or otherwise interacting with them. Such restraints, if used, shall be applied in a safe and professional manner. 3-42. Health care personnel engaged in a professional provider-patient treatment relationship with detainees shall not participate in detainee-related activities for purposes other than health care. Such health care personnel shall not actively solicit information from detainees for other than medical purposes. Health care personnel engaged in nontreatment activities, such as forensic psychology, behavioral science consultation, forensic pathology, or similar disciplines, shall not engage in any professional provider-patient treatment relationship with detainees (except in emergency circumstances in which no other health care providers can respond adequately to save life or prevent permanent impairment).  During the initial screening of detainees any preexisting medical conditions, wounds, fractures, and bruises should be noted. Documentation of these injuries/conditions provides a baseline for Chapter 3 3-12 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 each detainee which facilitates the identification of injuries which may have occurred in the detention facility.  Detainees who report for routine sick call should be visually examined to determine if any unusual or suspicious injuries are apparent. If present, the health care provider should determine from the detainee how the injuries occurred. Any injuries which cannot be explained or for which the detainee is providing evasive responses should be noted in the medical record and should be reported to the chain of command, technical medical channels, and United States Army Criminal Investigation Command.  Health care personnel may enter the holding areas of the facility for a variety of reasons. These can include, but are not limited to, conducting sanitary inspections, providing TCCC, and dispensing medications. When in the holding areas of the facility, health care personnel must be observant. Should they observe anything suspicious which might indicate that detainees are being mistreated, they should report these suspicions immediately to the chain of command. Should they observe a detainee being mistreated, they should take immediate action to stop the abuse and then report the incident. 3-43. Detained personnel must have access to the same available standard of medical care as the U.S. and unified action partners to include respect for their dignity and privacy. In general, the security of detainees’ medical records and confidentiality of medical information will be managed the same way as for the U.S.
and multinational forces. During detainee operations, the patient administrator, the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the medical chain of command can have access to detainee medical records besides the treating health care personnel. 3-44. Health care personnel shall safeguard patient confidences and privacy within the constraints of the law. Under U.S. and international law and applicable medical practice standards, there is no absolute confidentiality of medical information for any person. Detainees shall not be given cause to have incorrect expectations of privacy or confidentiality regarding their medical records and communications, however, whenever patient-specific medical information concerning detainees is disclosed for purposes other than treatment, health care personnel shall record the details of such disclosure, including the specific information disclosed, the person to whom it was disclosed, the purpose of the disclosure, and the name of the medical unit commander (or other designated senior medical activity officer) approving the disclosure. Similar to legal standards applicable to U.S. citizens, permissible purposes include preventing harm to any person, maintaining public health and order in detention facilities, and any lawful law enforcement, or national security-related activity. 3-45. In any case in which the medical unit commander (or other designated senior medical activity officer) suspects that the medical information to be disclosed may be misused, he should seek a senior command determination that the use of the information will be consistent with the applicable standards. 3-46. The information disclosed to a physician during the course of the relationship between physician and patient is confidential to the greatest possible degree. The patient should feel free to make a full disclosure of information to the physician in order that the physician may most effectively provide needed services. The patient should be able to make this disclosure with the knowledge that the physician will respect the confidential nature of the communication. The physician should not reveal confidential communications or information without the express consent of the patient, unless required to do so by law. The obligation to safeguard patient confidences is subject to certain exceptions, which are ethically and legally justified because of overriding social considerations. Where a patient threatens to inflict serious bodily harm to another person or to himself and there is a reasonable probability that the patient may carry out the threat, the physician should take reasonable precautions for the protection of the intended victim, including notification of law enforcement authorities. 3-47. Patient consent for the release of medical records is not required. The MTF commander or commander’s designee, usually the patient administrator, determines what information is appropriate for release. Only that specific medical information or medical record required to satisfy the terms of a legitimate request will be authorized for disclosure. 3-48. Because the chain of command is ultimately responsible for the care and treatment of detainees, the detention facility chain of command requires some medical information. For example, detainees suspected Army Health System and the Effects of the Law of Land Warfare and Medical Ethics 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 3-13 of having infectious diseases such as tuberculosis should be separated from other detainees. Guards and other personnel who come into contact with such patients should be informed about their health risks and how to mitigate those risks. 3-49. Releasable medical information on internees includes that which is necessary to supervise the general state of health, nutrition, and cleanliness of internees and to detect contagious diseases. Such information should be used to provide health care; to ensure health and safety of internees, soldiers, employees, or others at the facility; to ensure law enforcement on the premises; and to ensure the administration and maintenance of the safety, security, and good order of the facility. 3-50. For additional information on medical ethics refer to the Textbooks of Military Medicine:  Military Medical Ethics, Volumes I and II, and The Emergency War Surgery Handbook. Both of these publications are available electronically at the Borden Institute website. 3-51. The provision of health care to detainees within MTFs or other facilities (such as dispensaries located within detention or holding facilities) is a unique role within the military structure. This role is governed by rules and regulations designed to ensure the provision of health care while ensuring personal safety and maintenance of security, custody, and discipline in a detention/holding facility environment. Health care personnel must ensure that their actions, both on- and off-duty, do not undermine their ability to function effectively among detainees or compromise established health care, safety, security, and custody guidelines. Note. The process of abiding by the principles of ethical treatment of personnel regardless of national/adversarial affiliation and navigating rules regarding employment of weapon systems, markings, and duties, can be challenging. Units are strongly encouraged to consult with their servicing Staff Judge Advocate and Unit Ministry Team for advisement. This page intentionally left blank. 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 4-1 Chapter 4 Army Health System Operations Army Health System support is provided across the competition continuum and various types of mission support (traditional support to a deployed force, operations predominantly characterized by stability tasks, and defense support of civil authorities) may be provided simultaneously in various locations throughout the operational area. SECTION I — PLANNING FOR ARMY HEALTH SYSTEM SUPPORT 4-1. Army Health System planners must anticipate the types of support that may be required and develop flexible plans that can be rapidly adjusted to changes in the level of violence and operational tempo, as well as to transition from one type of task to the next. UNIFIED LAND OPERATIONS 4-2. Unified land operations describe the character of the dominant major operation being conducted at any time within the land force commander’s AO. The competition continuum helps convey the nature of the major operation to the force to facilitate common understanding of how the commander broadly intends to operate. See ADP 3-0 on unified land operations for an in-depth discussion of the competition continuum. Further, refer to AHS doctrine for medical planning considerations. 4-3. Unified land operations are executed through decisive action by means of Army core competencies that are guided by mission command.The Army’s core competencies are combined arms maneuver and wide area security (ADP 1) with a number of enabling competencies. These enabling competencies include security cooperation, tailoring forces, entry operations, flexible command and control, the support we provide to the joint force. 4-4. As all major operations are joint in nature, the competition continuum can be used to group similar types of activities under a predominant theme. Unified land operations are simultaneous offensive, defensive, and stability or defense support of civil authorities’ tasks to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative to shape OEs, prevent conflict, consolidate gains, and win our Nation’s wars as part of unified action (ADP 3-0). OPERATIONAL VARIABLES 4-5. As the OE is comprised of all of the factors, both military and civilian, that affect the conduct of military operations in an operational area, the medical commander must define how the different elements will impact on the concept of operations. The operational variables are a means for exploring and describing an OE that focuses on the human aspects of the environment. Commanders and planners can use political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, and time (operational variables) to ensure all elements are considered. The operational variables are used by strategic planners in the development of plans and information may be broader than required for mission analysis at the tactical level, however, as medical issues often have a regional focus and may be the result of environmental, socioeconomic, political, and religious practices, it is essential for the AHS planner to consider the medical aspects of an operation on a much broader scale than the immediate AO. As the theater medical command, the MEDCOM (DS) provides this regional focus in support of the CCDRs theater engagement strategy. For a detailed discussion of each of the political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, time (operational variables) considerations, refer to ADP 5-0. Chapter 4 4-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 4-6. Table 4-1 provides medical aspects for consideration in relation to the operational variables and subvariables. This table is not an all-inclusive listing but does provide the AHS planner with some initial considerations. Table 4-1.

Employment status. Economic activity. Illegal economic activity. Banking and finance. The economic base can affect health care for both the human and the animal populations in the nation. The types of injuries and health issues may vary significantly based upon whether it is an agricultural society or an industrialized nation and/or region. This affects the types of health care available including restorative and rehabilitative services and programs and the availability of health care to the populace. The gross national product and the per capita income of the population affect the availability of resources for the government to expend on public health concerns and health care in general. When the Army Health System planner examines the economic factors of a nation or region, it is important to determine what influence it has on how much money is expended in the health sector (both private and public) as this will affect health care, medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals availability. Social Demographic mix. Social volatility. Education level. Ethnic diversity. Religious diversity. Population movement. Common languages. Criminal activity. Human rights. Centers of social power. Basic cultural norms and values. Age, gender, and genetics affect how individuals are affected by disease and existing environmental factors. Religion affects how people view medical intervention; it can affect how a person will comply with medical treatment regimens and whether they will accept recommended treatments (such as the use of blood transfusions). Persons who are uprooted may be more susceptible to disease because of lowered immunity status due to fatigue, restricted food intake, poor living conditions, inadequate shelters, and poor sanitation. If public health and disease prevention programs are not instituted, the general health of the population or the affected subpopulation will decrease. Populations where education and literacy are not widespread will often have a lower standard of living, less appreciation for public health and disease prevention practices, less skilled workers, and be more difficult to reach with public health alerts and programs. Cultural, ethnic, and religious beliefs often influence who will seek medical care and who will not. Privacy issues may require that consideration of the provider’s gender is relevant in addressing women's health issues. Providers must be cautious in using graphic aids to communicate with their patients, as the explicit graphics may be considered offensive. Chapter 4 4-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Table 4-1.

NOTE:  Subvariables marked with an asterisk (*) are also the military aspects of terrain and weather used in analyzing mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations. MISSION VARIABLES 4-7. Mission variables are used by AHS planners to determine the impact they will have on medical operations. Mission variables describe characteristics of the operational area, focusing on how they might affect a mission. The mission variables are discussed below. In Table 4-1 above, the subvariables which are the same as mission variable considerations are marked with an asterisk (*). For an in-depth discussion of the mission variables, refer to ADP 5-0. MISSION 4-8. The mission refers to the overall mission of the operational commander, as well as the specific mission of the supporting AHS unit. In order to develop a flexible and responsive support plan, the AHS planner must have a clear understanding of the operational mission, the purpose of that mission, and the tasks/actions to be performed and the rationale for accomplishing those actions. The AHS planner must be able to forecast where AHS support assets should be positioned to best support the CCDRs plan and also anticipate if augmentation of medical resources will be required and preplan, coordinate, and synchronize the employment of this augmentation support should the need arise. ENEMY 4-9. The second variable the AHS planner must consider is the enemy. The elements of dispositions (including organization, strength, location, and operational mobility), doctrine, equipment, capabilities, vulnerabilities, and probable courses of action are considered by the operational planners and the important factors are normally reflected in the OPORD. The AHS planner must also analyze the potential impacts on the provision of AHS support to our forces. The enemy weapons systems will indicate the types of wounds which U.S. forces may experience (conventional weapons, blast, CBRN, or improvised weapons [such as punji sticks used in Vietnam that resulted in countless numbers of infected wounds and improvised explosive devices used in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom]) and give an indication on the Chapter 4 4-6 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 types and quantities of medical supplies that will be required. If enemy forces have been issued any chemoprophylaxis, barrier creams, or pretreatments, it may indicate the types of CBRN weaponry available to them and their likelihood of using those types of weapons. The morale of the enemy and its likelihood of engaging in sustained combat is often dependent upon the nutritional status of the enemy and the availability of medical aid should they become injured. A malnourished enemy with little hope of being rescued and surviving the enemy’s injuries will normally not have the will to continue the fight. Medical personnel must also be knowledgeable about the enemy doctrine in respect to whether it is likely to abide by the provisions of international law and the Geneva Conventions pertaining to the protection and respect of medical personnel. (Refer to Chapter 3 for a discussion of the Geneva Conventions). TERRAIN AND WEATHER 4-10. The military aspects of terrain and weather are listed in Table 4-1. The AHS planner must continuously plan for changes in weather and terrain conditions when conducting AHS support operations. The AHS’s effectiveness and efficiency are based on a system of progressively increasing the complexity of medical resources and services available from the POI or wounding through the operational area AHS to definitive, restorative, and rehabilitative care in the CONUS-support base. The fully integrated ground and air MEDEVAC system sustains the care provided at a lower role as the patient is evacuated to a role of care capable of providing the required support. This continuum of care is effective in reducing morbidity and mortality, mitigating long-term disability, and restoring a Soldier’s health and fitness. Any factor that disrupts this continuum can have an adverse impact on a Soldier’s prognosis and long-term disability. Therefore, the AHS planner must develop contingency plans for all types of weather scenarios, changes in topography due to weather (flooding, thawing, or freezing), trafficability/nontrafficability of evacuation routes, availability of resources (rotary-wing aircraft may be grounded due to visibility issues, sandstorms, or other weather phenomenon). The types of medical supplies required for an operation may vary depending upon the terrain/weather. Operations conducted in mountainous terrain may result in more crush injuries, while operations conducted in jungles may result in significantly higher rates of infection. The disruption or cessation of MEDEVAC operations would result in a requirement for holding the injured or ill in place; medical personnel would then be required to provide prolonged care until MEDEVAC operations could be resumed. This circumstance would require that the treatment elements be augmented with additional holding capability, more medical supplies, and possible increased surgical or other medical specialty capability. For an AHS planner, this type of contingency planning, coordinating, and synchronizing needs to occur prior to an operation, as the health of a patient is perishable and may not withstand delays in treatment and evacuation. TROOPS AND SUPPORT AVAILABLE 4-11. The AHS planner must not only consider the traditional populations which require support (such as U.S. forces or multinational forces) but must also determine the population at risk in a more broad context. During each operation, the population at risk may vary due to political, social, economic, religious, and humanitarian considerations. The AHS planner must develop a traditional support plan, but must also develop a number of contingency plans in the event the population at risk and population support changes during the operation. If the AHS planner does not anticipate an increase in nontraditional populations supported, the diversion of AHS resources can adversely impact the delivery of health care to our U.S. forces. The support requirements (food, medicines, and medical supplies) for a civilian population who is malnourished, has pediatric, obstetrics and gynecological, and geriatric patients, and patients with chronic medical conditions varies significantly from the items available in the medical equipment sets routinely carried by United States Army AHS units. Prior planning, coordinating, and synchronization with CONUS- based organizations is required to ensure the appropriate mix of medical items can be deployed to rapidly augment United States Army AHS units. TIME AVAILABLE 4-12. Military commanders assess the time available for planning, preparing, and executing tasks and operations. This includes the time required to assemble, deploy, and maneuver units in relationship to the enemy and conditions. Army Health System planners also view time in relationship to the continuum of care and timeframes required to treat and evacuate patients. For example, if an FST or FRSD is to operate on a seriously injured Soldier, the FST or FRSD will not be able to displace and move for at least six hours, as the Army Health System Operations 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 4-7 Soldier will require a period of time to become hemodynamically stable following surgery if he is to survive the rigors of evacuation. CIVIL CONSIDERATIONS 4-13. Civil considerations are the influence of man-made infrastructure, civilian institutions, and activities of civilian leaders, populations, and organizations within the operational area on the conduct of military operations. The operational and mission variables are used to analyze to analyze the civil aspects of the area.Field Manual 3-24/MCWP 3-33.5 provides an in-depth analysis of this model. The AHS planner must always analyze the local and the regional medical aspects in any given AO. Although the immediate local considerations are important, in the medical arena the regional aspects may be just as important. Areas such as blood supply, type, species, and virulence of disease vectors may vary across the operational area and adversely impact the health of U.S. forces. TASK-ORGANIZATION 4-14. Task-organization is a tool used by commanders to tailor their forces to specific mission requirements. Task-organization is a temporary grouping of forces designed to accomplish a particular mission. Traditionally, task-organization was accomplished by combining entire units; however with the advent of modularity, commanders are task-organizing elements of the organization rather than the entire organization. This enables a commander to extract the individual capabilities required for a specific mission, to project the smallest footprint possible, yet still be able to effectively and efficiently accomplish the mission. Modularly designed units with deployable functional elements identified with a standard requirements code can be easily integrated into the time phased force deployment list process to ensure the rapid movement of both the unit’s/element’s personnel and equipment. Characteristics to examine when task-organizing the force include, but are not limited to: training, experience, equipage, sustainability, OE, enemy threat, and mobility. Additional considerations include constraints on manpower (troop ceilings), ability for a unit or element to be self-sufficient (for example, FST or FRSD must be collocated with a medical company for power generation, x-ray, laboratory, and other services), and the population at risk (additional augmentation is required to support chronic medical conditions [present in the contractor and civilian employee force], pediatric, geriatric, and obstetric patients). 4-15. The MMB is a versatile organization which can serve as the parent unit when developing a medical task force. The MMB has a diverse staff which can provide the planning and administrative support for the medical functional elements assigned to the medical task force. SECTION II — SUPPORT TO DECISIVE ACTION 4-16. Decisive action is the simultaneous combination of offense, defense, and stability or defense support of civil authority tasks. These tasks require versatile, adaptive medical support, and flexible leadership. 4-17. Operational experience demonstrates that AHS forces trained exclusively for offensive and defensive tasks are not as proficient at stability tasks. Effective medical training reflects a balance among the elements of decisive action that produces and sustains proficiency in all the tasks. See ADP 3-0 for additional information on decisive action. 4-18. The traditional and primary Army Medicine mission is to conserve the fighting strength of the tactical commander. The Army Medicine rhythm of military operations is that of the operational commander. Casualties begin to occur immediately upon engagement with the enemy. Due to the necessity to perform lifesaving interventions for Soldiers suffering combat trauma within minutes of wounding or injury, AHS resources must be arrayed in close proximity to the forces supported. This also permits the AHS assets to rapidly clear the battlefield of casualties and enhances the CCDRs ability to quickly take advantage of opportunities which present themselves during the operation. 4-19. Army Health System planners must be included early-on in the planning cycle for tactical operations and must fully participate in rehearsals conducted by the operational Army being supported. To ensure effective and efficient AHS support, AHS support plans must adhere to the AHS principles. Within noncontiguous operations, the linear array of AHS units will not always occur and AHS units must fully Chapter 4 4-8 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 understand the various support relationships described in the OPORDs to ensure that a seamless continuum of health care is established and can be maintained. 4-20. The MEDEVAC plan for the tactical operation includes both rotary-wing air ambulances and ground ambulances. The preferred means of evacuation is the air ambulance; however its availability can be affected by air superiority issues and environmental factors such as visibility, winds, and dust. The evacuation plan must address the use of ground ambulances when feasible and/or the simultaneous use of both platforms. For example, if a wounded Soldier cannot be evacuated by air ambulance for at least 1 hour, the combat medic may evacuate the patient first to the supporting Role 1 (or Role 2) MTF to arrive within 20 minutes for TCCC performed by the physician assigned to the battalion aid station to further stabilize the patient before he is evacuated by air ambulance. OFFENSIVE TASKS 4-21. An offensive task is a task conducted to defeat and destroy enemy forces and seize terrain, resources, and population centers. The direct action offensive tasks are depicted in Table 4-2 along with key medical considerations for these types of tasks. For additional information on offensive tasks, refer to FM 3-0. Table 4-2. Offensive tasks, purposes, and key medical considerations Offensive tasks Purposes Key medical considerations Movement to contact Attack Exploitation Pursuit Dislocate, isolate, disrupt, and destroy enemy forces. Seize key terrain. Deprive the enemy of resources. Develop intelligence. Deceive and divert the enemy. Create a secure environment for stability tasks. All medical functions fully synchronized. Medical information management to document health threat exposures and medical encounters, to report health surveillance data and information on the health of the command, and to accomplish medical regulating and patient tracking operations. Locate, acquire, stabilize, treat, and evacuate injured or ill Soldiers from the battlefield to facilitate the operational commander’s ability to exploit opportunities on the battlefield. Trauma care, forward resuscitative care, and en route medical care to sustain the patient through medical evacuation to the appropriate role of care. Responsive medical logistics which facilitates and sustains the treatment of patients during the fight. Theater hospitalization to provide essential care in theater to all categories of patients. DEFENSIVE TASKS 4-22. A defensive task is a task conducted to defeat an enemy attack, gain time, economize forces, and develop conditions favorable for offensive or stability tasks. 4-23. Army Health System support operations for defensive tasks are similar to those for offensive tasks; however, normally the timeframe in which the tasks must be conducted is compressed. The only means for increasing the mobility of AHS units is to evacuate the patients they are holding. When it is anticipated that rapid shifts will occur in the OE, AHS units must evacuate patients from the potentially affected units to ensure their agility and to enhance their capacity for newly arriving patients. Table 4-3 (on page 4-9) depicts the defensive tasks, purposes, and key medical considerations when preparing for these types of tasks. Army Health System Operations 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 4-9 Table 4-3. Defensive tasks, purposes, and key medical considerations Defensive tasks Purposes Key medical considerations Mobile defense Area defense Retrograde Deter or defeat enemy offense. Gain time. Achieve economy of force. Retain key terrain. Protect the populace, critical assets, and infrastructure. Develop intelligence. All medical functions fully synchronized. Medical information management to document health threat exposures and medical encounters, to report health surveillance data and information on the health of the command, and to accomplish medical regulating and patient tracking operations. Emphasis is placed on the rapid acquisition, stabilization, and evacuation of patients generated by units in contact. This enhances the mobility of supporting Army Health System units and facilitates the commander’s ability to exploit opportunities and leverage the momentum to mount a counterattack or perform other maneuvers. Responsive medical logistics which facilitates and sustains the treatment of patients during the fight. Theater hospitalization to provide essential care in theater to all categories of patients. STABILITY TASKS 4-24. Stability is an overarching term encompassing various military missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the U.S. in coordination with other instruments of national power to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment, and provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and humanitarian relief. 4-25. The Army Medicine has historically conducted foreign humanitarian assistance operations when deployed in overseas areas. In some scenarios, medical forces may be deployed prior to the deployment of maneuver forces due to the humanitarian nature of their activities and medical personnel are more acceptable to a host nation than the deployment of the operational Army forces. 4-26. Although the medical commander can provide the CCDR assistance in planning for the primary stability tasks to restore essential services and support to economic and infrastructure development, the assistant chief of staff, CA is the responsible staff agency for developing and planning CA operations. This ensures that all stability activities conducted are in consonance with the CCDRs theater engagement strategy. 4-27. The importance of stability tasks in achieving U.S. national goals and objectives is discussed in DODD 3000.05, ADPs 3-0 and 3-07. Stability task considerations were included in the design of the MEDCOM (DS) which has CA officers assigned to the staff. The command maintains a regional focus on medical issues arising within the CCDRs AOR. 4-28. Table 4-4 (on page 4-10) depicts stability tasks, purposes, and key medical considerations for the preparation for the conduct of these tasks. Chapter 4 4-10 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Table 4-4. Stability tasks, purposes, and key medical considerations Stability tasks Purposes Key medical considerations Establish civil security (including security force assistance) Establish civil control Restore essential services Support to governance Support to economic and infrastructure development Conduct security cooperation Provide a secure environment. Secure land areas. Meet the critical needs of the populace. Gain support for host-nation government. Shape the environment for interagency and host-nation success. Regionally focused medical command and control to promote unity of purpose of all engaged medical assets. Medical information management to document health threat exposures and medical encounters, to report health surveillance data and information on the health of the command, and to accomplish medical regulating and patient tracking operations. Traditional medical support to a deployed force engaged in performing these tasks. Medical expertise and consultation to enhance building partnership capacity in public, private, and military health sectors of the host nation. Development of regional theater security cooperation plans aimed at mitigating or resolving the underlying causes of health issues prevalent within the region. DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES 4-29. Defense support of civil authorities is support provided by U.S. Federal military forces, DOD civilians, DOD contract personnel, DOD component assets, and National Guard forces (when the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Governors of the affected States, elects and requests to use those forces in Title 32, United States Code, status). This support is in response to requests for assistance from civil authorities for domestic emergencies, law enforcement support, and other domestic activities, or from qualifying entities for special events. Defense support of civil authorities is a task that takes place only in the homeland, although some of its tasks are similar to stability tasks. Table 4-5 identifies defense support of civil authorities, tasks, purposes, and key medical considerations. For additional information on these types of tasks, refer to ADP 3-28. Table 4-5. Defense support of civil authorities tasks, purposes, and key medical considerations Defense support of civil authorities task Purposes Key medical considerations Provide support for domestic disasters. Provide support for domestic chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear incidents. Provide support for domestic civilian law enforcement agencies. Provide other designated support. Save lives. Restore essential services. Maintain or restore law and order. Protect infrastructure and property. Maintain or restore local government. Shape the environment for interagency success. Coordinate, integrate, and synchronize Army Health System resources into the interagency efforts. Further, providing medical expertise to identify and analyze critical needs emerging within the operational area. Medical information management to facilitate medical regulating of victims to facilities outside of the disaster/incident site and to document medical treatment. Assist affected medical infrastructure in saving lives, reducing long-term disability, and alleviating human suffering. Assist the local government in conducting rescue operations and providing medical evacuation of victims to facilities capable of providing the required care. Preventive measures to respond to and resolve emerging health threats caused by the disaster/incident. Army Health System Operations 14 July 2022 FM 4-02, C1 4-11 4-30. ★Army Health System support to defense support of civil authorities tasks will include both AHS operational and the institutional AHS forces. The U.S. Army Medical Command retains command and control and provides both medical forces and medical capabilities in support of defense support of civil authorities tasks. As the Military Health System integrated combat support agency, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) enables the Services in providing this support. SECTION III — SETTING THE THEATER, THEATER OPENING, EARLY ENTRY, AND EXPEDITIONARY MEDICAL OPERATIONS 4-31. As the theater medical command, the MEDCOM (DS) maintains a regional focus that encompasses the GCC’s entire AOR and is critical for the successful provision of AHS support to set the theater. The medical commander’s ability to assess host-nation medical capability/capacity and the presence of health threats prevalent in the AOR, facilitates the planning and execution of regional strategies for establishment of the theater joint trauma system and mitigation of identified threats. 4-32. The MEDCOM (DS) provides the GCC an effective tool to assist in maximizing the use of scarce medical resources, shaping the security environment by building partner medical capacity, and alleviating health conditions that not only impact U.S. military forces, but multinational partners and particular challenges faced by the host nation. Efforts must also be made to understand the roles and responsibilities of all agencies involved (to include the Department of State, World Health Organization, partner nations, and others) for integration and synchronization of all medical capabilities in the region. 4-33. The MEDCOM (DS) also provides AHS support to set the theater through coordination, integration, and synchronization of strategic medical capabilities from the U.S. sustaining base, global health engagements, establishment and maintenance of medical support agreements, deploying medical technical expertise for consultation services and other support, military medical training exercises, as well as the following:  Executing AHS support to other Services when directed.  Ensuring adherence to eligibility criteria for treatment in U.S. military MTFs.  Recommending theater evacuation policy adjustments.  Providing theater food protection support.  Coordinating with USTRANSCOM for patient movement plans.  Coordinating with the theater signal command to support command and control and medical information system capabilities.  Establishing medical logistics capabilities necessary to support health services during early entry operations and ensure theater MEDLOG operations are connected to strategic enablers.  Ensuring integration and interoperability of theater medical capabilities.  Providing AHS support to foreign humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  Conducting medical preparation of the OE.  Maximizing use of host-nation medical capabilities.  Establishing and executing OEH surveillance programs and countermeasures.  Coordinating with the National Center for Medical Intelligence, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other strategic partners for identification and mitigation of regional health threats.  Planning and coordination for AHS support to—  Noncombatant evacuation operations.  Detainee operations.  Reception, staging, onward movement and integration and theater opening.  Large-scale casualty events and prolonged care.  Other Services. 4-34. ★Theater opening, early entry, and expeditionary medical operations require the AHS planner to develop flexible, agile, and comprehensive plans to provide effective and efficient AHS support in an austere environment. Many of the AHS forces deployed will be the organic medical assets of the maneuver forces Chapter 4 4-12 FM 4-02, C1 14 July 2022 conducting the operation; however, the MEDCOM (DS) (or other senior medical command in its absence such as the MEDBDE [SPT]), as the theater medical command will deploy sufficient medical resources to provide the required support. 4-35. Table 4-6 (page 4-13) provides an example of the types of AHS activities which may be conducted in these types of operations. THEATER OPENING AND EARLY ENTRY OPERATIONS 4-36.Theater opening operations involve two types of AHS forces: those organic to the maneuver force and those AHS organizations deployed to establish the initial medical infrastructure within the AOR and to support theater opening forces during reception, staging, onward movement, and integration. 4-37. The organic medical resources of the maneuver units provide Roles 1 and 2 AHS support to their parent organizations. While these organizations are at the port of debarkation/embarkation, operational assembly areas, or other in-transit locations, AHS support is provided on an area support basis by the AHS organizations supporting port operations. Army Health System units accompanying the intransit force normally do not unload and setup their medical equipment and supplies, but rather rely on area support to accomplish their immediate AHS support mission. 4-38. The focus of AHS support to theater opening operations is to establish a medical infrastructure which facilitates the smooth transition of incoming AHS assets, provides real-time HSS and FHP data (medical and OEH surveillance), health risk communications, subsistence inspection programs, and integrates medical materiel (supplies, blood, and equipment) requisition, distribution, and maintenance. 4-39. Intertheater USAF AE during theater opening operations may be delayed during initial entry with patients being held in the operational area for evacuation out of theater on airframes of opportunity. Evacuation at Roles 1 and 2 will be accomplished by organic air and ground evacuation assets. Forward resuscitative surgery assets will be critical to stabilize nontransportable patients. EXPEDITIONARY MEDICAL OPERATIONS 4-40. Expeditionary operations are operations that are inherently joint and require strategic reach. During crisis response, joint force commanders rely on contingency expeditionary forces to respond promptly. The Army provides ready forces able to operate in any environment- from urban areas to remote, rural regions. Health service support/FHP planning during expeditionary medical operations must remain flexible and coordinated, but it must also be adaptable to unique support arrangements (Table 4-6, page 4-13) which capitalize on the strengths of all units employed in the operational area. 4-41. Army Medicine personnel with an expeditionary and joint mindset have the confidence, skills, and knowledge to adapt and overcome unique medical challenges in providing a seamless continuum of care to our deployed forces. During expeditionary medical operations, units may be required to accomplish missions or coordinate support which they traditionally have not been required to accomplish. For example, the ability to project surgical resources into austere locations and the extended distances required to affect MEDEVAC may necessitate Role 2 MTFs and FSTs or FRSDs to coordinate directly with USAF aeromedical liaison teams and the supporting Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center for patient movement. 4-42. The array of AHS units in the current force was designed under three force design initiatives, Medical Force 2000, Medical Reengineering Initiative, and the Modular Force. Capabilities in like units under the three initiatives may vary, but the medical leadership can maximize and capitalize on the strengths of the various force designs, while minimizing the weaknesses to ensure the operational commander is provided the most effective and efficient AHS support. Army Health System Operations 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 4-13 Table 4-6. Example of Army Health System activities which may be conducted in theater opening and expeditionary medical operations Early Entry Modules Operational command post, medical command (deployment support), medical logistics management center team, medical logistics company (-), Roles 1 and 2 medical care, forward surgical team, combat support hospital (-), casualty prevention (operational public health, combat and operational stress control, and veterinary services), and medical evacuation. Theater-Level Capabilities Medical command (deployment support)/medical brigade, medical logistics management center team, medical logistics company, medical detachment (blood support) (-), Roles 1 and 2 medical care, operational dental support, forward surgical team, combat support hospital, casualty prevention (operational public health, combat and operational stress control, and veterinary services), medical evacuation (ground and air), and area medical laboratory services. Theater Opening Army Health System support during reception, staging, onward movement, and integration. Provide Roles 1 and 2 medical treatment on an area support basis for units without organic medical resources and/or units entering theater and deploying to other areas within an operational environment. Medical evacuation and/or casualty evacuation from point of injury to medical treatment facility based on availability of medical evacuation platforms. Intra/Intertheater  patient movement (between medical treatment facilities). Provide forward resuscitative surgery to stabilize nontransportable patients for evacuation out of theater. Emergency movement of Class VIII (to include blood), medical personnel, and medical equipment. Coordinate medical evacuation plan with the combat aviation brigade for air ambulance support. Coordinate with United States Air Force for strategic aeromedical evacuation and medical regulating. Manage patient movement items. Conduct medical and OEH surveillance. Conduct health risk assessment and communications. Provide Roles 1 and 2 veterinary treatment on an area support basis for military working dogs. Conduct subsistence inspections to ensure quality assurance, food safety, and food defense. Expeditionary Force rotation (reception, staging, onward movement, and integration). Roles 1 and 2 medical treatment on an area basis. Provide forward resuscitative surgery to stabilize nontransportable patients for evacuation out of theater. Medical and/or casualty evacuation from point of injury to medical treatment facility based on availability of medical evacuation platforms. Patient evacuation (between medical treatment facilities). Sustainment of Army Health System support operations (possible nontraditional sources of support from other Services, multinational forces, or host nation without habitual support relationships). Primary care. Tactical combat casualty care. Medical specialty care. Increased emphasis on liaison and coordination with nontraditional sources. Training prior to deployment as there is decreased time for in-country training. Adjustment of distribution channels may be required depending on source of support. Unit reconstitution may be accomplished using modular teams. Manage patient movement items. Care for detainees (increased requirements for operational public health support, primary care, care of chronic diseases/conditions). Casualty prevention measures to include medical and OEH surveillance. Veterinary support for the inspection of subsistence and the treatment of military working dogs. Coordination with United States Air Force for strategic aeromedical evacuation and medical regulating. 4-43. One of the keys to success in expeditionary medical operations is to ensure that support relationships are clearly defined in the OPLAN and OPORD. The medical commander must be cognizant of the various types of support relationships defined in ADP 5-0 to facilitate the seamless provision of health care. Another Chapter 4 4-14 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 key to the successful accomplishment of the AHS mission is the synchronization of health care activities through medical command and control and the technical supervision of ongoing clinical operations. Medical command and control provides a conduit to obtain reachback medical technical support during early entry and expeditionary operations conducted in austere environments prior to deployment of some medical specialty care assets. SECTION IV — SUPPORT TO DETAINEE OPERATIONS 4-44. It is DOD policy that the U.S. military Services shall comply with the principles, spirit, and intent of the international law of war, both customary and codified, to include the Geneva Conventions. As such, captured or detained personnel will be accorded an appropriate legal status under international law and conventions. Personnel in U.S. custody will receive medical care consistent with the standard of medical care that applies for U.S. military personnel in the same geographic area. See DODD 2310.01E, DODD 2311.01, DODI 2310.08E, JP 3-63, JP 4-02, AR 40-400, AR 190-8, and FM 6-27/MCTP 11-10C. 4-45. The focus of AHS support to detainee operations is depicted in Table 4-7.

Any medications the detainee has when detained are collected, tagged, and identified and provided to medical personnel. Medications are dispensed by medical personnel. 3 Detainees whose medical condition is such that they must be moved to a medical treatment facility for medical care will be evacuated through medical channels. The echelon commander must provide guards for all detainees evacuated through medical channels. Army Health System Operations 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 4-15 MEDICAL PERSONNEL ORGANIC TO MANEUVER UNITS 4-46. Medical personnel organic to maneuver units may be required to provide TCCC, area medical support, and MEDEVAC at the point of contact/injury and to temporary concentrations of detainees at detainee collection points and detainee holding areas. In early-entry operations, the senior medical officer (brigade surgeon) serves as the detainee operations medical director until follow-on forces are deployed and a detainee operations medical director is designated for the AO. 4-47. The medical resources required to support detainee operations are task-organized based on mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations. The detainee operations medical director determines the medical support requirements and develops and provides technical guidance for all medical resources engaged in detainee medical operations. This guidance is directed to appropriate medical personnel through their technical channels. 4-48. The detainee operations medical director is normally designated by the MEDCOM (DS) commander to develop and provide technical guidance on the medical aspects of detainee operations conducted throughout the operational area. Technical guidance is exercised throughout all echelons of medical channels and affects all medical personnel and units delivering health care to detainee populations. Technical guidance encompasses—  All medical services provided at detainee collection points and detainee holding areas, to include limited medical screening, TCCC, personnel protective measures (hygiene and sanitation), and MEDEVAC of seriously injured or ill detainees. The echelon commander must provide guards and/or escorts when detainees are evacuated through medical channels; medical personnel cannot perform guard functions.  All medical services provided in the detention facility, to include:  Initial medical examinations.  Medical treatment (routine care, sick call, emergency services, hospitalization, medical consultation, and specialty care requirements).  Medical evacuation.  Operational public health (such as medical surveillance, OEH surveillance, hygiene and sanitation standards and practices, pest management activities, and inspection of water portability, dining facility and services hygiene, and food preparation practices).  Dental services.  Veterinary support (food inspection and quality assurance, veterinary public health, and animal medical care).  Behavioral health care.  Neuropsychiatric treatment and stress prevention, as required.  Medical logistics (such as medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and medical equipment maintenance and repair, blood management, and optical lens fabrication).  Medical laboratory support.  All medical services provided in U.S. military MTFs which are not part of established detention facilities. This can include TCCC by combat medics and provided at battalion aid stations and Role 2 MTFs (medical companies) and forward resuscitative surgery provided by FSTs or FRSDs to stabilize the patient for further evacuation and hospitalization. Resuscitative care is tactical combat casualty care and surgery limited to the minimum required to stabilize a patient for transportation to a higher role of care while forward resuscitative surgery refers to urgent initial surgery required to render a patient transportable for further evacuation to a MTF staffed and equipped to provide for the patient's care.  All medical administrative matters such as the establishment and maintenance of medical records, documentation of preexisting injuries (to include medical photography, if deemed appropriate), restrictions on activities based on medical conditions (similar to medical profiles), and documentation required for legal purposes (such as monthly height and weight records). Chapter 4 4-16 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Note. All documentation pertaining to detainees must be identified with either the capture tag number or the detainee’s internment serial number.  Procedural guides and SOPs that are developed and disseminated for reporting suspected detainee abuse. Medical personnel are trained on procedures to identify injuries resulting from abuse and the ethical considerations of treating personnel with suspected abuse.  Procedural guides and SOPs that are developed to standardize the credentialing of health care providers, to define the scope of practice of medical personnel, and to establish the scope of practice for retained medical personnel.  Standards of medical care throughout detention facilities within the AO that are established, inspected, and enforced (the standards used are the same as those for United States Armed Forces).  Procedures that are established and disseminated for identifying, reporting, and resolving medical ethics and other legal issues.  Procedures that are established for ensuring medical proficiencies and competencies, identifying deficiencies, and providing required training to resolve deficiencies.  Programs of instruction that are developed to ensure that all medical personnel engaged in detainee health care have appropriate orientation and training in the detainee’s culture, language (and/or linguist support), social order, and religion. MEDICAL PERSONNEL ORGANIC TO MILITARY POLICE UNITS 4-49. The military police detention battalion has organic medical personnel to provide a limited Role 1 medical care capability and operational public health services within the detention facility. When a detainee operations medical director has been designated within the AO, these medical personnel are under the technical guidance of the detainee operations medical director. 4-50. The medical personnel assigned to the military police detention battalion assist with in processing detainees by providing the initial medical examination. They provide routine sick call services and TCCC and coordinate with the supporting AHS units for Role 2 and above care. They maintain medical records, to include DA Form 2664-R (Weight Register). When the supporting AHS unit is collocated with the detention facility, the unit’s scope of practice, schedule, and duty assignments are coordinated through the supporting AHS unit. ARMY HEALTH SYSTEM UNITS IN SUPPORT OF DETAINEE OPERATIONS 4-51. The MEDCOM (DS) theater medical command and is the senior AHS medical command and control organization within the AOR. The MEDCOM (DS) is responsible for ensuring that the medical care provided to detainees and other personnel in U.S. custody is provided in compliance with international and U.S. law and military policies and regulatory guidance. The MEDCOM (DS) plans for and coordinates support for detention facilities located within CCDR’s AOR. The MEDBDE (SPT) coordinates medical issues related to detainee operations being conducted by subordinate units with the MEDCOM (DS) detainee operations medical director. 4-52. The MEDCOM (DS) commander or the commander’s designee (normally the deputy commander, professional services) serves as the detainee operations medical director and provides oversight, guidance, and policy on medical ethics issues, standards and availability of care, requirements for field hygiene and sanitation, nutrition and maintenance of weigh-in registers, and all other medical aspects of confinement health care. 4-53. The MEDBDE (SPT) coordinates medical issues related to detainee operations being conducted by subordinate units with the MEDCOM (DS) detainee operations medical director.17 November 2020 FM 4-02 5-1 PART TWO Force Health Protection The mission sets of the Army Medicine (which historically had been shown under the combat service support battlefield operating system) are under two warfighting functions- the protection and sustainment warfighting functions. This change more closely aligned the Army Medicine mission sets with the overall warfighting functions of the Army. The FHP mission is discussed in Part Two of this publication, while the HSS mission is discussed in Part Three. Although Parts Two and Three discuss the mission sets as separate entities, the medical personnel and staffs that plan, coordinate, and synchronize these operations are responsible for the execution of both mission sets. These interrelated and interdependent medical functions are complex in nature and require medical command and control for synchronization and integration. This ensures the interrelationships and interoperability of all medical assets and optimizes the effective functioning of the entire AHS system. Force Health Protection is a continuous process that begins with the Soldier’s entry into the military and is continuous throughout the Soldier’s military career. Force health protection includes establishing and sustaining a healthy and fit force, health promotion and nutrition programs, the identification of the health threat in all settings (in both deployed and garrison settings), the development and implementation of personnel protective measures to reduce exposure to health hazards and mitigating the adverse effects of the impact of health threats to military personnel. Force health protection are measures that promote, improve, or conserve the behavioral and physical well-being of Soldiers comprised of preventive and treatment aspects of medical functions that include: combat and operational stress control, dental services, veterinary services, operational public health, and laboratory services. Enabling a healthy and fit force, prevent injury and illness, and protect the force from health hazards. Although nutrition plays a significant role in maintaining a healthy and fit force, nutrition is discussed as an integral part of the hospitalization function under the HSS mission. Chapter 5 Operational Public Health Public Health is the science and practice of promoting, protecting, improving, and, when necessary, restoring the health of individuals, specified groups, or the entire population. As applied in the operational setting it is the preservation, maintenance, and restoration of health in Army populations through the anticipation, prediction, identification, surveillance, evaluation, prevention, and control of DNBI. (AR 40-5) Public Health encompasses a wide range of capabilities, organizations, and professional disciplines operating in a systematic manner to effectively execute the 10 Chapter 5 5-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Essential Public Health Services. It is a major enabler for Army readiness and a major component of force health protection in its application throughout all Army activities. Levels of readiness and health in all Army populations are enhanced and sustained by applying the principles of public health to promote healthy behaviors and to prevent and minimize the impacts of diseases and injuries. According to the recent published AR 40-5 (May 2020), field preventive medicine is no longer a valid term. The term operational public health is now the term to describe the application of Public Health practices and conduct of Public Health-related activities within a geographic area where military operations are conducted by TOE units (AR 40-5). Examples of military operations include training and exercises conducted in field environments or locations outside of a permanent U.S. military installation, humanitarian support, contingency operations, and combat or stability operations. When emphasized by commanders and unit leaders, operational public health can effectively reduce and prevent DNBI and maximize the fighting strength of the force. For more information regarding Public Health Program and operational public health, refer to AR 40-5. MISSION 5-1. The FHP mission set is a continuous process that begins with the entry of the Soldier into the military and is continuous throughout the Soldier’s military career. Force health protection includes those measures designed to promote, improve, or conserve the behavioral and physical well-being of Army personnel across the full range of military activities and operations. The successful employment of FHP activities enables a healthy and fit force, prevents injury and illness, and protects the force from health hazards. PROTECTION WARFIGHTING FUNCTION 5-2. Operational public health falls under the protection warfighting function and is concerned with both the enemy threat and the health threat. The enemy threat produces operational casualties. It depends on the types of weapons used, the will of the enemy to fight, and other operational concerns. The health threat consists of diseases, OEH hazards, poisonous or toxic flora and fauna, medical effects of weapons, and physiological and psychological stressors. To counter the health threat and sustain health readiness, the following garrison-based public health activities must be considered in an operational setting:  health surveillance, OEH surveillance and OEH risk management, disease vectors and pest management, food protection, water management, waste management, operational hearing services, health promotion, and heat, cold, and altitude (climatic injury prevention). 5-3. The success of operational public health requires deliberate and consistent analysis and communication of health threats to inform individuals, and the implementation and enforcement of unit and individual countermeasures (for example, exposure controls, chemoprophylaxis, and immunizations) required to reduce associated health risks. Commanders and unit leaders must remain informed and proactively engaged to ensure the health of the Force; reduce health threats, stressors, and risks; and promote all available countermeasures. ORGANIZATIONS AND PERSONNEL 5-4. Operational public health support is provided by preventive medicine units and staff officers. Preventive medicine detachments and teams provide operational public health support and consultation in the areas of health surveillance (inclusive of medical and DNBI surveillance), OEH surveillance (inclusive of OEH risk management and site assessments), disease vectors and pest management, water management, food protection, waste management, operational hearing services, and field hygiene and sanitation (inclusive of climatic injury prevention). Echelons above brigade staff support consists of preventive medicine staff officers organic to the MEDCOM (DS), MEDBDE (SPT), and MMB. These staff officers serve as the commander’s principal public health consultants and environmental sciences and engineer advisors.

The Secretary of the Air Force provides the food inspection program at Air Force bases and may develop locally approved lists of food suppliers from which food products are procured only for individual Air Force installations. 6-4. Appropriate veterinary units provide this support. These units can be task-organized to support food protection, food protection (food safety and food defense), quality assurance, and/or the medical care mission for military and contract working dogs, and other government-owned animals. The food protection mission includes food safety, food defense, and quality assurance inspection and surveillance activities associated with food sources, distribution, warehousing, bulk storage, food quality, food vulnerability, and food and water risk assessment. The United States Army Veterinary Service is responsible for publishing a directory of approved food sources for the AO. Veterinary public health reduces transmission of zoonotic diseases; monitors, assesses, and mitigates endemic animal disease threats to working animals and CONUS agricultural systems; monitors animals as sentinels of threats to humans or other animals by investigating unexplained animal deaths. It is an effective combat multiplier through monitoring endemic animal disease threats of military significance and zoonotic disease threats to Service members. The animal medical care mission provides comprehensive medical and surgical care for MWDs, other government-owned animals, contract working dogs, and other animals authorized care in the AO. The potential of foodborne disease, the threat of CBRN contamination of subsistence, the need to assess and mitigate the zoonotic and endemic animal disease threat, and the need to provide animal medical care to working dogs requires a veterinary presence throughout the entire operational area. Comprehensive veterinary medical and surgical programs are required to provide casualty care for and maintain the health of military and contract working dogs in order to optimize their detection and patrol capabilities to protect the Service members. Refer to Table 6-1 for primary tasks and purposes of veterinary services. Table 6-1. Primary tasks and purposes of veterinary services Primary task Purpose Provide animal medical care ­ Provide veterinary medical care for military and contract working dogs and other government owned animals. Conduct food protection activities ­ Ensure quality, food safety, food defense of food sources and storage areas to ensure wholesome food supply for deployed forces. Execute veterinary public health activities ­ Reduce transmission of zoonotic disease threats to deployed forces and mitigate the impact of animal diseases of operational importance to working animals or continental U.S. agricultural systems.Veterinary Services 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 6-3 SECTION II — FOOD PROTECTION MISSION 6-5. The food protection mission ensures quality, food safety, and food defense of food sources and food storage areas for deployed sources to minimize foodborne illness threats. It encompasses all services performed to include:  Conducting food protection sanitation audits of commercial food establishments, including storage facilities for DOD procurement.  Conducting military sanitary inspections at all food establishments on military installations.  Conducting contingency CBRN surveillance of potentially contaminated subsistence, as directed/required and providing guidance on the disposition of CBRN-contaminated subsistence.  Providing CBRN decontamination instructions for subsistence.  Conducting surveillance and receipt inspections of operational rations and other government- owned subsistence intended for consumption or use by DOD personnel.  Providing basic food microbiological and chemical surveillance of the military food supply (to include performing rapid, presumptive laboratory testing [screening and surveillance] for microbial contaminants, pesticides and toxins, and field confirmatory testing for microbial contaminants in the food supply).  Providing assessment and guidance on temperature-abused foods.  Conducting routine inspections of government food storage facilities.  Participating in foreign humanitarian assistance and other stability tasks as directed.  Providing food surveillance inspections of dining facilities for security and storage of food products.  Assisting in foodborne illness investigations.  Conducting food and water risk assessments. SECTION III — ANIMAL CARE MISSION 6-6. The animal care mission provides comprehensive medical and surgical care for MWDs and for government-owned animals to optimize performance and protect Service members from enemy threats. It provides preventive and casualty care as authorized for other animals eligible for United States Army- provided veterinary care. The animal care mission is discussed in a similar fashion as are the roles of medical care used to describe the successive and increasing capabilities to provide care to our injured and wounded Service members. The major difference is there are no veterinary assets in the BCT. The majority of veterinary assets in the operational area are assigned to EAB veterinary units and must be projected forward to provide care in the brigade area. Note. Non-veterinary health care providers should only perform medical or surgical procedures consistent with their medical training and necessary to manage problems for working animals that immediately threaten life, limb, or eyesight, and to prepare the working dog for evacuation to a facility that has a veterinary provider. Non-veterinary health care providers should refer to the Joint Trauma System clinical practice guidelines for MWDs (http://jts.amedd.army.mil/index.cfm/PI_CPGs/cpgs) and consult with their local military veterinary providers. 6-7. Veterinary treatment in a deployed environment consists of veterinary Roles 1 through 3 veterinary treatment support. Treatment is provided by supporting Medical Detachments (Veterinary Service Support) on an area support basis. No organic veterinary personnel are located in the BCT. 6-8. Table 6-2 on page 6-4 discusses the primary tasks and purposes of veterinary services treatment. Chapter 6 6-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Table 6-2. Primary tasks and purposes of veterinary services treatment Primary task Purpose Provide preventive care Maintenance of health to optimize working dog detection and patrol capability to detect threats to Service members. Conduct sick call Treatment of routine DNBI and noncombat related emergencies as close to the working dog’s unit as possible to minimize lost working days. Perform K9 tactical combat casualty care Provision of lifesaving stabilization and care as close to the working dog’s point of injury as possible to maximize survival rates. Perform resuscitation and emergency surgical stabilization Provision of resuscitative surgical care on an area support basis to maximize survival rates. Provide hospitalization services Provision of short-term hospitalization capability (not to exceed 72 hours) for military and contract working dogs requiring direct veterinary care to reduce medical evacuation and maximize return to duty rates. Support medical evacuation In order to maximize survival rates of working dogs during medical evacuation to higher roles of care, veterinary personnel may be required to augment standard medical personnel and be allowed access to working dog patients en route. VETERINARY ROLE 1 MEDICAL CARE 6-9. This role of veterinary medical care is provided by the animal’s handler and the animal care specialist. ANIMAL HANDLER 6-10. Non-veterinary personnel, such as MWD, equestrian, livestock, and/or USN marine mammal handlers perform limited lifesaving and first aid procedures until an animal care specialist or a veterinarian is available. This paragraph details handler-provided capabilities for MWDs since they are most likely to be encountered within the AHS. Qualified MWD handlers from all Services provide emergency medical care to their dogs in three specific areas of concentration: K9TCCC, noncombat emergency care, and preventive medical care. Tasks reflect current practices based on experience with MWDs injured in combat operations. Tasks reflect the most current scope of practice for medical care of MWDs by handlers, and focus on tasks that are most critical to preservation of life, limb, and eyesight of working dogs. Handlers are trained to provide the most effective immediate care to prevent further injury, reduce effects of trauma and illness, and stabilize the patient while coordinating rapid evacuation. In conjunction with the tasks and training focus, each handler has a MWD Handler First Aid Set, which is compartmentalized to ensure the exact medical supplies needed to perform every task are available. Following appropriate emergency veterinary medical training provided by a veterinarian, a MWD handler has the following capabilities:  Perform rapid evaluation of a MWD and application of a muzzle for safety.  Provide immediate control of hemorrhage.  Manage the airway (airway obstruction, tracheal intubation, surgical tracheostomy).  Manage breathing (airway obstruction, open chest wound and tension/closed pneumothorax).  Manage circulation via intravenous access and fluid resuscitation for shock.  Prevent and manage hypothermia.  Bandage open wounds including abdominal wounds.  Manage heat trauma.  Manage eye trauma or irritation.  Provide analgesia.  Initiate infection control (wound lavage, antibiotic therapy).  Manage burn injuries or wound.  Splint distal extremity fracture. Veterinary Services 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 6-5  Perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. ANIMAL CARE SPECIALIST 6-11. Animal care specialists are organic to Army engineer, Ranger, USN, and Medical Detachment (Veterinary Service Support) units. The animal care specialist supervises or provides the care, management, treatment, and sanitary conditions for animals, with a primary responsibility for the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases and comprehensive care for government-owned animals. 6-12. Animal Care Specialists can perform the same tasks as the Animal Handler plus the following capabilities:  Calculating doses and administering oral and topical medications as directed by the veterinarian or established protocol approved by a veterinarian.  Maintaining sanitary conditions for all components of the veterinary facility.  Cleaning, debriding, and suturing superficial wounds.  Collecting, preserving, and preparing postmortem specimens (including rabies suspect specimens) for shipment and evaluation at the appropriate laboratory.  Coordinating and stabilizing MWDs, equids, and marine mammals for evacuation to veterinary field unit or treatment facility.  Performing serial monitoring of vital signs and reporting patient’s clinical status to the veterinarian.  Collecting laboratory specimens (blood, urine, feces, skin scraping) and performing routine diagnostics (chemistry, complete blood count, urinalysis); handling and shipping of samples to diagnostic laboratories.  Conducting minor sick call or emergency procedures under the indirect supervision of a veterinarian (such as teleconsultation or preauthorized protocol). Treatment may include restoring the airway by invasive procedures; use of intravenous fluids and medications; and applying splints, bandages, and tourniquets.  Preventing and managing DNBI (such as heat/cold injuries, gastric dilatation volvulus [bloat], arthropod/reptile bites/stings, vomiting/diarrhea, and so forth).  Performing humane euthanasia when instructed by veterinarian.  Performing advanced lifesaving measures to include triage, tracheotomy, burn and poison management, venous cutdown, insertion of stomach tubes, gastric trocharization, establishing and maintaining the airway, controlling hemorrhage, performing first aid for hypovolemic shock, and splinting or immobilizing fractures.  Inducing and maintaining general anesthesia (under the supervision of a veterinarian), operating mechanical ventilators, and monitoring anesthetized patient status.  Taking radiographs and reviewing images for proper positioning.  Initiating and maintaining patient medical records. 6-13. Veterinary Role 1 care is provided by the animal care handler, animal care specialist, and veterinarian assigned individually to various United States Army, United States Air Force, United States Marine Corps, or United States Navy field units or Veterinary Service Support Teams. Either the animal care specialist or veterinarian will respond to the emergency call of a MWD, equid, or USN marine mammal handler. Depending on the type of emergency, the animal care specialist or veterinarian will evaluate the traumatized or ill animal to provide stabilization with basic first aid equipment or medications so that the patient can withstand further evacuation to and treatment by either a forward-deployed veterinary Role 2 Veterinary Service Support Team, veterinary Role 3 Veterinary Medical and Surgical Team, or veterinary Role 4 care at an Army veterinary hospital. An animal handler can be instructed to perform basic emergency aid procedures and prepare the animal for transport/evacuation to a higher role of veterinary medical care in the event the animal care specialist or veterinarian cannot provide veterinary Role 1 care at the POI/illness. Chapter 6 6-6 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Note. Injured or ill MWDs may be evacuated on any transportation means available. The using unit is responsible for the evacuation of the animal. Use of dedicated MEDEVAC assets (air or ground ambulances) is authorized based on mission priority and availability. When possible, the handler should accompany the animal during the evacuation. Using units should include the location of veterinary treatment facility/support units on mission request. Refer to ATP 4-02.2 for more information. VETERINARY ROLE 2 MEDICAL CARE 6-14. Veterinary Role 2 medical care is provided by a forward-deployed Veterinary Service Support Team veterinarian and an animal care specialist from the Medical Detachment (Veterinary Service Support). This level of care includes veterinarian-directed resuscitation and stabilization and may include K9TCCC, emergency medical procedures, and forward emergency resuscitative surgery for military or contract working dogs, other government owned animals such as equids and USN marine mammals. A Veterinary Service Support Team provides veterinary Role 2 support for up to 50 military or contract working dogs. There are five Veterinary Service Support Teams in a Medical Detachment (Veterinary Service Support), which are geographically dispersed throughout the operational area. 6-15. Veterinary Role 2 medical care includes:  Basic veterinary clinical laboratory- microscopic examination, complete blood count, blood chemistry, and urinalysis.  Limited veterinary pharmacy.  Limited temporary MWD holding facilities for basic medical disease treatment.  Sick call.  Routine preventive care.  Nonemergent surgical care.  Emergency medical and limited emergency surgical procedures.  Ultrasound.  Limited care for large animals under certain conditions of government interest for stability tasks and defense support of civil authorities tasks.  Endemic zoonotic and foreign animal disease epidemiology surveillance and control by examination of local farm animals in the area, captured wildlife, and stray animals. 6-16. Veterinary patients are treated and returned to duty or are stabilized for transport/evacuation to a higher veterinary role of medical care. At veterinary Role 2 no organic patient holding capability is available. Note. There are no kennels at veterinary Role 2. The MWD handler is expected to stay with his dog. Each MWD handler has a crate for his dog. Dogs can sleep or rest in their crate on the ground. The horse or USN marine mammal handler is also expected to stay with his animal. VETERINARY ROLE 3 MEDICAL CARE 6-17. This role of veterinary medical care is provided by the Veterinary Medical and Surgical Team which consists of a clinical and surgical team designed to care for dogs only. No veterinary Role 3 capability is available in the operational area for horses or USN marine mammals. If veterinary Role 3 care is required, the horses, livestock, or USN marine mammals may be transported/evacuated back to CONUS. 6-18. Veterinary Role 3 medical care includes referral for veterinary diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical procedures, and requires advanced clinical capabilities. At veterinary Role 3, capability exists to provide veterinary Role 1 and 2 care for up to 50 military or contract working dogs, and veterinary Role 3 care for a catchment population of up to 300 military or contract working dogs provided five Veterinary Service Support Teams are deployed in support to provide veterinary Role 1 and 2 care. There is one Veterinary Medical and Surgical Team per Medical Detachment (Veterinary Service Support). Veterinary Services 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 6-7 6-19. Veterinary Role 3 medical care capabilities include:  Patient case consultation and acceptance of referrals.  Comprehensive canine veterinary medical/surgical care (such as orthopedic and extensive soft tissue surgeries).  Extensive veterinary laboratory capabilities- complete blood count, chemistry, and urinalysis.  Robust veterinary pharmacy.  Diagnostic imaging (radiographs and ultrasound).  Definitive and restorative MWD dental care to include endodontic procedures.  Area of operations-wide patient tracking of MWD to include evacuation.  Established operational area MWD evacuation policy and standards of care.  Training for unit veterinarians and animal care specialist as well as institutional veterinary training programs, ranging from university hospitals to local veterinary technician training, for stability tasks.  Development of the detachment’s policies for care of government-owned animals.  Treatment, return to duty, or hospitalization of military or contract working dogs for continued care or stabilization of MWDs for transport/evacuation to veterinary Role 4 medical care. 6-20. The Veterinary Medical and Surgical Team is staffed and equipped to hospitalize up to five military or contract working dogs. VETERINARY ROLE 4 MEDICAL CARE 6-21. Veterinary Role 4 medical care is found in CONUS at the DOD Military Working Dog Veterinary Service and outside CONUS at the Veterinary Medical Center Europe. Veterinary Role 4 medical care expands the capabilities available at veterinary Roles 1 through 3 and provides additional specialized veterinary medical and surgical care, rehabilitative therapy, and convalescent capability. SECTION IV — VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH 6-22.Veterinary public health includes preventing and mitigating the effects of foodborne disease; reducing the transmission of zoonotic diseases; monitoring, assessing, and mitigating endemic animal disease threats to working animals and CONUS agricultural systems; and  monitoring animals as sentinels of threats to humans or other animals by investigating unexplained animal deaths. Using the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s regulations or the regulations for other countries (depending on the equipment’s final destination), veterinary services also assists with decontamination guidance for U.S.-owned equipment being retrograded to CONUS and other nations to prevent the transmission of animal diseases as well as advises the commander on foreign animal disease that may affect redeployment of military equipment back to the U.S. Specific services include:  Support for prevention and control programs to protect Service members from foodborne diseases.  Evaluation of zoonotic disease data collected in the AO and advice to preventive medicine elements, patient treatment elements, and higher headquarters on potential hazards to humans.  Establishment of animal disease prevention and control programs to protect Service members and other DOD and multinational personnel from zoonotic diseases.  Assessment of the presence of animal diseases that may impact the CONUS agriculture system if contaminated equipment or personnel are allowed to redeploy.  Investigation of unexplained animal deaths to include livestock and wildlife to detect any threats to Service members, working animals, or U.S. agricultural systems.  Establishment of animal disease prevention and control programs to protect military working animals from infectious diseases.  Technical consultation for zoonotic disease and pest control programs such as rabies advisory boards and feral animal risk mitigation. For more information on feral animal risk mitigation, see Armed Forces Pest Management Board Technical Guide No. 3, Feral Animal Risk Mitigation in Operational Areas. Chapter 6 6-8 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 6-23. For more information on Veterinary Services, refer to AR 40-3, AR 40-5, DA PAM 40-11, AR 40- 905, ATP 4-02.8, and ATP 4-02.7. 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 7-1 Chapter 7 Combat and Operational Stress Control Combat and operational stress control has always been a commander’s program. To be successful, commanders must fully understand and appreciate the magnitude of a potentially traumatic event as it affects exposed organizations and individuals. It is a harsh reality that combat and operational stress affects everyone engaged in unified land operations. It should be viewed as a continuum of possible outcomes that each person will experience with a range from positive growth behaviors to negative and sometimes disruptive reactions. Effective leadership shapes the experience that they and their Soldiers go through in an effort to successfully transition units and individuals, build resilience and promote posttraumatic growth, or increased functioning and positive change after enduring trauma. Combat and operational stress control does not take away the experiences faced while engaged in military operations, it attempts to mitigate those experiences so that Soldiers and units remain combat- effective and ultimately provide the support and meaning that will allow Soldiers to maintain the quality of life to which they are entitled. SECTION I — COMBAT AND OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES 7-1. Combat and operational stress control is a program developed and actions taken by military leadership to prevent, identify, and manage adverse combat and operational stress reactions in units. This medical function optimizes mission performance; conserves the fighting strength; and prevents or minimizes adverse effects of combat and operational stress reaction on Soldiers and their physical, psychological, intellectual, and social health. Its goal is to return Soldiers to duty expeditiously. SECTION II — PROGRAM AND RESOURCES 7-2. According to DODD 6490.02E, COSC activities include routine screening of individuals when recruited; continued surveillance throughout military service, especially before, during, and after deployment; and continual assessment and consultation with medical and other personnel from garrison to the battlefield. Soldiers who are temporarily impaired or incapacitated with stress-related conditions are diagnosed as BH disorders. Combat and operational stress control promotes Soldier and unit readiness by―  Enhancing adaptive stress reactions.  Preventing maladaptive stress reactions.  Assisting Soldiers with controlling combat and operational stress reactions.  Assisting Soldiers with behavioral disorders.  Teaching warrior resiliency skills. 7-3. For more information on COSC, refer to ATP 4-02.5 and ATP 4-02.8. BRIGADE COMBAT TEAMS 7-4. In the BCTs, COSC support is provided by mental health sections assigned to the brigade support medical company of the brigade support battalion. If required, these resources can receive direct support from the BH personnel assigned to the medical detachment (COSC), if augmentation is required. Chapter 7 7-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 MEDICAL COMPANY (AREA SUPPORT) 7-5. At EAB, mental health sections are assigned to the medical companies (area support) that are normally assigned to the MMB. If required, these resources can be augmented with BH personnel assigned to the medical detachment (COSC). MEDICAL DETACHMENT, COMBAT AND OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL 7-6. A medical detachment (COSC) is usually assigned to the MMB and provides direct support to the EAB. In support of an AO, this unit provides support on an area basis and provides additional support to the BCT as required. The medical detachment (COSC) consists of a detachment headquarters, a main support section, a Unit Ministry Team, and a forward support section. The main support section consists of its headquarters and an 18-Soldier BH team made up of social workers, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, occupational therapists, psychiatric nurses, BH specialists, and occupational therapy specialist. The forward support section consists of an 18-Soldier BH team. Each BH team is capable of breaking into six 3-person subteams, for battalion/company prevention and fitness support activities. This provides for a total of 12 subteams for each detachment, giving supported commanders more teams and more flexibility in the utilization of those teams. PRIMARY TASKS 7-7. Table 7-1 discusses the primary tasks of the COSC function. Table 7-2 (on page 7-3) discusses the primary tasks and purposes of BH/neuropsychiatric treatment. Table 7-1. Primary tasks and purposes of the combat and operational stress control function Primary task Purpose Implement combat and operational stress control plan/program Prevent combat and operational stress reaction. Perform combat and operational stress control unit needs assessment Provide command with global assessment of the unit, with considerations of multiple variables that may affect leadership, performance, morale, and operational effectiveness of the organization. Conduct traumatic event management for potentially traumatic event Assist in the transition of units and Soldiers who are exposed to potentially traumatic events by building resilience, promoting posttraumatic growth, and/or increasing functioning and positive changes in the unit. Screen and evaluate Soldiers with maladaptive behaviors to rule out neuropsychiatric/behavioral health conditions Provide diagnosis, treatment, and disposition for Soldiers with neuropsychiatric/behavioral problems. Conduct combat and operational stress restoration and reconditioning programs to include warrior resiliency training Provide Soldiers rest/restoration within or near their unit area for rapid return to duty and to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder. Perform command-directed evaluation for Soldier’s behavioral health status Determine if Soldiers’ mental state renders them at risk to themselves or others or may affect their ability to carry out their mission. Screen patients with potential behavioral health issues for signs/symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury Rule out mild traumatic brain injury for Soldiers seeking assistance with behavioral health issues. If appropriate, refer individuals for follow-up medical examination. Combat and Operational Stress Control 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 7-3 SECTION III — BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND NEUROPSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT ASPECTS 7-8. Behavioral health/neuropsychiatric treatment exists when there is an explicit therapist-patient or therapist-client relationship. TREATMENT PROVISION 7-9. Behavioral health/neuropsychiatric treatment is provided for Soldiers with behavioral disorders to sustain them on duty or to stabilize them for referral/transfer. This is usually a brief, time-limited treatment as dictated by the operational situation. Behavioral health/neuropsychiatric treatment includes counseling, psychotherapy, and behavior therapy, occupational therapy, and medication therapy. Treatment assumes an ongoing process of evaluation and may include assessment modalities such as psychometric testing, neuropsychological testing, laboratory and radiological examination, and COSC providers’ discipline- specific evaluations. 7-10. Behavioral health/neuropsychiatric treatment is provided to Soldiers with diagnosed behavioral disorders and who require more intentions for their diagnoses. It is both inappropriate and detrimental to treat Soldiers with combat and operational stress reactions as if they are behavioral health disorder. A therapeutic relationship may promote dependency and foster the patient role. Likewise, medication therapy and the highly structured treatment modalities imply the patient role. Medication for transient symptom relief (insomnia or extreme anxiety) may not be detrimental if there is no expectation that medication will continue to be prescribed. 7-11. Treatment standards are the same in the deployed environment as in garrison. When operational requirements dictate that clinical standards of treatment/care are waived or relaxed, it must be approved by the AO COSC consultant. Treatment should be tailored to the anticipated availability of the Soldier and the COSC provider. Short-term interventions are more practical than long-term commitments. If longer-term treatment is necessary, design the intervention in time-limited modules. Under no circumstances should treatment diminish the Soldier’s ability to provide self-care and to defend himself. Exceptions include emergency stabilization and preparation for evacuation. In addition, the Department of Veterans Affairs/DOD Clinical Practice Guidelines website offers clinicians evidence-based assessment and treatment algorithms for acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and many other behavioral/neuropsychiatric disorders. PRIMARY TASKS 7-12. Table 7-2 discusses the primary tasks and purposes of BH/neuropsychiatric treatment. Table 7-2. Primary tasks and purposes of behavioral health/neuropsychiatric treatment Primary task Purpose Identify and diagnose behavioral health/neuropsychiatric disorder/ disease ­ Identify and initiate treatment for patients with behavioral health/ neuropsychiatric disease processes. Stabilize patient ­ Stabilize behavioral health/neuropsychiatric patients for evacuation from the theater for treatment of disease process in the continental United States-support base.

As such, the Soldier’s health and physical fitness are vitally important. Equally important is the Soldier’s oral and dental health, which if not properly maintained can result in becoming nondeployable, and if already deployed, can render this Soldier nonmission-capable. SECTION I — DENTAL SERVICES PREVENTIVE DENTISTRY 8-1. Preventive dentistry incorporates primary, secondary, and tertiary preventive measures. For more information on dental services, refer to AR 40-35 and ATP 4-02.19. PREVENTIVE MEASURES 8-2. Preventive dentistry measures can effectively prevent the development of tooth decay and oral disease. The application of fluoride and sealants combined with regular dental checkups and oral screenings can prevent tooth decay and identify oral disease at its most treatable stages. Therefore, Soldiers who incorporate good preventive dental hygiene practices are far less likely to become dental casualties due to disease while deployed. PRIMARY TASKS 8-3. Table 8-1 discusses the primary tasks and purposes of preventive dentistry. Table 8-1. Primary tasks and purposes of preventive dentistry Primary task Purpose Conduct periodic examination of Soldiers’ teeth, gums, and jaw Identify dental deficiencies and recommend follow-up courses of action. Classify Soldiers’ dental conditions in the dental classification system and determine Soldiers’ dental readiness status Determine Soldiers dental classification and dental readiness status. Provide training to Soldiers and units on measures to take to mitigate the adverse impact of dental threats Provide training/education to Soldiers and unit leaders on identifying dental threats, taking preventive measures to mitigate or eliminate the dental threat, and ensuring Soldiers are practicing good oral hygiene. SECTION II — DENTAL SERVICES TREATMENT ASPECTS 8-4. The mission of the dental service support system is to promote dental health; prevent and treat oral and dental disease; provide far forward dental treatment; provide early treatment of severe oral and maxillofacial injuries; and augment medical personnel (as necessary) during mass casualty operations. Chapter 8 8-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 LEVELS OF DENTAL SUPPORT 8-5. There are three levels of dental support, previously known as levels of dental care, within the AO. These levels are defined primarily by the relationship of the dental assets supporting the patient population within each level. These levels of dental support are exclusive and not synonymous with the medical roles of care. Reference paragraphs 1-32 through 1-47 for more discussion on the medical roles of care. LEVEL 1 DENTAL SUPPORT 8-6. The first dental care a Soldier receives is provided by Level 1 dental support (previously known as unit-level dental care). This level of support consists of those services provided by dental personnel organic to the supporting medical companies and special forces groups (SFGs). 8-7. This level of support provides operational dental care to Soldiers during a range of military operations from dental assets in a direct support relationship to an area support task. Major emphasis is placed on those measures necessary for the patient to return to duty or to stabilize them and allow for their evacuation to the next role of medical care. LEVEL 2 DENTAL SUPPORT 8-8. Level 2 dental support (previously known as hospital-level dental care) consists of those services provided by the hospital dental staff to minimize loss of life and disability resulting from oral and maxillofacial injuries and wounds. The hospital dental staff provides operational dental care and preventive dental care to all injured or wounded Soldiers, as well as the hospital staff. The hospital dental staff will not normally provide Level 1 dental support to organizations outside of the hospital, however they will direct patients to the Level 3 dental support activity. 8-9. Emphasis is placed on those measures necessary for the patient to return to duty or to stabilize them and allow for their evacuation to the next role of medical care. If needed the hospital dental staff can coordinate with the dental company (area support) (DCAS) for patient consultation and treatment. LEVEL 3 DENTAL SUPPORT 8-10. Level 3 dental support (previously known as area dental support) is provided for units that do not have organic dental assets or those patients being referred by the Level 2 dental support. This level of support is provided by the DCAS. 8-11. The DCAS provides operational dental care and has dental assets which can deploy, when and where necessary, to provide augmentation and/or reinforcement to the area support squads. CATEGORIES OF DENTAL CARE 8-12. Dental service planning must include the consideration of two categories of dental services in joint and multinational operations. Operational dental care is provided within the area of operations (AO), and comprehensive dental care is provided in the support base, normally found only in fixed facilities, out of theater such as in the joint security area or the strategic support area. These categories are not absolute in their limits; they are the general basis for defining the dental service capabilities available at the different AHS roles of care. OPERATIONAL DENTAL CARE 8-13. Operational dental care is the dental care provided for deployed Soldiers in theater consisting of emergency dental care and essential dental care (ATP 4-02.19). Emergency Care 8-14.Emergency dental care is the care given for the relief of oral pain; diagnosis and treatment of infections; control of life-threatening oral conditions (hemorrhage, cellulitis, or respiratory difficulties); and treatment of trauma to teeth, jaws (maxilla/mandible), and associated facial structures is considered emergency care Dental Services 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 8-3 (ATP 4-02.19). It is the most austere form of dental care provided to deployed Soldiers who are engaged in tactical operations. 8-15. Common examples of emergency dental treatments include:  Airway management.  Hemorrhage control.  Stabilization of maxillofacial injuries (fracture stabilization, soft tissue injury/lacerations repair).  Simple extractions.  Management of maxillofacial infection (antibiotics, incision, and drainage).  Interim pulp therapy (pulpectomy).  Pain medication.  Temporary restorations. Essential Dental Care 8-16. Essential dental care is the dental care necessary to intercept potential emergencies to prevent lost duty time and preserve fighting strength (ATP 4-02.19). Essential dental care is the highest category of operational dental care available in theater. It enhances the individual Soldier’s combat readiness and can prevent lost duty time. It is for these reasons that essential dental care is made readily available. Soldiers who are categorized as Class 2 (untreated oral disease) or Class 3 (potential dental emergencies) should receive essential care as soon as the tactical situation and availability of dental assets permit. 8-17. Essential treatments performed by dental officers may include:  Basic restorations.  Extractions.  Definitive pulp therapy (pulpectomy, obturation).  Treatment of periodontal conditions.  Simple prosthetic repairs. Comprehensive Dental Care 8-18. Comprehensive dental care is the dental treatment to restore and/or maintain a Soldier’s optimal oral health, function, and aesthetics (ATP 4-02.19). 8-19. This category of care is usually reserved for medical support plans that anticipate an extended period of reception and training in theater and is also included as a component of the theater hospitalization capability. The scope of facilities needed to provide this level of dental support should equal that of theater hospitalization medical treatment facility (MTF) capability. PRIMARY TASKS 8-20. Table 8-2 discusses the primary tasks and purposes of the dental services function. Table 8-2. Primary tasks and purposes of the dental services function Primary task Purpose Provide comprehensive dental care Restore an individual to optimal oral health, function, and aesthetics. Normally provided in continental United States-support base. Provide operational dental care Provide treatment in austere environments for Soldiers engaged in operations. Operational care is provided in the area of operations and consists of emergency dental care and essential dental care. Chapter 8 8-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Table 8-2. Primary tasks and purposes of the dental services function (continued) Primary task Purpose Conduct emergency dental care Relieve oral pain, eliminate acute infection, control life-threatening oral conditions (hemorrhage, cellulitis, or respiratory difficulty) and treat trauma to teeth, jaws, and associated facial structures. Conduct essential dental care Prevent potential dental emergencies and maintain the overall oral fitness of Soldiers at levels consistent with combat readiness. Perform oral maxillofacial surgery Provide oral maxillofacial surgery capability to minimize loss of life and disability resulting from oral and maxillofacial injuries and wounds within the area of operations. 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 9-1 Chapter 9 Laboratory Services This chapter discusses environmental and clinical medical laboratory services. SECTION I — AREA MEDICAL LABORATORY SUPPORT 9-1. The AML includes capabilities in the identification and theater validation of suspect CBRN agents, endemic diseases, and OEH hazards. Its focus is the total health environment of the operational area, not individual patient care. 9-2. The AML is the Army’s specialized theater laboratory that deploys worldwide as a unit or by task- organized teams to perform surveillance, analytical laboratory testing and health hazard assessments of environmental, occupational, endemic, and CBRN threats in support of Soldier protection and weapons of mass destruction missions. FIELD ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY 9-3. The AML tests air, water, soil, food, waste, and vectors (insects, animals) for a broad range of microbiological, radiological, and/or chemical contaminants under two basic scenarios:  As a field environmental laboratory (theater validation) in support of theater operations. The AML provides—  Theater validation level of identification to enable commanders and health care providers to make data-based decisions.  Support to multiple medical detachments (preventive medicine and veterinary services) with surveillance/surveillance oversight, sample collection/sample management, and rapid laboratory analysis and validation.  In contingency operations (for example, after use of weapons of mass destruction), the AML provides—  Immediate hazard identification (presumptive or field confirmatory level of identification) in high risk environments with chemical or biological agent contamination, epidemic disease, or industrial contamination.  Rapid laboratory analysis and theater validation level of identification to assist commanders in making operational decisions. 9-4. The AML is organized into teams consisting of the following:  The staff (headquarters) section provides command, control, and communications support for the unit and accomplishes all required administrative functions of the unit.  The analytical chemistry (CBRN) section conducts analytical chemistry support by providing identification of chemical agents in the environment to include food, water, plants, soil, and explosives.  The microbiology (endemic) section conducts biological agent analysis using multiple methodologies, provides identification of endemic disease agents, and supports animal pathology and endemic disease surveillance.  The OEH surveillance (CBRN) section provides identification for environmental samples and clinical specimens using multiple methodologies. This section also provides diagnostic capability to identify outbreaks of regionally specific endemic diseases and serves as a resource of information for higher-level command medical personnel. This section also provides the Chapter 9 9-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 operational commander the immediate hazard identification (presumptive or field confirmatory level of identification) of CBRN. 9-5. For more information on the AML, refer to ATP 4-02.7/MCRP 4-11.1F/NTTP 4-02.7/AFTTP 3-42.3. Figure 9-1 depicts the four levels of identification where AML serves as a theater validation environmental laboratory. Figure 9-1. Four levels of identification PRIMARY TASKS 9-6. Table 9-1 discusses the primary tasks and purposes of the operational medical laboratory function performed by the AML. Table 9-1. Primary tasks and purposes of the operational medical laboratory function performed by the area medical laboratory Primary task Purpose Provide analytical, investigational, and consultative capabilities Identify chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat agents in biomedical specimens and other samples from the area of operations. Assist in the identification of OEH hazards and endemic diseases. Provide special environmental control and containment Evaluate biomedical specimens for the presence of highly infectious or hazardous agents of operational concern. Provide data and data analysis Support medical analyses and operational decisions. Conduct medical laboratory analysis Support the diagnosis of zoonotic and significant animal diseases that impact on military operations. Deploy modular sections or sectional teams Interface with preventive medicine teams, veterinary teams, forward- deployed Army Health System units, biological integrated detection system teams, and chemical company elements operating in the area of operations. Laboratory Services 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 9-3 SECTION II — CLINICAL LABORATORY SERVICES 9-7. All Role 2 MTFs provide basic clinical laboratory services within the AO. They perform basic procedures in hematology, urinalysis, microbiology, and serology. Role 2 MTFs receive, maintain, and transfuse blood products. 9-8. The clinical laboratory in the CSH/hospital center performs procedures in biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis, microbiology, and serology in support of clinical activities. The CSH/hospital center also provides blood-banking services. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR CLINICAL LABORATORY SUPPORT 9-9. At Role 2, medical laboratory support may be very limited. Diagnostic testing for evidence of CBRN exposure or disease may be difficult unless technologies are present to ensure high levels of safety (for example, biological safety cabinets). Laboratory personnel prepare collected suspect CBRN specimens for submission to supporting medical laboratories while maintaining chain-of-custody. 9-10. At Role 3, medical laboratory support in a CSH or hospital center is intended for providing clinical laboratory support and is primarily in support of acute surgical cases, blood services, and immediate services required for intensive care operations. Microbiology services may also be available to include bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing. A polymerase chain reaction technology has been fielded to most Role 3 MTF laboratories for initial field confirmation analysis of biological warfare agents. Patients with documented or suspected exposure to CBRN weapons/agents will be medically evaluated; specimens will be collected, packaged, and a chain-of-custody will be established and forwarded through technical channels to a supporting medical laboratory for further analysis. For more information, refer to ATP 4- 02.7/MCRP 4-11.1F/NTTP 4-02.7/AFTTP 3-42.3. PRIMARY TASKS 9-11. Table 9-2 discusses the primary tasks and purposes of the clinical laboratory services function. Table 9-2. Primary tasks and purposes of the clinical laboratory services Primary task Purpose Provide analysis of medical specimens Provide for the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and pathogens. Provide blood-banking services to include capability to type and crossmatch blood samples and perform limited testing of whole blood. Provide blood banking services Provide laboratory support to type and crossmatch blood specimens for transfusion services. Provide limited testing of blood products. This page intentionally left blank. 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 10-1 PART THREE Health Service Support Health service support pertains to the treatment and MEDEVAC of patients from the battlefield and the required Class VIII supplies, equipment, and services to necessary to sustain these operations. Health service support encompasses three components: direct patient care, MEDEVAC, and MEDLOG. This part of the publication discusses— ● Direct patient care aspects of the AHS mission. It includes medical treatment (organic and area support) and hospitalization. Health Service Support includes the treatment of CBRN patients. ● Medical evacuation to include medical regulating, and the provision of en route care to patients being transported. ● Medical logistics inclusive of all functional subcomponents and services to include blood management. Chapter 10 Direct Patient Care The mission set of direct patient care comprises of the medical functions of medical treatment (organic and area support) and hospitalization. Health service support includes the treatment of CBRN casualties. Although these medical functions are aligned with specific tasks, the execution of the individual functions are interrelated, interconnected, and independent and require close coordination and integration to facilitate effective and efficient provision of AHS support. SECTION I — MEDICAL TREATMENT (ORGANIC AND AREA SUPPORT) 10-1. The medical treatment function encompasses Roles 1 and 2 medical treatment support. These roles of care are provided by organic assets (medical platoons of maneuver forces and treatment teams assigned to sustainment units) or on an area support basis from supporting medical companies or detachments. Within the BCTs and EAB AHS units, this support is provided by the medical company (brigade support) and the medical company (area support). The area support function encompasses TCCC, routine sick call, emergency dental care, operational public health, and COSC support. Chapter 10 10-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 MEDICAL COMPANY 10-2. At Role 2 MTFs, in addition to the Role 1 capabilities, these additional services are available- x-ray, medical laboratory, essential dental care, and patient holding capability. Medical companies may also be augmented with physical therapy services and optometry services and collocated with an FST or FRSD. 10-3. During operations, each medical company is assigned a specific AO to ensure all personnel receive adequate medical care. Within each company AO, the treatment platoon with its medical treatment squads, area support treatment squad (dental, x-ray, laboratory, and patient-holding capability) forms the core of the company’s support scheme. The medical treatment squads are employed geographically to best support the troop population. Company ambulances are collocated with medical elements to provide a ground MEDEVAC capability or to evacuate patients to the Role 2 MTF established by the area support section of the medical company for further treatment or holding. PRIMARY TASKS 10-4. Table 10-1 discusses the primary tasks and purposes of the medical treatment (organic and area support) function. Table 10-1. Primary tasks and purposes of the medical treatment (organic and area support) function Primary task Purpose Provide first aid Decrease killed-in-action rate. This task is performed by nonmedical Soldiers performing self-aid, buddy aid, and/or combat lifesaver support prior to arrival of the combat medic and/or other health care personnel. Provide tactical combat casualty care Provide lifesaving intervention at the point of injury or wounding. This task is performed by the combat medic who locates, acquires, stabilizes, and evacuates patients with combat trauma. At echelons above brigade, this task is referred to as emergency medical treatment in noncombat operations. Provide forward resuscitative surgery Provide a damage control surgery capability close to the point of injury or wounding. This care is provided by a forward surgical team collocated with a Role 2 medical treatment facility. Conduct routine sick call Provide primary care services as close to patient’s unit as possible. Provide patient holding Provide a short-term holding capability (not to exceed 72 hours) for patients requiring minimal care prior to returning to duty. Promote casualty prevention measures Promote wellness and enhance Soldier medical readiness to decrease morbidity and mortality. There are no operational public health or combat and operational stress control assets at Role 1; however, they are available at Role 2. Provide medical evacuation Provide medical evacuation by ground ambulance on an area support basis and to provide en route medical treatment during transport. Provide physical therapy Role 2 medical treatment facilities may be augmented with a physical therapy team to provide assistance in strengthening the Soldier’s physical resiliency, assistance in the prevention of neuromusculoskeletal injuries, and treatment of Soldiers with neuromusculoskeletal injuries allowing them to return to duty as soon as possible. SECTION II — THEATER HOSPITALIZATION 10-5. Theater hospitalization provides essential care within the theater evacuation policy to either return a patient to duty or stabilize a patient for evacuation to a definitive care facility outside the AO. A hospital is a medical treatment facility capable of providing inpatient care. It is appropriately staffed and equipped to provide diagnostic and therapeutic services, as well as the necessary supporting services required to perform its assigned mission and functions. In addition, a hospital may discharge the functions of a clinic. Often, the terms hospital and MTF are misused interchangeably. While a Role 3 MTF provides hospitalization, and is therefore a hospital, Role 1 and 2 MTFs do not provide all of the capabilities included in hospitalization. Direct Patient Care 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 10-3 Thus, Role 1 and 2 MTFs are not hospitals. The Army Medicine provides Role 3 medical capabilities with two organizations, the currently fielded CSH and the recently designed and Army approved hospital center.Both hospital's assigned medical personnel, facilities, equipment, and materials provide the requisite capabilities to render significant preventive and curative health care. These highly robust services encompass primary inpatient and outpatient care; emergent care; and enhanced medical, surgical, and ancillary capabilities. Inpatient refers to a person admitted to and treated within a Role 3 and 4 hospital and who cannot be returned to duty within the same calendar day (ATP 4-02.10). While outpatient is a person receiving medical/dental examination and/or treatment from medical personnel and in a status other than being admitted to a hospital. Included in this category is the person who is treated and retained (held) in a medical treatment facility (such as a Role 2 facility) other than a hospital (ATP 4-02.10). The modular design of the hospital provides the capability to tailor and deploy capabilities as modules or multiple individual capabilities that provide incrementally increased medical services. The theater hospitals may be augmented by one or more medical detachments, hospital augmentation teams, or medical teams designed to enhance the hospital's capabilities to provide HSS to the AO. 10-6. Theater hospital capabilities include triage/emergency care, outpatient services, inpatient care, pharmacy, clinical laboratory, blood banking, radiology, physical therapy, MEDLOG, operational dental care (emergency and essential dental care), oral and maxillofacial surgery, nutrition care, and patient administration services. Triage is the process of sorting casualties based on need for treatment, evacuation, and available resources. Triage consists of the immediate sorting of patients according to type and seriousness of injury, and likelihood of survival, and the establishment of priority for treatment and evacuation to assure medical care of the greatest benefit to the largest number. The categories of triage are: MINIMAL (OR AMBULATORY) - those who require limited treatment and can be rapidly returned to duty; IMMEDIATE- patients requiring immediate care to save life, limb or eyesight; DELAYED- patients who, after emergency treatment, incur little additional risk by delaying further treatment; and EXPECTANT- patients so critically injured that only complicated and prolonged treatment will improve the chances of survival. PRIMARY TASKS 10-7. Table 10-2 on page 10-4 discusses the primary tasks and purposes of theater hospitalization function. COMBAT SUPPORT HOSPITALS 10-8. The CSH provides hospitalization and outpatient care for all classes of patients within the AO. It is comprised of a headquarters and headquarters detachment and two hospital companies (one 84-bed and one 164-bed company) 10-9. The CSH provides hospitalization for up to 248 patients and treatment for all classes of patients. 10-10. Surgical capacity is based on six operating room tables staffed for 96 operating table hours per day. The six operating room tables are contained in three operating room shelters. Surgical capabilities include general, orthopedic, thoracic, urological, gynecological, and oral maxillofacial. 10-11. Other capabilities include:  Medical command and control of organic and attached elements include AHS planning, policies, and support operations with the hospital AO.  Emergency treatment to receive, triage, and resuscitate casualties to include civilians and enemy prisoners of war, as required.  Consultation services for inpatient and outpatient support.  Pastoral care for staff and patients, as well as ethical advisement on bioethics or end of life issues.  Pharmacy, psychiatry, public health nursing, clinical laboratory, blood banking, radiology, physical therapy, and nutrition care services.  Medical administrative and logistical services.  Operational dental care treatment.  Medical logistics support to the FST/FRST, when attached. Chapter 10 10-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020  Reconstitution of the FST/FRST as directed by higher headquarters or the operation plan. 10-12. For maximum use of the CSH, the entire organization should deploy together, however, due to its limited mobility and the availability of transportation support, it may be necessary to deploy by modules/echelons. Table 10-2.

Provide consultation support ­ Provide specialty medical consultation to Role 1 and 2 medical providers to enhance the care given in forward areas, potentially eliminating the need to evacuate some patients rearward. HOSPITAL CENTER 10-13. The hospital center is a modular MTF designed to provide Role 3 medical capability in a tailored organizational structure to support the Army’s varied unified operations missions. The organization was designed to support the Army’s requirement to conduct a mix of offensive, defensive and stability and support of civil authorities’ tasks simultaneously in a variety of scenarios. Depending on the mission, supported population, patient at risks, surgical and medical care providing a surgical and medical organizations. The hospital center provides essential care within the theater evacuation policy to either return the patient to duty and/or stabilize the patient for evacuation to a definitive care facility outside the AO. The hospital’s assigned medical personnel, facilities, equipment, and materials provide the requisite capabilities to render significant preventive and curative health care. These highly robust services encompass primary inpatient and outpatient care; emergent care; and enhanced medical, surgical, and ancillary capabilities. The modular design of the hospital provides the capability to tailor and deploy capabilities as modules or multiple individual capabilities that provide incrementally increased medical services. The field hospital (32 bed) may be augmented by one or more medical detachments, hospital augmentation teams, or medical teams designed to enhance the hospital’s capabilities to provide HSS to the AO. 10-14. The enhanced organizational design replaces the current CSH providing a more agile, deployable, versatile and medically capable hospital. 10-15. The headquarters and headquarters detachment (HHD), hospital center and field hospital (32 bed) are the core and lowest denominator of the hospital organization. The field hospital (32 bed) represents the smallest unit that can provide the complete clinical capabilities of a Role 3 MTF. This hospital is deliberately designed to be self-supporting while remaining light, highly mobile, and expandable. The HHD, hospital center and field hospital (32 bed) are designed as the first increment to be deployed in support of an expeditionary force. The HHD, hospital center and field hospital (32 bed) can be expanded incrementally to a maximum 240 bed hospitalization capability. The HHD hospital center can command one to two field hospitals (32 bed) in separate locations without augmentation. Combinations of the modular units within the hospitalization capability would be suitable to support across the competition continuum and fully integrating operations with joint, interagency, and multinational partners. 10-16. Increases in overall clinical functions of the hospitalization capability include:  Computed Tomography services.  Microbiology laboratory services.  Critical care physicians, (intensivists), to manage patients in the intensive care unit.  Internal medicine physicians, (hospitalists), to manage patients in the intermediate care ward.  Emergency room physician assistants in the triage/pre-operative care and emergency medical treatment section.  Psychiatry and inpatient neuropsychiatric consultation services.  Minimal psychiatry inpatient capabilities.  Increased capacity of intensive care beds.  Improvements in versatility and agility.  Command and communications capability to conduct split base operations indefinitely without augmentation. Chapter 10 10-6 FM 4-02 17 November 2020  Augmentation detachments with specific clinical specialties can be adapted to better support the mission.  The hospitalization capability can be built up or scaled down based on the tactical situation. 10-17. Deployability and adaptability:  The initial hospital capability is a 100 percent mobile field hospital (32 bed) and is dependent on the HHD, hospital center for transportation support.  Each element and hospital augmentation detachment has a separate TOE.  Each hospital augmentation detachment is designed to expand the capabilities and increase the capacities of the field hospital (32 bed).  Commanders can tailor the medical forces to support unified land operations, matching the anticipated mix of capabilities and medical specialties to the population supported and the clinical challenges they present. HOSPITAL CENTER COMPONENTS AND EMPLOYMENT 10-18. This section will be discussing hospital center employment. HEADQUARTERS AND HEADQUARTERS DETACHMENT, HOSPITAL CENTER 10-19. The HHD, hospital center provides command and control, consultation services, for up to two functioning, dual-based, field hospitals (32 bed) and requisite augmentation detachments, with a combined maximum of 240 beds. Medical command and control for hospitalization in more than one location presents unique HSS support planning requirements. The distance between hospital elements as well as requisite surgical and bed requirements for each location have a significant impact on the planning and employment process. Medical planners may want to consider employing two HHD, hospital centers if the operations do not allow adequate command and control, senior medical consultation, and adequate transportation to transport the hospital center during deployment or moves. 10-20. The HHD, hospital center is dependent on the field hospital (32 bed) for administrative support, feeding, unit level maintenance, security, power and classes of supply. FIELD HOSPITAL (32 BED) 10-21. The field hospital (32 bed) is the corner stone of the deployed hospital. It represents the smallest hospital element with complete requisite clinical capabilities of a Role 3 MTF. This hospital is deliberately designed to be self-supporting while remaining light, highly mobile, and expandable. Combinations of the modular units within the hospitalization capability would be suitable to support peacetime military engagements, limited intervention, peace operations and irregular warfare. 10-22. Capable of providing complete Role 3 hospitalization under the command and control of the HHD, hospital center with a 72-hour basic load of medical and nonmedical supplies. Hospitalization for up to 32 patients consisting of one ward providing intensive care nursing for up to twelve patients (ten beds are fully equipped for patients requiring the most intensive monitoring/care) and one ward providing intermediate care nursing for up to twenty patients. Provides emergency treatment to receive, triage, and prepare incoming patients for surgery. Surgical capability consisting of general, orthopedic, obstetrical/gynecological surgery based on two operating tables staffed for 36 operating table hours per day. Provides pharmacy and clinical laboratory services to include: limited basic microbiology screening, blood banking, computed tomography and radiology services. The field hospital (32 bed) provides personnel administration, patient administration, logistical, nutrition care services, and a hospital ministry team for hospital staff and patients. 10-23. The field hospital (32 bed), as an individual unit, was not designed to perform split based operations for a sustained period of time. If the capabilities of the field hospital (32 bed) are required in a two locations then two field hospitals and requisite hospital augmentation detachments will be required to support the medical plan. Direct Patient Care 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 10-7 HOSPITAL AUGMENTATION DETACHMENTS 10-24. Hospital augmentation detachments that may be attached to the field hospital (32 bed) to increase its bed, surgical and staffing and medical specialty capabilities. The hospital augmentation detachments consists of a surgical (24 bed) detachment, medical (32 bed) detachment, and an intermediate care ward (60 bed) detachment. 10-25. The hospital augmentation detachment (surgical 24 bed) augments the field hospital (32 bed) with thoracic, urology, oral maxillofacial surgical capabilities, 24 additional intensive care beds, outpatient service and microbiology. 10-26. The hospital augmentation detachment (medical 32 bed) augments the field hospital (32 bed) with operational dental care, one additional intensive care unit, one intermediate care ward, additional microbiology capabilities and outpatient services for all classes of patients within the Theater. 10-27. The hospital augmentation detachment (intermediate care ward 60 bed) augments the capabilities of the hospital center as required with three additional intermediate care wards providing intermediate nursing care and additional personnel to support nutrition and patient administration capabilities. HOSPITAL CENTER CONFIGURATIONS 10-28. The hospital center has the capability of being deployed in multiple configurations to provide requisite care to any military or humanitarian operation. The hospital center has the capability of to perform split-based operations within an AO. Split-based operation limitations include the 240 maximum number of beds per hospital center and command and control limitations. The HHD, hospital center has the capability to provide medical command and control and support for up to a 240 bed hospital center when employed in one or two locations.Table 10-3 (on page 10-8) depicts the bed types and numbers as well as surgical capabilities available to per hospital center modules. 10-29. The initial entry piece of the hospital will be the HHD, Hospital Center collocated with one field hospital (32 Bed). With the addition of a second field hospital (32 Bed) and/or the surgical, medical or intermediate care ward augmentation detachments as many as 240 beds can be deployed in one or two locations to support a LSCL. 10-30. The field hospital (32 bed) and augmentation detachments are dependent on transportation support from the HHD, hospital center and may require additional transportation support based on employment criteria.

SECTION I — INTEGRATED MEDICAL EVACUATION SYSTEM 11-1. Medical evacuation is the system which provides the vital linkage between the roles of care necessary to sustain the patient during transport. This is accomplished by providing en route medical care and emergency medical intervention, if required, which enhances the individual’s prognosis and reduces long- term disability. 11-2. Army MEDEVAC is a multifaceted mission accomplished by a combination of dedicated ground and air evacuation platforms synchronized to provide direct support, general support, and area support within the AO. At the operational level, organic or direct support MEDEVAC resources locate, acquire, treat, and evacuate Soldiers from the POI or wounding to an appropriate MTF. Soldiers are then stabilized, prioritized, and prepared for further evacuation, if required, to an MTF capable of providing required essential care within the AO. Essential care refers to the absolutely necessary initial, en route, resuscitative, and surgical care provided to save, stabilize, and return as many Soldiers to duty as quickly as possible. Essential care is medical care provided by medical providers at all roles of care that focuses on saving life, limb, and eyesight, and returning as many Soldiers to duty as quickly as possible within the theater evacuation policy or begin initial treatment required for optimization of outcome and/or stabilization to ensure the patient can endure evacuation. 11-3. The mission of Army MEDEVAC assets is the evacuation and provision of en route medical care, however, the essential and vital functions of MEDEVAC resources encompass many additional missions and tasks that support the AHS. Medical evacuation resources/assets are used to transfer patients between MTFs within the AO and from MTFs to USAF en route patient staging system; emergency movement of Class VIII, blood and blood products, medical personnel and equipment; and serve as messengers in medical channels. 11-4. The appropriate roles of medical care must be maintained throughout the continuum of care. A patient who has received complex care such as damage control resuscitation or damage control surgery requires continuous maintenance of the critical care support that was initiated at the forward MTF. To avoid the risk that these patients will deteriorate during transport, the level of care should not be decremented during en route care. Based on the appropriate level of care, the medical personnel providing en route care may be paramedics, nurses, or other properly trained medical specialists. When possible, this en route care should be used as far forward as mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations allows. THEATER EVACUATION POLICY 11-5. The theater evacuation policy is established by the Secretary of Defense, with the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and upon the recommendation of the CCDR. Theater evacuation policy is a command decision indicating the length in days of the maximum period of non-effectiveness that patients may be held within the command for treatment, and the medical determination of patients that cannot return to duty status within the period prescribed requiring evacuation by the first available means, provided the travel involved will not aggravate their disabilities or medical condition. (ATP 4-02.2). Chapter 11 11-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 11-6. The medical commander may recommend changes in the theater evacuation policy to adjust patient flow within the deployed setting to include skip policy and surge capacity when necessary. The policy establishes, in number of days, the maximum period of noneffectiveness (hospitalization and convalescence) that patients may be held within the theater for treatment. This policy does not mean that a patient is held in the theater for the entire period of noneffectiveness. A patient who is not expected to be ready to return to duty within the number of days established by the theater evacuation policy is treated, stabilized, and then evacuated out of the theater. This is done providing that the treating physician determines that such evacuation will not aggravate the patient’s disabilities or medical condition. For example, a theater evacuation policy of seven days does not mean that a patient is held in the theater for seven days and then evacuated. Instead, it means that a patient is evacuated as soon as possible after the determination is made that he cannot be returned to duty within seven days following admission to a Role 3 MTF. EVACUATION PRECEDENCE 11-7. The initial decision for evacuation priorities is made by the treatment element or the senior nonmedical person at the scene. Soldiers are evacuated by the most expeditious means of MEDEVAC based on their medical condition, assigned evacuation precedence, and availability of MEDEVAC platforms. Patients are evacuated from the POI or wounding to the appropriate MTF. The evacuation precedence for the Army operations at Roles 1 through 3 are:  Priority I, URGENT is assigned to emergency cases that should be evacuated as soon as possible and within a maximum of one hour to save life, limb, or eyesight and to prevent complications of serious illness and to avoid permanent disability.  Priority IA, URGENT-SURG is assigned to patients that should be evacuated as soon as possible and within a maximum of one hour who must receive far forward surgical intervention to save life, limb, or eyesight and stabilize for further evacuation.  Priority II, PRIORITY is assigned to sick and wounded personnel requiring prompt medical care. This precedence is used when the individual should be evacuated within four hours or if the personnel’s medical condition could deteriorate to such a degree that this person will become an URGENT precedence, or whose requirements for special treatment are not available locally, or who will suffer unnecessary pain or disability.  Priority III, ROUTINE is assigned to sick and wounded personnel requiring evacuation but whose condition is not expected to deteriorate significantly. The sick and wounded in this category should be evacuated within 24 hours.  Priority IV, CONVENIENCE is assigned to patients for whom evacuation by medical vehicle is a matter of medical convenience rather than necessity. Note 1. The NATO STANAG 3204 has deleted the category of Priority IV, CONVENIENCE. However, this category is still included in the U.S. Army evacuation priorities as there is a requirement for it in an OE. Note 2. The Army has implemented the AE standard of a one-hour mission completion time for urgent and urgent surgical missions (time from mission request to delivery of the patient to the appropriate medical care). If appropriate medical care for urgent and urgent surgical missions can be reached within the one-hour standard by other transportation conveyances, the one-hour evacuation standard is met. RESPONSIBILITIES 11-8. The Service component commander is responsible for evacuation at the operational level and is responsible for executing the evacuation of casualties. The Army is the only Service with dedicated MEDEVAC assets and is specifically tasked by DOD to provide intratheater AE. Strategic AE is the responsibility of the U.S. Transportation Command. Medical Evacuation 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 11-3 11-9. Within Army support to other Services, Army resources may provide ship-to-shore MEDEVAC on an area support basis. Medical evacuation from shore-to-ship for deployed USN and United States Marine Corps, as well as direct and general support to United States Marine Corps forces (when tactically operating on land as a maneuver force) forces could also be available within the Army’s support capabilities. ORGANIZATIONS 11-10. There are two types of United States Army MEDEVAC platforms- air (rotary-wing) and ground. These platforms are dedicated and designed, equipped, and staffed to perform the MEDEVAC mission. MANEUVER BATTALION MEDICAL PLATOON 11-11. The organic medical platoon ground ambulances provide MEDEVAC support from the POI, company aid post, or casualty collection point to the battalion aid station. A casualty collection point is a location that may or may not be staffed, where casualties are assembled for evacuation to a medical treatment facility. (ATP 4-02.2). It is usually predesignated. In armored BCTs depending upon the mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations factors and the MEDEVAC plan, the tracked ambulances may evacuate the patient to an ambulance exchange point and transfer the patient to a wheeled ambulance for further movement to an MTF. This enables the tracked ambulance to keep pace with the maneuvering force. GROUND AMBULANCES 11-12. Ground ambulances are organic to BCT maneuver battalion medical platoons and to both the medical company (brigade support) and the medical company (area support). In the maneuver battalion medical platoons, the actual vehicle platform (wheeled or tracked) varies with the type of parent unit. Both the brigade support medical company and the medical company (area support) have wheeled vehicles. Brigade Support and/or Area Support Medical Company Evacuation Platoon 11-13. The medical company (brigade support) evacuation platoon provides MEDEVAC support on an area basis to units within its assigned AO. Additionally, it provides direct support to evacuate patients from the supported battalion aid stations to the medical company Role 2 MTF. 11-14. The medical company (area support) provides supported EAB units with MEDEVAC support on an area basis for those units that do not have organic MEDEVAC resources. Medical Company (Ground Ambulance) 11-15. The mission of the medical company (ground ambulance) is to provide ground evacuation within the theater. This unit provides direct support to BCTs and is employed in the EAB to provide area support. It is tactically located where it can best control its assets and execute its patient evacuation mission. This unit has a single-lift capability for evacuation of 96 litter patients or 192 ambulatory patients. AIR AMBULANCES 11-16. The medical company (air ambulance) provides MEDEVAC for all categories of patients with evacuation precedence and other considerations within the AO on an area and direct support basis. The single lift evacuation capacity varies among the three different air ambulance companies. See ATP 4-02.2 Medical Evacuation, for more information. Chapter 11 11-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 PRIMARY TASKS 11-17. Table 11-1 discusses the primary tasks and purposes of the MEDEVAC function. Table 11-1. Primary tasks and purposes of the medical evacuation function Primary task Purpose Acquire and locate Provide a rapid response to acquire wounded, injured, and ill personnel.Clear the battlefield of casualties and facilitate and enhance the tactical commander’s freedom of movement and maneuver.

This task is performed by the evacuation platforms in the medical company (ground ambulance) and medical company (air ambulance). Provide emergency movement of medical personnel, equipment, and supplies Provide a rapid response for the emergency movement of scarce medical resources throughout an operational environment. 11-18. For additional information on MEDEVAC and medical regulating, refer to JP 4-02, AR 40-3 and ATP 4-02.2. SECTION II — MEDICAL REGULATING 11-19. Medical regulating refers to the actions and coordination necessary to arrange for the movement of patients through the roles of care and to match patients with a medical treatment facility that has the necessary health service support capabilities and available bed space. (JP 4-02). This system is designed to ensure the efficient and safe movement of patients. 11-20. Medical regulating entails identifying the patients awaiting evacuation, locating the available beds, and coordinating the transportation means for movement. Careful control of patient evacuation to appropriate hospitals is necessary to—  Effect an even distribution of cases.  Ensure adequate beds are available for current and anticipated needs.  Route patients requiring specialized treatment to the appropriate MTF. 11-21. The factors that influence the scheduling of patient movement include:  Patient’s medical condition (stabilized to withstand evacuation).  Operational situation.  Availability of evacuation means.  Locations of MTFs with special capabilities or resources.  Current bed status of MTFs.  Surgical backlogs.  Number and location of patients by diagnostic category.  Location of airfields, seaports, and other transportation hubs.  Communications capabilities (to include radio silence procedures). 11-22. For more information on medical regulating, refer to ATP 4-02.2. Medical Evacuation 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 11-5 SECTION III — STRATEGIC MEDICAL EVACUATION AND PATIENT MOVEMENT 11-23. Medical evacuation occurs at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels and requires the synchronization and integration of Service component MEDEVAC resources and procedures with the DOD worldwide evacuation system operated by the U.S. Transportation Command. 11-24. A comprehensive MEDEVAC plan is essential to ensure effective, efficient, and responsive MEDEVAC is provided to all wounded, injured, and ill Soldiers in the AO. The Army MEDEVAC plan flows from the CCDRs guidance and intent and incorporates all missions and tasks directed by the CCDR to be accomplished and is synchronized with supporting and supported units. In some scenarios, Army air and ground evacuation resources may be directed to provide support to sister Services, multinational partners, and host-nation forces. 11-25. When directed by the CCDR, Army MEDEVAC assets may be tasked to support other than Army forces engaged in the execution of the joint mission. These additional support missions will be clearly articulated in the CCDRs OPLAN and OPORD. The theater army surgeon, with the advice of the senior MEDEVAC planner, will coordinate and synchronize these support operations with the combatant command surgeon, joint task force surgeon, and the other Services and/or multinational partners as required ensuring that a comprehensive and effective, efficient, and responsive plan is developed and implemented.

Also key to this success is the delivery of a MEDLOG capability that anticipates the needs of the customer and is tailored to continuously provide end-to-end sustainment of the AHS mission throughout the competition continuum. Providing timely and effective AHS support is a team effort which integrates the clinical and operational aspects of the mission. This chapter provides an overview of the medical logistics function. Refer to ATP 4-02.1 for a more detailed description of the Army MEDLOG system. SECTION I — MEDICAL LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT IN AN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT 12-1. The MEDLOG system encompasses planning and executing all Class VIII supply support operations to include management of the following functions:  medical materiel (Class VIIIA), medical equipment maintenance and repair, patient movement items, medical gases, blood (Class VIIIB) storage and distribution, regulated medical waste (including hazardous material), health facilities planning and management, and medical contracting. SECTION II — MEDICAL LOGISTICS SYSTEM 12-2. The theater MEDLOG system consists of the following organizations:  Medical logistics management center.  Medical Logistics Company.  Medical detachment (blood support).  Medical team (optometry).  Medical command and control headquarters (to include the MEDCOM [DS], MEDBDE [SPT], and MMB). MEDICAL LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT CENTER 12-3. The MEDLOG management center provides theater-level centralized management of critical Class VIII commodities, patient movement items, medical contracting support, and medical equipment maintenance in accordance with the theater surgeon’s policy. The MEDLOG management center provides two forward support teams (early entry) and two forward support teams (follow-on). The MEDLOG management center is capable of deploying these teams, while maintaining base operations in CONUS. One forward support team (early entry) and one forward support team (follow-on) combine to make one complete forward support team. The forward support teams (follow-on) are not meant to deploy independently of the forward support team (early entry). One team is deployed per theater. When deployed, the forward support team is subordinate to the MEDCOM (DS) or senior medical headquarters (such as the MEDBDE [SPT]) and collocates with the distribution management center of the TSC/ESC. When so designated, the MEDLOG management center, with the MEDLOG Company, serves as the single integrated MEDLOG manager for joint operations. The MEDLOG management center also provides technical guidance to medical contracting personnel within the AO. Chapter 12 12-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 MEDICAL LOGISTICS COMPANY 12-4. The MEDLOG company provides medical materiel, field and limited sustainment medical equipment maintenance and repair, optical lens fabrication and repair, and patient movement items support to BCTs and EAB AHS units operating within the AO. One MEDLOG company is deployed per 13 short tons of Class VIII supplies per day and provides 220 hours of field-level maintenance per day. The MEDLOG Company can deploy one early entry team, three contact repair teams, and three forward distribution teams. The MEDLOG Company has no organic blood support capability. The MEDLOG Company has the capability for limited self-sustainment during initial operations, meeting the requirement for early entry into the AO or as part of a task force organization. The company is normally under the command of the headquarters and headquarters detachment, MMB. MEDICAL DETACHMENT (BLOOD SUPPORT) 12-5. The medical detachment (blood support) provides collection, manufacturing, storage, and distribution of blood and blood products for brigade and EAB AHS units and other Services as required. The detachment receives and stores up to 5,100 refrigerated and/or frozen blood products from CONUS or other U.S. MTFs and further distributes these products to supported MTFs and AHS units. This unit also coordinates the movement of blood and blood products and tracks shipments to ensure proper delivery. The detachment is assigned to the MMB. MEDICAL DETACHMENT OPTOMETRY 12-6. The medical detachment (optometry) provides optometry care and optical fabrication and repair support for brigade and EAB units on an area basis. The detachment consists of six personnel that can be divided into two teams. Each team is capable of providing optometry support to include routine eye examinations, refractions, optical fabrication, frame assembly, and repair services. The optometry detachment is assigned to the MEDCOM (DS) or MEDBDE (SPT) with further attachment to an MMB or BCT. PRIMARY TASKS 12-7.

The Defense Logistics Agency also coordinates these programs with the United States Transportation Command to enable direct delivery to Army medical materiel centers in theater without intermediate government inventory or handling.  The U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command is the Army’s medical materiel developer, with responsibility for medical research, development, and acquisition. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command manages and executes research in military infectious diseases, combat casualty care, military operational medicine, chemical biological defense, and clinical and rehabilitative medicine. The command’s product line includes vaccines, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, medical equipment, and information technology. They work Chapter 12 12-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 closely with Army Materiel Command’s Army Medical Logistics Command to ensure timely procurement and fielding of lifesaving products to the deployed force.  The U. S. Army Materiel Command is the Army’s materiel integrator providing national-level sustainment, acquisition integration support, contracting support, and selected logistics support to Army forces. Army Materiel Command provides related common support to other Services, multinational, and interagency partners. Army Materiel Command’s capabilities are diverse and are accomplished through its various major subordinate commands which include the Army Medical Logistics Command for strategic-level medical logistics support. Refer to FM 4-0 for additional information. 12-11. The U.S. Army Medical Logistics Command is the life cycle management command for MEDLOG. The Army Medical Logistics Command manages and sustains medical programs for operational forces in the Total Army and delivers/fields medical solutions (on behalf of the Army Medical Program Executive Office). The command manages strategic-level medical materiel and logistics services required to generate and deploy ready medical forces and sustain Army and Joint health services. The Army Medical Logistics Command’s core competencies include management of medical supply (Class VIIIA), MEDLOG operations that include theater-level medical logistics support, medical equipment maintenance and recapitalization, optical fabrication, and the Army’s globally employed centralized medical materiel readiness programs. The Army Medical Logistics Command’s subordinate organizations include the:  U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency  U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center-Europe  U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center-Korea 12-12. The U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency’s mission is to develop, tailor, deliver and sustain medical materiel capabilities and provide worldwide operational MEDLOG support. The Agency has a wide range of strategic roles including materiel fielding, centrally managed MEDLOG programs, Army supply cataloging and set assembly, and medical equipment maintenance and repair. The U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency has two deployable teams: the MEDLOG Support Team and the Forward Repair Activity- Medical Team.  The MEDLOG support team is a deployable table of distribution and allowances organization consisting of MEDLOG personnel military, DA Civilians, and contractors. The mission of the MEDLOG support team is to deploy to designated locations worldwide, to provide medical materiel and medical equipment maintenance capabilities and solutions in support of Army strategic and contingency programs. Upon initial deployment for hand-off of Army Pre-positioned Stock, the MEDLOG support team is normally under the operational control of the United States Army Materiel Command’s Army field support brigade. The primary role of the MEDLOG support team is the issue of medical Army pre-positioned stocks, unit sets, and sustainment stocks pre-positioned around the world. After completing the Army Pre-positioned Stocks transfer or other assigned mission, the MEDLOG support team redeploys to CONUS.Refer to ATP 4-02.1 for additional information.  The Forward Repair Activity-Medical Team provides sustainment-level medical equipment maintenance support and technical expertise to deployed medical units in theater. The team is operated as a deployable section with the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency depot-level maintenance activities to extend sustainment maintenance capabilities to augment theater intermediate-level organizations as required. The members of the Forward Repair Activity- Medical Team are technical experts in one of five commodities including laboratory equipment, pulmonary, oxygen generation, anesthesia equipment, or medical imaging systems. The team may deploy as part of the MEDLOG support team for issue of medical Army Pre-positioned Stock. Upon completion of the Army Pre-positioned Stock transfer, the team may redeploy to CONUS or remain to augment theater medical equipment maintenance capabilities under the operational control of the theater medical materiel center. 12-13. The U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center-Europe provides and projects MEDLOG support across the competition continuum to the U.S. European Command, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Africa Command, and the U.S. Department of State. Medical Logistics 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 12-5 12-14. The U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center-Korea serves as U.S. Forces Korea’s theater lead agent for medical materiel and is responsible for ensuring that tactical units are integrated into the medical supply chain. The Medical Materiel Center also assists the CCDR in MEDLOG support planning and contributes to the Eighth Army’s medical readiness by managing and fielding countermeasures used to protect and treat Soldiers in the event of a CBRN attack. SECTION IV — MEDICAL LOGISTICS SUPPORT FOR ROLES 1 AND 2 MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITIES 12-15. The Class VIII supply functions for AHS units/elements operating Roles 1 and 2 MTFs are primarily the management of medical equipment sets, basic ordering for replenishment, and field-level medical equipment maintenance and repair support. Within the BCT, these functions are performed by the brigade medical supply office of the brigade support medical company and the MEDLOG Company operating at echelons above brigade. Refer to ATP 4-02.1 for information on MEDLOG. SECTION V — MEDICAL LOGISTICS SUPPORT FOR ROLE 3 MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITIES 12-16. Theater hospitalization is provided by Army Role 3 CSHs and hospital centers operating at EAB. Class VIII support for Role 3 MTFs is a vital part of its mission and includes management of a commodity that must be adapted to specific theater health care requirements distribution plans and capabilities provided by sustainment organizations. 12-17. During port operations and reception, staging, onward movement, and integration these AHS units must be capable of operations immediately upon initial entry of forces. Therefore, MEDLOG support must be included in planning for port opening and early entry operations. Port operations may also include the issue of AHS unit sets from Army Pre-positioned Stocks as well as integration of potency and dated items, refrigerated, and controlled substances. In almost every operation, lessons learned reflect that theater MEDLOG units must also provide Class VIII materiel for unit shortages that were not filled prior to unit deployment. 12-18. Class VIII sustainment of CSHs and hospital centers present the most complex medical materiel requirements and may consume materiel at a tremendous rate when providing trauma care in support of operations. Specialty care for burn injuries, orthopedic injuries and surgeries, and neurosurgery often require materiel and equipment that is not standard and may not have been anticipated or stocked in sufficient quantities prior to deployment. Combat support hospitals are typically made direct customers of a MEDLOG company/element that is capable of meeting the unit’s mission requirements. 12-19. Theater hospitalization is provided by CSHs and hospital centers that operate Role 3 MTFs. Army CSHs and hospital centers are located at EAB. Role 3 MTF and forward surgical teams/forward resuscitative surgical detachments deployed from the CSH or hospital center are dependent on their supporting MEDLOG Company for Class VIII resupply and medical equipment maintenance and repair, and the medical detachment (blood support) for distribution of blood and blood products. SECTION VI — MEDICAL LOGISTICS SUPPORT TO JOINT HEALTH SERVICES 12-20. Theater lead agent for medical materiel is an organization or unit designated to serve as a major theater medical distribution node and provide the customer support interface for MEDLOG and supply chain management. The designation of a Service organization to serve as the theater lead agent for medical material (TLAMM) is a critical element of the Defense Logistics Agency’s implementation of the Executive Agent for Medical Materiel. A TLAMM operates in the DOD medical supply chain using business processes and systems developed and standardized by the Defense Logistics Agency and Military Health System to promote effectiveness and efficiency. According to DODI 5101.15, the Defense Logistics Agency Director, in coordination with the CCDR, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretaries of the Military Chapter 12 12-6 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 Departments, recommend the designation of a TLAMM as necessary to ensure effective and efficient medical supply chain support to the CCDR. Once designated, the unit serving as the TLAMM remains within the chain of command of their parent organization (such as the parent combatant command, DOD component, or other headquarters element). As designated TLAMMs, the Army’s theater medical materiel centers use DOD standard business processes and systems to provide theater-level Class VIIIA supply support to joint forces operating in their supported area of responsibility. 12-21. Title 10, United States Code requires that each Service provide its own logistics support, which makes MEDLOG support a Service responsibility. However, in joint operations, a CCDR may assign specific common user logistics functions, to include both planning and execution, to a lead Service. The Army is typically the predominant provider of forces in unified land operations and owns the preponderance of MEDLOG capability. Therefore, CCDRs often assign the ASCC (or Army component of a joint task force) responsibility to plan and execute MEDLOG support to all Services and multinational partners (when directed) operating in the theater. This function is known as SIMLM support. When assigning SIMLM responsibility, the CCDR specifies the scope and duration of MEDLOG support to be provided (such as medical supply, medical equipment maintenance, or optical fabrication). The performance of SIMLM responsibilities requires close coordination with the ASCC surgeon, MEDCOM (DS), and medical elements of the supported Services to ensure mutual understanding of requirements, expectations, and processes for MEDLOG support. Refer to ATP 4-02.1 and JP 4-02 for additional information. 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 A-1 Appendix A Army Health System Support to the Army’s Strategic Roles The Army's primary mission is to organize, train, and equip its forces to conduct prompt and sustained land combat to defeat enemy ground forces and seize, occupy, and defend land areas. The Army accomplishes its mission by supporting the joint force in four strategic roles: shape OEs, prevent conflict, conduct large-scale ground combat operations, and consolidate gains. For more information on the Army’s strategic roles, refer to FM 3-0. SHAPE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS A-1. Shaping activities are continuous within an area of responsibility. The CCDR (command authority) uses them to improve security within partner nations, enhance international legitimacy, gain multinational cooperation, and influence adversary decision making. This cooperation includes information exchange and intelligence sharing, obtaining access for U.S. forces in peacetime and crisis, and mitigating conditions that could lead to a crisis. A-2. Army forces conduct operations to shape OEs with various unified action partners through careful coordination and synchronization facilitated by the theater army through the GCC, and when authorized, directly with the partner nation's military forces. Army forces provide security cooperation capabilities area of responsibility-wide, including building defense and security relationships and partner military capacity through exercises and engagements, gaining or maintaining access to populations, supporting infrastructure through assistance visits, and fulfilling EA responsibilities. Military-to-military contacts and exchanges, joint and combined exercises, various long-term persistent military engagements, and other security cooperation activities provide the foundation of the GCC's theater campaign plan. Key medical considerations in support of operations to shape include:  Regionally focused medical command and control to promote unity of purpose of all engaged medical assets.  Medical information management to document health threat exposures and medical encounters, to report health surveillance data and information on the health of the command, and to accomplish medical regulating and patient tracking operations.  Traditional medical support to a deployed force engaged in performing these tasks.  Medical expertise and consultation to enhance building partnership capacity in public, private, and military health sectors of the host nation.  Development of regional theater security cooperation plans aimed at mitigating or resolving the underlying causes of health issues prevalent within the region.  Army Health System support for maintenance and execution of medical support agreements.  Home station medical readiness and training activities, and tailored force generation of medical combat power.  Army medical support to other Services and unified action partners, as well as assessment and release of theater Army prepositioned stocks and other medical logistics support.  Capability gaps and determine mitigation plan.  Theater evacuation policy adjustments.  Coordination with USTRANSCOM for patient movement plans.  Integration and interoperability of theater medical capabilities.  Army Health System support to foreign humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  Medical preparation of the OE. Appendix A A-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 A-3. See Figure A-1 for an example depiction of AHS support during operations to shape. Figure A-1. Army Health System support during operations to shape PREVENT CONFLICT A-4. The intent of operations to prevent is to deter adversary actions and stop further deterioration of a particular situation. Prevent activities enable the joint force to gain positions of relative advantage prior to future combat operations. Operations to prevent are characterized by actions to protect friendly forces and indicate the intent to execute subsequent phases of a planned operation. With the shift from shaping to deterrence, the theater army shifts to refining contingency plans and preparing estimates for land power based on GCC's guidance. The theater army and subordinate  Army forces perform the following major activities during operations to prevent:  Execute flexible deterrent options and flexible response options.  Set the theater.  Tailor Army forces.  Project the force. A-5. The AHS support during operations to prevent includes coordination, integration, and synchronization of strategic medical capabilities from the U.S. sustaining base, global health engagements, establishment and maintenance of medical support agreements, as well as the following:  Executing AHS support to other Services when directed.  Recommending theater evacuation policy adjustments.  Providing theater food protection support.  Coordinating with USTRANSCOM for patient movement plans.  Ensuring integration and interoperability of theater medical capabilities.  Conducting medical preparation of the OE. Army Health System Support to the Army’s Strategic Roles 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 A-3  Maximizing use of host-nation medical capabilities.  Establishing and executing OEH surveillance programs and countermeasures.  Coordinating with the National Center for Medical Intelligence, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other strategic partners for identification and mitigation of regional health threats.  Planning and coordination for AHS support to—  Noncombatant evacuation operations.  Detainee operations.  Reception, staging, onward movement, and integration, and theater opening.  Large-scale casualty events and prolonged care.  Other Services. A-6. See Figure A-2 for an example depiction of AHS support during operations to prevent. Figure A-2. Army Health System support during operations to prevent CONDUCT LARGE SCALE GROUND COMBAT OPERATIONS A-7. During large-scale ground combat operations, Army forces defeat the enemy. Defeat of enemy forces in close-combat operations is normally required to achieve campaign objectives and national strategic goals after the commencement of hostilities. Planning for sequels to consolidate gains at higher levels should be informed by combat operations and vice versa. However, the demands of large-scale ground combat operations consume all available staff capability at the tactical level. A-8. In large-scale ground combat operations against a peer threat, commanders conduct decisive action to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. This involves the orchestration of many simultaneous unit actions in the most demanding of operational environments. Large-scale ground combat operations introduce levels of complexity, lethality, ambiguity, and speed to military activities not common in other operations. Large- Appendix A A-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 scale ground combat operations require the execution of multiple tasks synchronized and converged across multiple domains to create opportunities to destroy, dislocate, disintegrate, and isolate enemy forces. A-9. Army forces defeat enemy organizations, control terrain, protect populations, and preserve joint force and unified action partner freedom of movement and action in the land and other domains. Commanders are directly concerned with those enemy forces and capabilities that can affect their current and future operations. Medical command and control gives subordinate medical units at all echelons the freedom to provide a rapid response to acquire wounded, injured, and ill personnel clearing the battlefield of casualties and facilitating and enhancing the tactical commander's freedom of movement and maneuver. A-10. Large-scale ground combat operations place a significant burden on medical resources due to the magnitude and lethality of the forces involved. Medical units must anticipate large numbers of casualties in a short period of time due to the capabilities of modern conventional weapons and the possible employment of weapons of mass destruction. These mass casualty situations can rapidly exceed the capabilities of medical assets. Careful planning and coordination is necessary to minimize the extent to which medical capabilities are overwhelmed. Casualty evacuation must occur concurrently with operations. Units that cease aggressive maneuver to evacuate casualties while in enemy contact are likely to both suffer additional casualties while stationary and fail their mission. Effective management of mass casualty situations depends on established and rehearsed unit-level mass casualty plans. There are a number of other variables which can ensure the success of a unit's mass casualty response. These include, but are not limited to:  Coordination of additional medical support and augmentation of- medical evacuation support, forward resuscitative and surgical detachments, combat support and field hospitals, casualty collection points, ambulance exchange points, and established Class VIII resupply.  Rapid clearance of casualties from the battlefield (independent of MEDEVAC).  Providing effective tactical combat casualty care for the injured.  Continuous flow of casualties to the MTFs at the next higher role of care.  Use of alternative assets when the number of casualties overwhelms the capacity of available medical evacuation systems. A-11. The AHS support during large-scale ground combat operations include but not limited to:  Provide organic Roles 1 and 2 medical treatment and on an area basis.  Provide Role 3 medical treatment.  Medical evacuation and/or CASEVAC from POI to MTF.  Intra/Intertheater patient movement (between medical treatment facilities).  Provide forward resuscitative surgery to stabilize nontransportable patients for evacuation out of theater.  Emergency movement of Class VIII (to include blood), medical personnel, and medical equipment.  Coordinate medical evacuation plan with the combat aviation brigade for air ambulance support.  Coordinate with United States Air Force for strategic aeromedical evacuation and medical regulating.  Manage patient movement items.  Conduct medical and OEH surveillance.  Conduct health risk assessment and communications.  Provide veterinary medical treatment for MWDs and government-owned animals.  Force rotation (reception, staging, onward movement, and integration). Sustainment of AHS support operations (possible nontraditional sources of support from other Services, multinational forces, or host nation without habitual support relationships).  Unit reconstitution may be accomplished using modular teams.  Care for detainees (increased requirements for public health support, primary care, care of chronic diseases/conditions). A-12. See Figure A-3 for an example depiction of AHS support during large-scale ground combat operations. Army Health System Support to the Army’s Strategic Roles 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 A-5 Figure A-3. Army Health System support during large-scale ground combat operations CONSOLIDATE GAINS A-13. Army forces provide the joint force commander the ability to capitalize on operational success by consolidating gains. Consolidate gains is an integral part of winning armed conflict and achieving success across the competition continuum. It is essential to retaining the initiative over determined enemies and adversaries. Army forces reinforce and integrate the efforts of all unified action partners when they consolidate gains. A-14. Army forces consolidate gains in support of a host nation and its civilian population, or as part of the pacification of a hostile state. These gains may include the establishment of public security temporarily by using the military as a transitional force, the relocation of displaced civilians, reestablishment of law and order, performance of humanitarian assistance, and restoration of key infrastructure. Concurrently, corps and divisions must be able to accomplish these activities while sustaining, repositioning, and reorganizing subordinate units to continue operations in the close area. Refer to ATP 3-91 and ATP 3-92 for more information. A-15. Upon successful termination of large-scale ground combat operations, Army forces in the close area transition rapidly to the conduct of consolidation of gains activities. Alternatively, they may be relieved in place by another unit. Consolidation of gains activities may encompass a lengthy period of post conflict operations prior to redeployment. This transition to consolidation of gains may occur even if large-scale ground combat operations are occurring in other parts of an AO in order to exploit tactical success. Anticipation and early planning for activities after large-scale ground combat operations ease the transition process. A-16. The joint force commander defines the conditions to which an AO is to be stabilized. The theater army is normally the overseer of the orderly transition of authority to appropriate U.S., international, interagency, or host-nation agencies. The theater army and subordinate commanders emphasize those activities that Appendix A A-6 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 reduce post-conflict or post-crisis turmoil and help stabilize a situation. Commanders address the decontamination, disposal, and destruction of war materiel. They address the removal and destruction of unexploded ordnance and the responsibility for demining operations. A-17. The consolidation of friendly and available enemy mine field reports is critical to this mission. Additionally, the theater army must be prepared to provide AHS support, emergency restoration of utilities, support to social needs of the indigenous population, and other humanitarian activities as required. (See ADP 3-07 and FM 3-07 for more information on the performance of stability tasks). Army Health System support during operations to consolidate gains includes but not limited to:  Coordinate, integrate, and synchronize AHS resources into the interagency efforts. Provide medical expertise to identify and analyze critical needs emerging within the operational area.  Manage medical information to facilitate medical regulating of victims to facilities outside of the operational area and to document medical treatment.  Assist affected host nation medical infrastructure in saving lives, reducing long-term disability, and alleviating human suffering.  Assist the local government in conducting rescue operations and providing medical evacuation of victims to facilities capable of providing the required care.  Advise local animal, agricultural, and veterinary industry personnel; assess damage of veterinary and animal infrastructure; and provide animal medical care to local animals.  Conduct preventive measures to respond to and resolve emerging health threats caused by the LSCO.  Conduct health risk assessment and communications.  Assist host nation to reestablish its own ability to provide medical services for its population to a reasonable level it possessed prior to hostilities and to support the legitimacy of the host nation.  Continue to assess running estimates and be prepared to provide all aspects of roles of medical care while reducing capacities in support of redeployment operations and downsizing the footprint in theater (for example, reducing the number of intensive care unit and intermediate care ward beds). A-18. See Figure A-4 (on page A-7) for an example depiction of AHS support during operations to consolidate gains.

Army Health System support during operations to consolidate gains This page intentionally left blank. 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 B-1 Appendix B Command and Support Relationship This appendix is derived from FM 3-0. It discusses command and support relationships for joint and Army forces. This appendix delineates the four types of joint command relationships, Army command relationships, and Army command support relationships. Command and support relationships provide the basis for unity of command and unity of effort in operations. FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS B-1. Establishing clear command and support relationships is a key aspect of any operation. Large-scale combat operations present unique and complex challenges that demand well-defined command and support relationships among units. These relationships establish responsibilities and authorities between subordinate and supporting units. Some command and support relationships limit the commander's authority to prescribe additional relationships. Knowing the inherent responsibilities of each command and support relationship allows commanders to effectively organize their forces and helps supporting commanders understand their unit's role in the organizational structure. JOINT COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS B-2. As part of a joint force, Army commanders and staffs must understand joint command relationships. JP 1 specifies and details four types of joint command relationships:  Combatant command (command authority).  Operational control (OPCON).  Tactical control (TACON).  Support. COMBATANT COMMAND (COMMAND AUTHORITY) B-3. Combatant command is a unified or specified command with a broad continuing mission under a single commander established and so designated by the President, through the Secretary of Defense and with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JP 1). Title 10, United States Code, section 164 specifies this authority in law. Normally, the CCDR exercises this authority through subordinate JFCs, Service component commanders, and functional component commanders. OPERATIONAL CONTROL B-4. Operational control is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission (JP 1). Operational control normally includes authority over all aspects of operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions. It does not include directive authority for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. The CCDR must specifically delegate these elements of COCOM. Operational control does include the authority to delineate functional responsibilities and operational areas of subordinate JFCs. In two instances, the Secretary of Defense may specify adjustments to accommodate authorities beyond OPCON in an establishing directive- when transferring forces between CCDRs or when transferring members or organizations from the military departments to a combatant command. Adjustments will be coordinated with the participating CCDRs. Appendix B B-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 TACTICAL CONTROL B-5. Tactical control is the authority over forces that is limited to the detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers within the operational area necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned (JP 1). Tactical control is inherent in OPCON. It may be delegated to and exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Tactical control provides sufficient authority for controlling and directing the application of force or tactical use of combat support assets within the assigned mission or task. Tactical control does not provide organizational authority or authoritative direction for administrative and logistic support; the commander of the parent unit continues to exercise these authorities unless otherwise specified in the establishing directive. SUPPORT B-6. Support is the action of a force that aids, protects, complements, or sustains another force in accordance with a directive requiring such action (JP 1). Support is a command authority in joint doctrine. A supported and supporting relationship is established by a superior commander between subordinate commanders when one organization should aid, protect, complement, or sustain another force. Designating supporting relationships is important. It conveys priorities to commanders and staffs planning or executing joint operations. Designating a support relationship does not provide authority to organize and employ commands and forces, nor does it include authoritative direction for administrative and logistic support. Joint doctrine divides support into the categories listed in Table B-1 (page B-3). ARMY COMMAND AND SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS B-7. As discussed in Chapter 2, Army command relationships include:  Organic.  Assigned.  Attached.  OPCON.  TACON. B-8. See Table B-1 (on page B-3) for an illustration of Army command relationships. ORGANIC B-9. Organic forces are those assigned to and forming an essential part of a military organization as listed in its table of organization for the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and are assigned to the operating forces for the Navy (JP 1). Joint command relationships do not include organic because a JFC is not responsible for the organizational structure of units. That is a Service responsibility. B-10. The Army establishes organic command relationships through organizational documents such as tables of organization and equipment and tables of distribution and allowances. If temporarily task-organized with another headquarters, organic units return to the control of their organic headquarters after completing the mission. To illustrate, within a BCT, all subordinate battalions are included on the BCT table of organization and equipment. In contrast, within most functional and multifunctional brigades, there is a base of organic battalions and companies and a variable mix of assigned and attached battalions and companies. ASSIGNED B-11. Assign is to place units or personnel in an organization where such placement is relatively permanent, and/or where such organization controls and administers the units or personnel for the primary function, or greater portion of the functions, of the unit or personnel (JP 3-0). Unless specifically stated, this relationship includes administrative control (ADCON). Command and Support Relationship 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 B-3 Table B-1.

(See TACON.) ADCON administrative control HQ headquarters AO area of operations N/A not applicable ASCC Army Service component command NATO North Atlantic Treaty Organization DS direct support OPCON operation control GS general support R reinforcing GSR general support-reinforcing TACON tactical control ATTACHED B-12. Attach is the placement of units or personnel in an organization where such placement is relatively temporary (JP 3-0). A unit may be temporarily placed into an organization for the purpose of conducting a specific operation of short duration. Attached units return to their parent headquarters (assigned or organic) when the reason for the attachment ends. The Army headquarters that receives another Army unit through assignment or attachment assumes responsibility for the ADCON requirements, and particularly sustainment, that normally extend down to that echelon, unless modified by directives. Appendix B B-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 OPERATIONAL AND TACTICAL CONTROL B-13. For discussion on OPCON and TACON, refer to joint command relationship above. ARMY SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS B-14. Table B-2 (page B-5) lists Army support relationships. As discussed in Chapter 2, the Army support relationships are-  Direct support.  General support.  Reinforcing.  General support-reinforcing. B-15. Commanders assign a support relationship for several reasons. They include when-  The support is more effective if a commander with the requisite technical and tactical expertise controls the supporting unit rather than the supported commander.  The echelon of the supporting unit is the same as or higher than that of the supported unit. For example, the supporting unit may be a brigade, and the supported unit may be a battalion. It would be inappropriate for the brigade to be subordinated to the battalion; hence, the echelon uses an Army support relationship.  The supporting unit supports several units simultaneously. The requirement to set support priorities to allocate resources to supported units exists. Assigning support relationships is one aspect of mission command. B-16. Army support relationships allow supporting commanders to employ their units' capabilities to achieve results required by supported commanders. Support relationships are graduated from an exclusive supported and supporting relationship between two units-as in direct support-to a broad level of support extended to all units under the control of the higher headquarters-as in general support. Support relationships do not alter administrative control. Commanders specify and change support relationships through task organization. B-17. Direct support is a support relationship requiring a force to support another specific force and authorizing it to answer directly to the supported force's request for assistance. A unit assigned a direct support relationship retains its command relationship with its parent unit, but it is positioned by and has priorities of support established by the supported unit. (Joint doctrine considers direct support a mission rather than a support relationship.) A field artillery unit in direct support of a maneuver unit is concerned primarily with the fire support needs of only that unit. The fires cell of the supported maneuver unit plans and coordinates fires to support the maneuver commander's intent. The commander of a unit in direct support recommends position areas and coordinates for movement clearances where the unit can best support the maneuver commander's concept of the operation. B-18. General support is that support which is given to the supported force as a whole. It is not given to any particular subdivision of the force. Units assigned a general support relationship are positioned and have priorities established by their parent unit. A field artillery unit assigned in general support of a force has all of its fires under the immediate control of the supported commander or the designated force field artillery headquarters. B-19. Reinforcing is a support relationship requiring a force to support another supporting unit. Only like units (for example, artillery to artillery) can be given a reinforcing mission. A unit assigned a reinforcing support relationship retains its command relationship with its parent unit, but it is positioned by the reinforced unit. A unit that is reinforcing has priorities of support established by the reinforced unit, then the parent unit.For example, when a direct support field artillery battalion requires more fires to meet maneuver force requirements, another field artillery battalion may be directed to reinforce the direct support battalion.

B-20. General support-reinforcing is a support relationship assigned to a unit to support the force as a whole and to reinforce another similar-type unit. A unit assigned a general support-reinforcing support relationship is positioned and has its priorities established by its parent unit and secondly by the reinforced unit. For example, an artillery unit that has a general-support-reinforcing relationship supports the force as a whole and provides reinforcing fires for other artillery units. ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL B-21. Administrative control is direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organizations in respect to administration and support (JP 1). ADCON is not a command or support relationship; it is a Service authority. It is exercised under the authority of and is delegated by the Secretary of the Army. ADCON is synonymous with the Army's Title 10 authorities and responsibilities. B-22. ADCON responsibilities of Army forces involve the entire Army, and they are distributed between the Army institutional force and the operating forces. The institutional force consists of those Army organizations whose primary mission is to generate and sustain the operating force's capabilities for employment by JFCs. Operating forces consist of those forces whose primary missions are to participate in combat and the integral supporting elements thereof. Often, commanders in the operating force and commanders in the institutional force subdivide specific responsibilities. Army institutional force capabilities and organizations are linked to operating forces through co-location and reachback. B-23. The ASCC is always the senior Army headquarters assigned to a CCDR. Its commander exercises command authorities as assigned by the CCDR and ADCON as delegated by the Secretary of the Army. Appendix B B-6 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 ADCON is the Army's authority to administer and support Army forces even while in a combatant command area of responsibility. The COCOM is the basic authority for command and control of the same Army forces. The Army is obligated to meet the CCDR's requirements for the operating forces. Essentially, ADCON directs the Army's support of operating force requirements. B-24. Unless modified by the Secretary of the Army, administrative responsibilities normally flow from the Department of the Army through the ASCC to those Army forces assigned or attached to that combatant command. ASCCs usually "share" ADCON for at least some administrative or support functions. "Shared ADCON" refers to the internal allocation of Title 10, U.S. Code, section 3013(b) responsibilities and functions. This is especially true for Reserve Component forces. Certain administrative functions, such as pay, stay with the Reserve Component headquarters, even after unit mobilization. Shared ADCON also applies to direct reporting units of the Army that typically perform single or unique functions. The direct reporting unit, rather than the ASCC, typically manages individual and unit training for these units. The Secretary of the Army directs shared ADCON. 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 C-1 Appendix C Surgeon and Surgeon Section Organizations from battalion through ASCC level are authorized a surgeon. Army Medicine leverages the chain of surgeon's cells (staff channels) and medical command and control channels (MEDCOM [(DS], MEDBDE [SPT], and [MMB]) to provide AHS support to the deployed force. Integration of these two channels and other warfighting function elements occur at command headquarters (HQs) at different echelons. The surgeon is a member of the commander’s personal and special staff. Through medical command and control, the surgeon coordinates and synchronizes the medical functions within the protection and sustainment warfighting functions and serves as a link between these varied commands and staffs. Surgeons at the ASCC/theater, corps, division, and brigade level are authorized a surgeon staff. The surgeon’s staff is considered special staff and executes the actions required of the surgeon. The surgeon and the surgeon sections at each echelon work with their commands and staffs to conduct planning, coordination, synchronization, and integration of AHS support. This ensures the consideration of all ten medical functions is included in the command’s running estimates, OPLANs, and OPORDs. SURGEON C-1. The surgeon is a Medical Corps officer and member of the commander’s personal and special staff. The surgeon normally work under the staff supervision of the chief of staff/executive officer. The surgeon is responsible for coordinating health assets and operations within the command. This officer provides and oversees medical care to Soldiers, civilians, and detainees. The surgeon prepares Appendix 9 (Force Health Protection) of Annex E (Protection) and Appendix 3 (Health Service Support) of Annex F (Sustainment) to the operation order or operation plan. If operating in a joint headquarters (Theater/Corps), they have the responsibility of writing Annex Q (Medical Services) to the joint operation order or operation plan (Refer to JP 4-02, Joint Health Services). The surgeon advises the commander and their staff on all medical or medical- related issues. The surgeon’s responsibilities include, but are not limited to:  Advises the commander on the health of the command.  Responsible for the creation of or contribution to the medical common operating picture and medical concept of support.  Provides medical treatment (to include CBRN).  Provides status of the wounded.  Coordinates MEDEVAC including Army dedicated MEDEVAC platforms (air and ground).  Determines requirements for the requisition, procurement, storage, maintenance, distribution management, and documentation of Class VIII supplies within the organization.  Plans for and implements operational public health (including initiating measures to counter the health threat, and establishing medical and OEH surveillance).  Advises on the effects of the health threat on personnel, rations, and water. Appendix C C-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020  Advises on health threat requirements including the examination, processing of captured medical supplies, and recommending use of captured medical supplies in support of detainees and other recipients.  Coordinates dental services.  Coordinates COSC.  Ensures the establishment of a viable veterinary services program (including inspection of subsistence and outside the continental U.S. food production and bottled water facilities, veterinary preventive medicine, and animal medical care).  Ensures an area medical laboratory capability or procedures for obtaining this support from out of theater resources are established for the identification and confirmation of the use of suspect biological and chemical warfare agents by opposition forces. This includes the capability for specimens and samples, packaging and establishing handling requirements, and escort and chain of custody requirements.  Coordinates clinical laboratory capabilities, including blood banking.  Advises how operations affect the public health of personnel and the indigenous populations.  Provides recommendations on allocation, redistribution, determining requirements, and assignment of medical personnel.  Coordinates with medical unit commanders (to include leaders of medical platoons and sections) for continuous AHS support.  Provides consultation, mentoring, and technical supervision of subordinate surgeons, physicians, and physician assistants.  Submits to higher HQs those recommendations on professional medical problems that require research and development.  Determines AHS training requirements and provides health education and training.  Ensures field medical records and/or electronic medical records, when available, are maintained on each Solder at the primary MTF according to AR 40-66.  Assessing  special equipment and procedures required to accomplish the AHS mission in specific environments such as urban operations, mountainous terrain, extreme cold weather operations, jungles, and deserts, requirements varies depending upon the scenario, and could include:  Obtaining pieces of equipment of clothing not usually carries (piton hammers, extreme cold weather parka, jungle boots, or the like)  Adapting medical equipment sets for a specific scenario to include adding items based on the forecasted types of injuries to be encountered (such as more crushing injuries and fractures in urban operations or mountain operations). In certain scenarios (such as urban operations), some medical supplies and equipment may not be carried into the fight initially (such as sick call materials), but rather brought forward by follow-on forces. In mountain operations, bulky or heavy items (such as extra tentage) may not accompany the force because of the difficulty in traversing the terrain.  Having individual Soldiers carry additional medical items, such as bandages and intravenous fluids. C-2. Through medical command and control, the surgeon coordinates and synchronizes the medical functions within the protection and sustainment warfighting functions and serves as a link between these varied commands and staffs (See Figure C-1; on page C-3). C-3.

Medical intelligence results from collection, evaluation, analysis, and interpretation of foreign medical, bioscientific, and environmental information that is of interest to strategic planning and to military medical planning. This information is pertinent to operations for the conservation of the fighting strength of friendly forces and the formation of assessments of foreign medical capabilities in both military and civilian sectors. Military intelligence includes only finished intelligence products produced by an authorized agency. Military Intelligence Soldiers and other intelligence professionals, through the intelligence warfighting function, collect, process and exploit, analyze, disseminate, and evaluate information collected from a variety of sources to generate intelligence. Medical elements require intelligence support in order to not lose the medical personnel's protected status under Article 24 of the1949 Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the field by performing tasks that are inconsistent with their noncombatant role such as intelligence collection. To develop medical intelligence, information is gathered, evaluated, and analyzed on the following subjects:  Endemic, emerging, epidemic and pandemic diseases, public health standards and capabilities, and the quality and availability of medical services.  Foreign military and civilian medical capabilities, including MTFs, medical personnel, emergency and disaster responses, MEDLOG (to include blood processing), and medical pharmaceutical industries.  Integrated databases on all medical treatment, training, pharmaceutical, and research and production facilities.  Environmental risks that can degrade force health or effectiveness including: chemical and microbial contamination of the environment, toxic industrial materials and radiation accidents, and environmental terrorism.  Impact of foreign environmental health issues and trends on environmental security and national policy.  Infectious disease risks that can degrade mission effectiveness of deployed forces.  Foreign and applied biomedical and biotechnological developments of military medical importance.  Foreign scientific and technological medical advances for defense against CBRN warfare agents. SIGNIFICANCE OF MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE D-1. At the strategic level, the objective of medical intelligence is to contribute to the formulation of national-based policy. The policy will be based in part on assessments of foreign military and civilian capabilities of the medical or bioscientific community. D-2. At the operational level, the objective of medical intelligence is to support the development of AHS strategies that—  Identify the health threat.  Are responsive to the unique aspects of a particular AO. Appendix D D-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020  Enable the commander to accomplish the operation.  Conserve the fighting strength of friendly forces. SOURCES OF MEDICAL INTELLIGENCE D-3. Medical intelligence is provided to the AHS planner by intelligence organizations. The AHS planner must identify the medical intelligence requirements and provide a request for information and or updated commander's critical information requirements and other requirements to the supporting intelligence element within the command. Up-to-date medical intelligence assessments can be obtained by contacting Director, Defense Intelligence Agency, Attention: Director, National Center for Medical Intelligence, Fort Detrick, Maryland 21702-5000 or via the contact information listed at:  https://www.ncmi.detrick.army.mil. The National Center for Medical Intelligence can provide finished all-source intelligence products that assess foreign medical facilities and capabilities; infectious disease/chemical/radiological health threats in the operational environment; foreign CBRN medical countermeasures; and emerging and disruptive biotechnology with military applications. The AHS planner should use all available intelligence elements to obtain information and intelligence which supports the military operation. The National Center for Medical Intelligence 24-hour service request for information telephone number is commercial (301) 619-7574 or Defense Switched Network 343-7574. Refer to DODI 6420.01 for more information. D-4. A supporting intelligence element exists in the AHS unit's chain of command. This element will be the primary source for the AHS planner to access the necessary intelligence for the execution of AHS support operations. MEDICAL ASPECTS OF INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE BATTLEFIELD D-5. Consideration of the medical aspects of the IPB is a systematic process that is designed to aid AHS planners in analyzing various enemy, environmental, and health threats in a specific AO. Determining the medical aspects of the IPB process occurs during the first step in the mission analysis phase of the military decision-making process. The information derived from conducting a proper assessment of the medical aspects of the intelligence is specific to the geographic region where the AO is located. The Phase I assessments that are part of the medical aspects of IPB are the cornerstone to developing detailed and effective AHS estimates and plans. Some portions of the template will be more or less applicable depending on the assigned mission. For more information on IPB, see ATP 2-01.3/MCRP 2-3A, Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield/Battlespace. D-6. The Phase I assessments that are part of the medical aspects of IPB are to—  Define the OE.  Describe the operational effects on deployed forces and AHS operations.  Conduct threat integration (enemy, environment, and health) and information consolidation. IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT D-7. The first task of the AHS planner is to define the OE. The AHS planner identifies and describes the significant characteristics of the environment to be able to assess the impact on AHS support operations and the health of the command. D-8. The significant characteristics of the OE must be evaluated from both a military perspective and a civilian perspective. The AHS planner must determine what aspects of the OE will impact the delivery of health care to U.S. forces and conversely what impact military medical operations will have on the civilian population in the AO. As the provision of medical care is a humanitarian activity, the patient workload of deployed forces can be affected when forces are deployed in medically underserved areas or in areas where the civilian medical infrastructure has been disrupted or is underdeveloped. The AHS planner can use the memory aid political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, time (operational variables) or mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations factors (mission variables) to frame the analysis of the OE based on the situation. Medical Intelligence 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 D-3 For the AHS planner, the civil considerations must be thoroughly explored and analyzed, even if the immediate mission does not recognize a requirement for the provision of health services to a host-nation population. The AHS planner must be prepared to provide support or have a plan in place in the event a civilian medical emergency should arise and the military forces are directed to provide support. Without prior planning, the diversion of military medical assets to support civilian medical emergencies will adversely impact the AHS support provided to deployed forces and could potentially overwhelm available medical resources. The AHS plan must not only conform to the tactical commander's concept of operation and scheme of maneuver, it must also be in consonance with the CCDRs theater engagement strategy so that any humanitarian activities conducted are not done haphazardly and are part of the regional strategy for the AO. GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION D-9. Geospatial information includes hydrological data, elevation data, soil composition, and vegetation. GEOGRAPHY AND WEATHER D-10. The geography and weather factors include climate, weather, terrain (to include urban terrain), and altitude. They may also contain information on possible weather/environmental threats such as earthquakes, volcanoes, monsoons, or other such conditions. CLIMATE AND WEATHER EFFECTS D-11. Information contained in the climate and weather effects includes the effects of extreme heat/cold/humidity; effects of the predominant weather patterns (such as monsoons) on AHS operations (such as MEDEVAC effects of heavy rains or snow; the phase of the moon and its effect on operations (such as fullness/brightness when military forces are infiltrating an area); how the weather may affect enemy biological and chemical warfare agents use; and climatic effects on medical supplies and equipment. TERRAIN ANALYSIS D-12. Terrain analysis includes determining the effect on friendly/enemy maneuver capability; effect on friendly/enemy ability to sustain health care; effects on timely MEDEVAC; and natural lines of patient drift. Lines of patient drift refers to natural routes along which wounded Soldiers may be expected to go back for medical care from a combat position. (ATP 4-02.2). Terrain analysis also impacts on MTF site selection factors; where the mobility corridors are located and their effects on friendly/enemy actions; effects of weather conditions on terrain/mobility; effect of overhead cover (canopy) and vegetation; effect of projected action on terrain/mobility; and where potential sources of potable water are located. ALTITUDE EFFECTS D-13. Altitude effects include effect of high-altitude operations on force capability, rotary-wing MEDEVAC assets, MEDEVAC procedures and methods (higher incidence of litter evacuation and longer evacuation times for manual evacuation), and standard medical treatment protocols. DESCRIBE THE BATTLEFIELD EFFECTS D-14. The purpose of this phase of the IPB process is to analyze and integrate various factors of the OE. Conducting a detailed analysis of these factors helps commanders and planners understand how the significant characteristics the OE can affect friendly and threat operations. The AHS planner will focus on identifying the medical aspects of battlefield effects on friendly and threat forces and operations. LIMITS OF COMMAND D-15. The AO is the geographic area where the commander is assigned the responsibility and authority to conduct military operations. The AHS planner must identify the—  Geographic AO that may include the macroview or the microview depending upon the level of command and the size of the geographic area. Appendix D D-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020  Total population at risk which includes all U.S. and unified action partners, local civilian population, dislocated persons, DOD and other U.S. governmental employees and or contractors, and nongovernmental organizations personnel. In addition to identifying the total population at risk, the planner must also determine what the supported population at risk is (those individuals/groups deemed as eligible beneficiaries for health care provided by United States Army medical assets. The supported population includes:  All supported U.S. units which include sister Services and elements from U.S. governmental agencies and DOD contractors.  All supported multinational units/elements. This paragraph should discuss unit troop strengths, locations, and missions. It may also include organic medical resources and capabilities; multinational medical assets (military, paramilitary, and civilian) which are approved for use for U.S. personnel; identification of multinational (military, paramilitary, and civilian) requirements; identification of unique medical support requirements (such as endemic diseases in the multinational force that are not present in the deployment [host nation] AO); and the current level of health and dental fitness among the supported populations. For veterinary services, the number of military working and contract dogs and other government owned animals that will be used by the multinational force also need to be identified and included in planning.  All personnel in U.S. custody (detainees).  Others as directed. LIMITS OF THE AREA OF INFLUENCE AND THE AREA OF INTEREST D-16. The area of influence and the area of interest are geographic areas from which information is required to facilitate planning. The area of influence and the area of interest usually fall outside the AO and may or may not be applicable to a particular operation. Army Health System support outside the AO includes:  Army Health System support provided by organizations/elements outside of the AO. This can include organizations such as CONUS-support base or other safe haven hospitals, MEDLOG support (Defense Logistics Agency or Army Materiel Command), and global patient regulating support (such as the Global Patient Movement Requirements Center).  Location and time/distance factors for medical resources that could be used for augmenting/ reinforcing/reconstituting AHS units/personnel within the AO. This information can include discussions on units/elements in the CONUS-support base or adjacent AOs.  Coordination and synchronization with command and control assets outside the AO which assures the reach capability within the AHS and the ability to rapidly deploy medical specialty care resources as the need arises in the AO.  Follow-on operations or operations being conducted simultaneously outside the AO which can include a range of military activities. D-17. Army Health System planners—  Identify the level of detail required and the time available to conduct the medical aspects of the IPB process.  Evaluate existing information/intelligence of medical significance and identify intelligence gaps. (Sources include:  National Center for Medical Intelligence; Defense Intelligence Agency; the Army Public Health Center; The Office of The Surgeon General, Intelligence and Security Division (division or higher staff for intelligence); country studies; supporting intelligence staff officer/assistant chief of staff, intelligence or military intelligence unit; Central Intelligence Agency World Fact Book; open source information system; tourist maps and brochures; public health resources; World Health Organization; Pan American Health Organization; Department of State; and internet, libraries, and other informational sources).  Identify and submit collection requirements to the supporting intelligence staff section/element/unit.  Collect required information to fill gaps. Medical Intelligence 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 D-5 Note. If medical personnel gain information of potential intelligence value through casual observation of activities in plain view while in the performance of their humanitarian duties, they are required to report it to their supporting intelligence staff officer/assistant chief of staff, intelligence. Population Demographics D-18. Population demographics include the effect on the delivery of health care to supported forces and the effect on the AHS if required to support the local populace and nongovernmental organizations. It also includes the political effects of providing care/not providing care to the host-nation populace, nongovernmental organizations, and dislocated persons and the effects of cultural, religious, or language barriers on medical treatment.Other AHS population demographic concerns include:  Condition of the general population (and or supported population) to include an analysis of the health of the general population and the impact of it on deployed forces; analysis of the infant mortality rate as this serves as an indicator of the overall health of the population; leading causes of death; identification of the status of nutrition; and state of advancement of the medical infrastructure.  What effect will clans, tribes, gangs, opposition groups, or paramilitary organizations/groups and organized crime have on the ability to provide AHS support to deployed forces and other eligible beneficiaries?  What effect/additional requirements will dislocated persons and detained personnel have on the AHS system? This is of particular importance for the operational public health arena as camps require sanitation, pest management, and potable water support. Other requirements include the provision of sick call services, outpatient treatment, hospitalization, MEDEVAC, veterinary technical consultation and support, MEDLOG support (to include sorting, repackaging, inventorying, and disseminating donated medical supplies and equipment), and other functional concerns.

The object of threat integration is to relate how essential elements of information identified in analysis of the medical aspects of IPB process will affect the health of the command, the employment of AHS resources, as well as enemy/friendly courses of action as they pertain to medical issues. Further, information that is gathered relating to resources and background information should be consolidated in a usable format for use as the need arises. Some useful formats for managing information and medical intelligence include overlays, spreadsheets, matrices, and databases. D-31. Threat integration can be broken down into three major categories. It is important to note that in each category the threat relates only to the health of the command or medical issues. Similarly, the type of threat can vary greatly with the type of mission or operation (offensive, defensive, and stability tasks). These categories are—  What friendly courses of action are best supported from an AHS standpoint? What friendly AHS courses of action best support the mission?  What probable enemy courses of action could affect friendly AHS units/resources/services?  What geographic-related threat issues impact AHS support? Geographic-related threats include climatic/weather-related threats and their impact on the need for and delivery of AHS and terrain- related issues that can best be depicted by creating a modified combined obstacle overlay. CONSOLIDATION D-32. Understanding and consolidating additional elements of medical information/intelligence into concise formats assists the planner in future planning efforts or other possible contingencies. Databases are particularly useful for managing general information.

The Army Medicine has a long tradition of providing world-class medical care across global operational areas, OEs, and under austere and challenging conditions to the joint force. Wherever an injured or ill Service member is located, the United States Army will project its resources to locate, acquire, treat, stabilize, and evacuate our wounded Service members to MTFs capable of providing world-class health care to enhance the prognosis, mitigate disability, and empower them to lead full and productive lives. E-2. Historically, Army Medicine has provided acute trauma care, curative, restorative, rehabilitative, and convalescent care within the AO. Soldiers were not evacuated for care in the CONUS-support base unless their recovery time exceeded the theater evacuation policy (in some cases up to 60 days). E-3. With the advent of technological innovations in transportation and medicine the last few years, Soldiers can be stabilized and rapidly evacuated from austere OEs to world-class fixed MTFs in CONUS or other safe havens in a matter of hours to days from the time of injury or wounding. These advancements have—  Enabled the essential care in the operational area concept to be implemented.  Reduced the medical footprint present in a deployed setting without reducing the quality of medical care provided to our Soldiers.  Optimized the use of scarce medical resources.  Enabled wounded and ill Soldiers to more rapidly be reunited with their Families and personal support structures to facilitate and enhance the healing process. MISSION FOCUS E-4. The mission of the institutional force is to generate and sustain operational Army capabilities.The Army does not organize the institutional force into standing organizations with a primary focus on specific operations. Rather, when the institutional force capabilities perform specific functions or missions in support of and at the direction of joint force commanders, it is for a limited period of time. Upon completion of the mission, the elements and assets of those institutional force capabilities revert to their original function. E-5. All elements of the Army, whether the institutional force or operational Army, perform functions specified by U.S. law. The Army executes Title 10 and Title 32 USC directives, to include organizing, equipping and training forces for the conduct of prompt and sustained combat operations on land; accomplishing missions assigned by the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense and CCDRs; and changing the force to meet current and future demands. Below is the list of USC Title 10, Armed Forces, Subtitle B, Army functions:  Recruiting.  Organizing.  Supplying.  Equipping (including research and development).  Training.  Servicing.  Mobilizing.  Demobilizing.  Administering (including morale and welfare of personnel).  Maintaining.  Constructing, maintaining, repairing buildings structures,  utilities, and acquiring real property and interests in real property necessary to carry out the responsibilities specified in this section. Appendix E E-2 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 E-6. The Army Medicine serves as a critical link between medical formations in the operational and institutional force to leverage capability and capacity across the Total Army. The Army Medicine and joint force medical formations Service members receive the best health care anywhere in the world. THE SURGEON GENERAL E-7. According to General Order 2020-01, para 37, The Surgeon General is the principal military adviser to the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army on the health and medical aspects of manning, training, and equipping the Army and serves as the principal military adviser to the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserves Affairs) for health affairs. E-8. The Surgeon General is responsible for—  Assisting the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserves Affairs) in developing policies and programs for the Army system for health and planning and supervising the execution of those policies and programs.  Representing Army health policies and military health readiness requirements to DOD, executive departments, Congress, and nongovernmental organizations.  Providing technical advice and assistance to the Secretariat and Army Staff for matters on public health, readiness of the force, warrior transition care, medical force structure and equipping, force development, medical materiel and research and development, medical training and education, medical evacuation, and medical military construction.  Developing and directing the Army’s Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution process for the Defense Health Program.  Assessing Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and DHA health affairs policies and programs.

E-10. The DHA's administration of the TRICARE Health Plan provides worldwide medical, dental, and pharmacy programs for over 9.4 million members of the uniformed Services, retirees, and Family members. SUPPORT TO THE TACTICAL COMMANDER E-11. The institutional force fulfills numerous critical roles with regards to supporting the Soldiers deployed in an operational area. Army Medicine organizations conduct operational development activities and medical Institutional Force Support to the Operational Army 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 E-3 research and development to discover and field advanced technologies to mitigate the health threat faced by our deployed forces. Army Medicine institutional forces facilitate and enhance medical readiness of Soldiers through the promotion of fitness and healthy lifestyles, the Performance Triad, and the prevention of diseases and injuries. Army Medicine institutional forces provide mobilization and predeployment support to ensure that Soldiers are mentally and physically ready to be deployed (immunizations, predeployment health assessments, dental, vision, and hearing readiness testing and treatment, and health risk communications on health hazards in the operational environment. During deployments, they provide reach back support through medical specialty areas and can deploy teams comprised of physicians, scientists, technicians, and other health care providers to provide solutions to unique health threats or medical conditions and issues occurring during the deployment. EDUCATION E-12. Educational requirements within the health care professions are significantly more complex than in other branches of the Army. Formal accredited schooling is required for fields within Army Medicine and professional education is received in civilian educational and DOD medical organizations. Medical education is a lengthy process, which is often accomplished in phases (such as, medical school, internship, and residency). Medical professionals require credentialing and licensure before they can practice medicine. Credentials are most often obtained from non-DOD affiliated civilian organizations. Health professions also require continuing education to maintain certification. Headquarters, Department of the Army, Office of The Office of The Surgeon General facilitates this process by providing global opportunities to fulfill the continuing education requirements health care professionals across the Total Army. TRAINING E-13. All medical military occupational specialties require school training. Medical skills are perishable and require continual practice and refresher training. The MEDCoE provides military occupational specialty- specific training for award of medical military occupational specialties and provides refresher training for some low-density for Reserve Component forces and United States Army National Guard when mobilized. Additionally, the MEDCoE develops and fields collective training materials and distance learning programs. In some medical specialty areas, the didactic portion is completed at the MEDCoE while the resident phase is conducted at Role 4 MTFs. ARMY MEDICAL ACTION PLAN E-14. Military personnel are treated at DOD MTFs in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and civilian medical facilities to provide world-class health care and services for their dedication and sacrifices to the nation. In support of this plan, the Chief of Staff of the Army approved the actions to be implemented to include:  Establish and institutionalize a command and control structure for Service members undergoing long-term definitive, rehabilitative, and convalescent care.  Prioritize mission support and create ownership of actions and processes.  Flex housing policies and focus on Family support issues.  Develop training and doctrine to facilitate and ensure a system which provides timely and effective support.  Create full patient visibility throughout the Army and Military Health Systems continuum of care and facilitate medical information sharing across agencies to improve patient outcomes.  Improve the medical evaluation board process and eliminate delays in the process. E-15. The intent of this action plan is for the Army to provide a continuum of integrated care and services from POI or wounding, illness, or disease to return to duty or transition from active duty. It is vital that the Army coordinates execution of the necessary changes at the strategic, operational, and tactical level to ensure a simultaneous transformation of care and services over all lines of operations to achieve the desired end state. Appendix E E-4 FM 4-02 17 November 2020 THE ARMY RECOVERY CARE PROGRAM E-16. The Army Recovery Care Program (ARCP) (formerly the Warrior Care and Transition Program) serves as the proponent for the case management and transition of the Army's seriously wounded, ill, and injured Soldiers. The program provides oversight, guidance, and advocacy for wounded, ill, and injured Soldiers, Veterans, and Families through a comprehensive recovery plan aimed at successful reintegration back into the force or into the community with dignity, respect, and self-determination. The ARCP includes an oversight and policy headquarters (a staff directorate of the U.S. Army Medical Command) and 14 Soldier Recovery Units. E-17. The Soldier Recovery Units (see Figure E-1) are strategically postured at 14 installations aligned to division and corps headquarters with the capacity to manage care for 2,800 active, U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard Soldiers. The ARCP provides a total force solution for wounded, ill, and injured Soldiers and the program utilizes multi-component cadre designed to meet the needs of the population. More than 80,000 Soldiers have entered the ARCP, with a population peak of nearly 12,500 Soldiers in 2008. The program's motto, "Recover and Overcome," helps inspire Soldiers that their condition does not define them or their legacy. The health, humanity, dignity and respect of each individual Soldier remains paramount as the program remains scalable to meet future Army requirements. The foundation of the program includes:  Single entry criteria for all components concentrating medical and administrative resources on Soldiers with complex case management requirements.  Program and policy that supports goals and requirements based on individual Soldier requirements and point of recovery.  Advocacy and non-clinical case management through transition to Veteran status and beyond.  A comprehensive recovery plan supported by an interdisciplinary team including military leaders, transition coordinators, adaptive reconditioning specialists, and behavioral health professionals to help Soldiers realize their transition or career goals. Figure E-1. The Soldier Recovery Unit SOLDIER RECOVERY UNITS E-18. The Soldier Recovery Unit is a total force solution open to Soldiers, regardless of mechanism of injury (in the line of duty), who meet the single entry criteria. The Soldier Recovery Unit is comprised of four platoons: Headquarters platoon, Complex Care platoon, Veteran Track platoon, and Return to Duty platoon. Each platoon is designed to meet the case management requirements of Soldier Recovery Unit Soldiers, and Soldiers are assigned to platoons depending on the primary stage of their recovery. This organization enables the Soldier Recovery Unit to concentrate personnel and services in accordance with each Soldier's individual recovery requirements. Two critical components of the Soldier Recovery Unit are the Triad of Leadership (TOL) and Triad of Care. Institutional Force Support to the Operational Army 17 November 2020 FM 4-02 E-5 E-19. The TOL consists of senior commanders/command sergeants major, MTF commander/MTF ASCCs commanders/command sergeants major, and Soldier Recovery Unit commanders/command sergeants major. Soldier Recovery Unit entry packets are reviewed by the TOL but the senior commander on a Soldier Recovery Unit installation is the final decision authority for Soldier Recovery Unit entry. E-20. The triad of care consists of the Soldier Recovery Unit Medical Provider, nurse case manager, and platoon sergeant/squad leader. The TOL and Triad of Care work together in conjunction with the interdisciplinary team to ensure advocacy for Warriors, continuity of care, and a seamless transition into the force or return to a productive civilian life.

The appendix does not attempt to produce all conceivable combinations for AHS symbols or control measures, but rather, it shows several examples of each type as a starting point. Readers should refer to MIL-STD 2525D and ADP 1-02 for more information about military symbols. F-1. Military symbols are governed by the rules in MIL-STD 2525D. Army Doctrine Publication 1-02 is the Army proponent publication for all military symbols and complies with MIL-STD 2525D. F-2. Army Doctrine Publication 1-02 provides a single standard for developing and depicting hand drawn and computer-generated military symbols for situation maps, overlays, and annotated aerial photographs for all types of military operations. A military symbol is a graphic representation of a unit, equipment, installation, activity, control measure, or tactical task relevant to military operations that is used for planning or to represent the common operational picture on a map, display, or overlay. Chapters 4–7 of ADP 1-02 also provide an extensive number of icons and modifiers for building a variety of framed symbols. Refer to Table F-1 for medical main icons. Table F-1. Medical main icons Function Icon Note. The icon has been enlarged for better visibility and is not proportional to the orientation or example Example Hospital (medical treatment facility) Medical (Geneva cross) F-3. Sector 1 modifiers depict unit capabilities. These modifiers show the specific functions that the unit is organized and equipped to perform.

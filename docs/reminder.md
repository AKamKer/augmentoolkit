# Conventions Are Minimal and You Can Just Code and It Will Probably Work

Augmentoolkit literally calls Python functions with the fields of config files as kwargs. When making a custom datagen pipeline, if you're not sure about how to start, just code Python and it will work out. This is a PSA to remind that Augmentoolkit is very flexible.

Also, the [New Pipeline Example](example.md) and [Abstraction Primer](abstractions_primer.md) make GREAT LLM context if you want an AI to do your coding for you.

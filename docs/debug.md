This is a simple health check pipeline, intended for mostly development use, which confirms that the ability of Augmentoolkit to execute a pipeline is still working. It remains as an example of how basic Augmentoolkit pipelines can theoretically be.

This pipeline does not even use an LLM. Its config is extremely basic and self-explanatory.
